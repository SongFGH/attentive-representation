0	men of a certain age will remember how , when we were kids and this was played on tv in the early 80s , we thought it was so cool when a huge army of police officers fired so many shots into a house that it eventually collapsed , and when a bus was shot full of holes by an even larger army of cops . but those two over-the-top scenes are all this movie has going for it . the other action scenes are pretty silly and unbelievable , especially scenes involving a sniper in a helicopter , and atop a parking structure , both of whom were in `` ca n't miss '' positions and missed anyway . moreover , if you know anything about law the plot is beyond silly . it involves eastwood being sent from phoenix to las vegas to escort a witness being extradited back to arizona for a trial . the witness will testify about bad behavior on the part of the phoenix police commissioner , and a corrupt assistant district attorney is involved with the commissioner in a coverup . assuming a material witness can be extradited , which i doubt , the crime appears to have been committed in vegas , so it would tried in vegas , not phoenix . and if the ada prosecuting the case was corrupt and wanted to cover for the commissioner , he could just dismiss the case , and there would be no need to murder the witness . the idea that they would want to draw attention to the case by having 200 cops line up and try to assassinate the witness is beyond ridiculous . in sum , the plot and the action were both absurd , and the only interesting scenes were the crazy firepower overkill at the house and on the bus . but those two scenes probably ca n't carry the entire movie for the average viewer .
1	in this movie based on a true story we see jerry stahl played by ben stiller . jerry is a geek hollywood scriptwriter who turns out junk for sitcoms although he thinks he is shakespeare by his admiration of his own writing . jerry has it all- a hollywood mansion , liz hurley , a cool car and yet he decides to throw it all away for some heroin . jerry 's heroin habit costs $ 6,000 a week but he is only earning $ 5000 ( ! ! ! ) per week . one does not need a phd . in advanced mathematics to realize this this spells trouble . jerry eventually gets clean with the help of maria bello and then he wrote his story in a best selling book . one can only hope that his new fortune does not lure him back into the drug scene . i give this sorry excuse of a movie 5 stars because it has maria bello in it although i still ca n't figure out why she finds jerry the geek so interesting . his story is the same as any street junkie.they all look the same to me when they are injecting heroin into their veins on the street
0	movie boring ... story drags ... barely any action ... if story drags should have atleast good story to keep interest but it had nothing ... booo

1	with king creole , love me tender and stay away joe - jailhouse rock 1957 is elvis presley at his best . he declined the old musical tradition of mgm and insisted on a contemparary look - especially how the choreography should be executed . in this film we see elvis presley at his very best . he was a stunning actor - much more prefer him to james dean ... it`s a shame he made more or less 33 forgettable films ... . only a handful stands out and jailhouse rock is the best . it isn`t a classic - it isn`t even great . but we have elvis - the king - and that`s the best there is : - ) )
1	wow , i just viewed `` spun '' the other night and i thought this movie was outrageous . this is sort of a guilt-pleasure movie but you want to take shower afterwards . `` spun '' has an impressive cast of recognized actors . the film is , essentially , about a few days in the lives of a group of drug addicts . there is the cook ( mickey rourke , he truly makes this story worth watching ) , who makes the drug ( speed ) and sells it to spider mike ( john leguizamo ) , a dealer with a junkie girlfriend , cookie ( mena suvari , looking infinitely less attractive than she did in `` american beauty '' ) . one of his clients is ross ( jason schwartzman ) , who does a lot of favours for the cook and his girlfriend , nikki ( brittany murphy ) . i was surprised at how funny the film was at times . it does n't drown us in anti-drug messages , nor does it become one of those , equally tedious , drug films where you feel like the sober driver at a drunken party . the humour is dark , certainly , but funny nevertheless . a lot of it comes from a subplot about frisbee , patrick fugit , who is caught by a couple of tv policemen ( peter stormare and alexis arquette ) and is told he will be let off if he helps them get spider-mike . i will only say of the resulting sequence that he does it with all the subtlety of an undercover policeman with his badge stuck to his forehead . this is a film with a lot of energy , that seems , like its characters , not entirely sure where it is going , but determined to get there , and quickly . although i am sure it is boring to be surrounded by people on speed when you are sober , this film almost makes you feel like you are on speed too . the director , jonas Ã¯Â¿Â½kerlund , has directed music videos in the past , and it shows in his impatient filming style , as he plays around with animation , speeded-up camerawork and such like . i 'm not recommending the film for its style though , although i am sure it is the best way this material could get to the screen . i am recommending it because i liked the main characters , which i think will stick in my head for much longer than the animated sex scenes or the split screens . i can imagine an entire film about the cook and nikki , or spider mike and cookie , or even just ross , who absentmindedly keeps leaving a girl handcuffed to his bed for hours/days . what makes `` spun '' better than those hypothetical films is that it puts the characters into their own little community , and we feel as if we are watching their everyday , speeded up , sleepless lives . simply amazing .
0	i had high hopes for this movie , marlon brando , robert deniro , and edward norton , how could i go wrong with this movie with a cast like that ? despite the cast this movie sinks under a terrible script . the film is often tedious and the characters never seemed very realistic to me . this was a poorly contrived and at times silly film . the tension never really builds even though the filmmakers try . embarassing for all involved . i only give it two stars to be nice to the cast
1	'torzÃ³k ' ( 'abandoned ' ) is a brilliant hungarian film written and directed by ÃrpÃ¡d sopsits that takes us back to hungary of 1960 when the oppressive communist rule altered the lives of everyone , especially children . the quality of the film is absolutely first rate from story to acting to filming to scoring . it may be a tough film to absorb and certainly not for the easily offended , but it is a perfectly honed gem of a film that deserves wide audience exposure . Ãron ( tamÃ¡s mÃ©szÃ¡ros ) is a young lad whose life seems warm at first until suddenly a disease of vision impairment attacks his mother and his parents divorce : the mother is somewhere in a hospital and the father ( sÃ¡ndor gÃ¡spÃ¡r ) beats the boy and eventually turns him over to a rigid orphanage for boys run by cruel taskmasters . Ãron undergoes initiation tactics by his fellow orphans but despite the beatings he is strong enough to survive . he is befriended when he has his nightmares about his mother 's blindness by his friend atilla ( szabolcs csizmadia ) and the two bond emotionally and physically . in this bleak atmosphere a little light comes from the beautiful young housekeeper anya ( krisztina somogyi ) but even her contributions are compromised by the cruelty of the staff . there is one 'teacher ' in the orphanage school , nyitrai ( lÃ¡szlÃ³ gÃ¡lffi ) who has been reduced to his position as an 'imprisoned one ' by the government and his sadness is offset by his playing his cello and studying his beloved astronomy . nyitrai offers Ãron solace and introduces his 'fellow traveler ' to the glory of the stars , giving Ãron a map of the heavens that Ãron cherishes - his window to a world beyond the dark confines of his prison-like orphanage . he gradually wins over his fellow orphans and when nyitrai , in the pit of depression for his life situation and the cruelty of the orphanage and the government , hangs himself . this horrid incident drives Ãron to organize an escape from the orphanage , an event that is ultimately fractured with a death for which Ãron feels responsible . and the end of the film fades into the many possibilities that event could trigger . the atmosphere created by the stunning cinematography by pÃ©ter szatmÃ¡ri defines the darkness that represents the orphanage well but also suggests the darkness in hungary of that period . the musical score by pÃ©ter fejcsik , tamÃ¡s gÃ¶rgÃ©nyi , ferenc toma , and balÃ¡zs winkler is some of the most beautiful composed for the screen , making tremendously effective use of the cello and lower strings . in all , this is a brilliant piece of filmmaking , acted with depth in every role , and unveiling a portion of history and tragedy too often pushed to the background of our books . highly recommended . grady harp , march 06
0	the virgin suicides starring kristen dunst , josh hartnett , kathleen turner and james woods lacks depth and a convincing storyline . this film is directed by sofia coppola ( lost in translation ) , i really tried to like this movie but i was fooling myself , you would think this movie would be a hidden gem because of the coppola legacy but just because your father is frances ford coppola does n't mean you belong in the same category as best director of all-time . sometimes magic does not stirke twice . how can all five sisters end up killing themselves , their homelife was n't that unbearable , a lot of parents are religious , but that does n't mean you 'll wind up with thoughts of impending suicide . kristen dunst just gets on my nerves , her acting is the same in every film . do n't believe the hype , the virgin suicides is not a groundbreaking , poetic film
1	tom cruise gives an excellent performance as imf agent ethan hunt , who is framed for murder after the death of his imf team.together with the help of two other imf agents , hunt sets out to find the real murderer.cornered most of the movie and set to his limits , hunt and team are hard put to catch the assailants.it all leads to a final showdown on a speeding bullet train with an unlikely foe.hard core action and awesome intellegence meet in this exhillirating action drama by filmmaker brian depalma
0	this movie is so bad . it is just about a annoying valley girl blonde who is rich and has tons of friends and who has no real problems . the only people who like this movie are the ones who wished they were the main character , a pea brained airheaded ditz who has no redeeming qualities . the movie tries hard to invent new `` teen speak '' with tons of lame catch phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who liked the movie so much , they tried to sound like the shallow empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the movie 's fans live the life nowhere close to cher 's and look nothing like her but they want to pretend . the movie hits you with these lame catch phrases every 15 seconds , desprate to beat you over the head with them . in the movie , the main character , cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to her . nasty ! she is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship should be jerry springer . she 's supposed to be a posh valley girl but at the end , she 's like ella may clampet going after jethro when all her resources for finding a man runs out .
0	i think i just do n't like pilates because i really did n't care for this workout . plus , you are constantly roling up and down and from years as a ballet dancer we have always been taught that rolling your spine when working the stomach will not flatten the stomach it will cause the muscle to bulk up in your stomach and you 'll have a round hard belly . this is not my idea of an attractive waist line and this is true because it happened to a girl in one of my classes . so , that 's the main reason i just did n't like this video
0	after watching `` harsh times '' we wondered `` is this a comedy or are they just mocking inner city life ? '' we could n't believe what we were watching . it was meant to be the new 2006 version of `` training day '' -- they even got christian bale to play the lead role -- but only in the eyes of the people involved in it . it was a miscalculation and we 'll explain why . brief story : the movie takes place mostly in the dangerous inner city streets of l.a. jim davis ( christian bale ) is a mentally unstable young iraq war veteran . now in the states , he is looking for a job as a cop . jim 's best friend mike alonzo ( freddy rodrÃ­guez ) is also unemployed , but when his friend comes to visit , they prefer to hang out and commit all kinds of illegal activities -- selling drugs , guns , getting high just to name few . to spend time with his friend , mike has to lie to his girlfriend sylvia ( eva longoria ) making her believe that he is looking for a job . she does n't know the world of crime they are involved in and the terrible consequences they might face . review : `` harsh times '' has many problems , but the most notorious one is the crime `` video game '' feeling it has throughout the film . the characters and situations are so unbelievable that the whole thing feels like watching a `` grand theft auto '' or `` scarface : the world is yours '' video game adaptation with a little bit of `` cheech chong '' in the mix . there is no climax -- we just see them driving to different places , arguing among themselves and committing all kinds of crimes without anything conclusive until the very end . christian bale 's accent in this movie does n't help either , not only it changes through out the film , but we are not sure what kind of accent he is trying to emulate . the dialogue between the two friends feels forced and teenager-like -- also there is no chemistry between them . the acting in this movie is disappointing , especially from bale who we liked in movies like `` american psycho '' , `` batman returns '' and `` the prestige . '' it is clear that he was miscast this time . he just can not do what denzel washington did in `` training day . '' because of his accent and terrible acting in this film , we believe this is his worst performance to date . this is something he does n't want to add to his resume . the verdict : christian bale returns , but this new american psycho can not find his equilibrium . `` harsh times '' tries too hard to create the edgy , dramatic style of the dangerous inner city life that `` training day '' had , but it does n't even come close to achieve that goal . we laugh at the silliness of the story , overdramatic acting and christian bale whose fake accent in this film has to be the worst of the year . he probably thought he was going to get nominated for best actor . this is a miscalculation of great proportions by him and his agent .
0	p.s . has potential . both grace and linney are great in it , but midway through the movie loses its mystic and gets boring . it 's a shame because it could 've been a great movie . great acting with a bland plot
0	whoever made this film is obviously trying to impress upon the viewer the idea that artists are deep complex people . but all i see in the film are low life drug addict losers who sit around ( few of them seem to have jobs ) and party all day . the main character ( sid ) is a pseudointellectual who claims she majored in critical theory in college ( ultra liberal nonsense which has the goal of undermining western culture to pave the pathway for marxism ) . the film appeals to naive youth
1	its amazing how strongly images and music can impact the senses without any spoken word . this is a great film to throw on , relax , and absorb .
0	is a bad sequel and have a poor quality of special effects
0	i have now seen several gerry anderson projects , many hits and some misses , this one is close to dead last for me ( wait , it is dead last ) . a priest driving a model t is the hero in this one . he also has a shrinking ray ( shrinks to like 1/3 normal ) that he uses on his assistant who is a groundskeeper/secret agent . sound interesting ? well , i got the set cheap so why not buy it ? if your an anderson fan as i am , it was worth the price , just do n't expect to show it to your friends as it 's really tame and slow plodding with model t car chases and not a whole lot of action . here is my ranking of the shows i like from gerry anderson so take that into account of your own tastes . # 1 ufo ( a live adult sci-fi show with some great character development ) , # 2 joe 90 ( the concept is great and the non continuous storylines work good here ) , # 3 captain scarlet ( i love the concept and a lot of the shows fit in with the current war on terror to me ) , # 4 thunderbirds ( had a corgi toy as a kid , it was the best show for kids on tv at the time ) , # 5 stingray ( for the time , it was a great action kids show ) , # 6 fireball xl5 ( like a stingray except in space and black and white ) , # 7 the protectors ( eh , it 's ok ) , # 8 space 1999 ( this is where my recommended shows stop , this show was so highly anticipated and quickly got really stupid even i could n't stay with it in the 70 's ) , # 9 terrahawks ( just started watching it now it may move up above space 1999 and the protectors ) , # 10 secret service . i have n't watched his other stuff and i know there is stuff out there like supercar but that would probably rank above secret service for me .
1	this is definitely the best ab workout . working in a desk job , i kept gaining weight around the ab area . after just two days of this dvd , i had results . it was incredible . the fat around my abs just kept shrinking and shrinking . i would recomend this to anybody . no matter how fit you are , there are four levels of difficulty . practically anybody can do the first level . i do all four . already i am seeing results . i hope he puts out more videos for upper body strength as well . can not stress how fast the results are . you will probably see results within a week
1	it 's not a great movie , but it 's a lot of fun . this is one of those movies that just catches me . it 's quirky and has some decent ( for it 's day ) effects . there are a feww laugh out loud momments . truth be told they are few and far between . some great bit characters make up a fun ensemble . the cast is pretty damn cool , with urich being upstaged by ron pearlman , angellica houston , john mat.. mattus ... the big guy . anyway , it 's cornball comedy with a basic plot . hey what do you want ? it 's 80 's chessy goodness and more fun that it should have been . i still giggle at the time warp battle
0	i have probably never seen a movie with quality as bad as this . even my old tapes from tv were 500 % better . the picture was faded , the characters looked like they were 90 years old and the sound track was off so badly that it also garbled words , so looking away from the movie did not help . it is also one hour long -- but seemed like three-probably a copy of a tv movie as it also had cuts for commercials though i could not find any place that said this . it was advertised as a 2 hour dvd-and it is -- i guess , but i could not see any more of it . at the end of one hour , it just showed credits and it was over . i am returning it-and it is the first copy of a dvd that i have ever returned for picture and sound quality
0	this dvd was a total disappointment . first of all , this video was a rip off of baby genius series , but without the production value . second , this video promises to introduce your child to fruits and vegetables and healthy eating habits . to be fair , there are fruits and vegetables , but not so cleverly disguised in this video you will find dead and burned animals ( grilled turkeys etc . ) and rotten milk ( in other term cheese ) , chicken period ( eggs ) , ice cream ( i think it 's a child abuse to feed your 6 month old ice cream ! ) and other non-fruit and non-vegetable foods . this video shows a toddler chewing on a hunk of parmasan cheese that 's bigger than baby 's head ! i believe it is morally right to properly advertise your product and not misrepresent what your product has to offer , especially when it comes to offering children first look at health and nutrition . i would not recommend this video for vegetarians , vegans , or other parents looking to teach their children proper health and eating habits .
1	my 2 yr old son has watched this dvd again and again . he 's not into cartoons , so the real life airplanes , trains , and buses suit him perfectly .
0	jackie is only in a brief clip in the beginning , stolen from the real drunken master . this clip is entirely unrelated to the movie , and is very short . buy this if you want , but not because you think it has jackie in it
1	good subject , the workings of a devious female mind . a complicated love triangle . superb acting
0	i purchased this movie without reading the reviews , based only on my fondness for older movies and the other movies i 've seen the two main stars in . this movie was awful , and the sad part is , there were sooooo many opportunities to save the movie all throughout . the acting was obviously overdone on purpose , i just wish i knew why - it did n't come off as funny or as a satire if that was the intent . in the end - i threw out the dvd so as not to accidently subject someone else to it
1	this thoughtfully prepared collection of 3 buster keaton movies , 2 shorts from early and late in his pre-feature period , and the feature seven chances , show a wide range of comedy styles , from slapstick , to more refined visual humor , to what we would today call situation comedy , where laughs come from unusual or embarrassing encounters . the earliest in the collection , `` neighbors '' from 1920 is in some way the most satisfying of the set , although keaton had not yet here fully developed his mature style of humor . here there is still a stylistic resemblance to the earlier association with fatty arbuckle . the backyard love affair , for example , that opens the film resembles arbuckle 's 1915 classic `` fatty 's plucky pup '' . in neighbors there is more story , revolving around the standard theme of feuding parents , and the eventual need for the couple to elope . there is sweetness , youthful energy , and innocence in the entire movie , as well as great acrobatics , including the innovative climactic escape involving two levels of men being carried on the shoulders of other men . the balloonatic ( 1923 ) , near the end of the period in which buster was making short films , is less rich in comic ideas and lacks the energy and freshness of the earlier film . there is almost no slapstick but rather visual humor involving being trapped in a balloon and trying to survive in the wild and win an unwilling girl . keaton loves using bodies of water and other objects of nature for comedic props , and this film is full of them . still , for once keaton seems uninspired , perhaps making this film to fulfill a contract requirement rather than for love of the story . the feature in the set , seven chances , from 1925 , is based on a single theme : buster , the rich boy down on his luck , must get married by the end of the day in order to inherit 7 million dollars . this absurd premise induces , for much of the film , a hal roach-like situation comedy rather than the visual , acrobatic style that is more associated with keaton , as buster is cornered into continuously proposing marriage to strangers . the variety of embarrassing rejections that buster must endure has funny moments , but may not satisfy all of buster 's fans . the climax , however , returns us to tried and true keaton formula : the lone man being chased by a thundering herd , in this case , of angry women in full wedding apparel , fed up at being duped by a newspaper ad submitted by buster 's colleague unbeknownst to buster . the chase has satisfying moments , including buster dodging large bolders . although worth seeing , the reliance on the single absurd premise makes this film feel more like a dragged out short movie than a genuine feature . the result is a slightly less satisfying encounter with keaton 's genius .
1	i am saying this as an italian american myself.. quit bashing the show because it portrays are small portion of italian americans.. its a tv show and a darn good one..it does not portray us all like that ... just this mob family..so quit being so sensitive and lighten up frances ... and ps..i do not care if this was help or not either !
1	loved them all ... found victoria albert and lorna doone a bit lacking . wondered about having more of the scarlet pimpernel offered - he 's so smooth ! tom jones is very special - loved sophie 's father , he truly made the film . as much as i liked him - hated lizzie 's mother in p p - what a ninny ! this is a great collection , would have liked to see vanity fair and persuasion offered also
1	hey ... this is a great dvd with great packaging -- definitely one of the best that i 've seen , and there is a lot of extras . definitely a must-have for he-man and she-ra fans ! i just got an e-mail stating that the distributor of he-man will be releasing she-ra on dvd , starting july 11 . that release will be `` the secret of the sword '' and five other episodes deemed most popular by fans . after that , in the fall they will release the complete 93 episodes in three separate volumes within the next 12 months . for anyone who wants to see for themselves , go to tvshowsondvd.com and look at the news for she-ra . i hope you are as excited as i am
0	ehhhhh . what is this ? this is one very stupid movie . how do i get a refund
0	once again , the powers that be at amazon have chosen to refuse to tell us if ( in this case ) the darin/dee flicks if a man answers and that funny feeling are in widescreen or not . pan-and-scan is garbage , and we wo n't buy it ! ( that 's why i only gave 1 star for now . if they turn out to be widescreen , i 'll give them both 5 stars . ) `` format : color '' does n't cut it . color is n't a format , anyway - it 's a specification or type . widescreen is a format ( as is dvd and vhs , to begin with ) . so why the deep dark secret about certain movies , amazon ? you list many others as being widescreen , so why do you go on to neglect so many other hundreds , though ? if it 's a standard screen piece of junk , go ahead and say so , and be done with it , and we 'll boycott it . but right now all you 're doing by holding back this important information is slowing down sales
1	robert ryan made a number of westerns during the 1950s and '60s , but always he seemed to be overshadowed by other actors in the genre . nevertheless , who can forget the wild bunch or his magnificent portrayal of `` old man clanton '' in the seriously underrated hour of the gun ( with james garner ) . and his self-effacing determination is equally unforgettable in the day of the outlaw . now one of his best roles , as the straight-arrow sheriff in the proud ones is on dvd and available at a very reasonable price . finally . the proud ones is perhaps director robert webb 's finest picture , combining great action scenes and plot twists , taught dialogue , and a superior cast that includes not only ryan , but jeffrey hunter , walter brennan , virginia mayo , and robert middleton . minor roles are given attention as well , especially arthur o'connell ( as ryan 's deputy ) and , important thematically , the wonderful paul burns , who plays the town drunk and panhandler ... .hunter , when he finally assumes the mantle of sheriff , will give alms to burns at the finish of the movie , just as ryan did at the beginning , when he was sheriff . this touch dramatically completes the movie and has much to say about hunter 's increased maturity . the proud ones is a superb movie , with a great story ... it will repay re-viewing . unlike some westerns , i do n't tire of watching it periodically . it is that good ...
1	for those reviewers who have not seen the remakes , see dail m for murder by alfred hitchcock , perfect murder starring michael douglas and gyneth paltrow , not to mention countless tv movies of the week . this is the original and the best.barbara stanwyck is superb , as is burt lancaster . moody and dark and suspenseful .
1	i saw this thai horror film about 3 years ago . i have to say this is the best supernatural thriller made from thailand , and i have seen a fair share of them ( nang nak , the sisters , mae nak , art of the devil series ) . the film focuses on tun and his girlfriend jane . tun , a photographer reunites with his old friends . on the way home , they accidentally hit a girl with their car and from then on , tun sees ghostly apparitions whenever he takes pictures or whenever he tries to develop them . ok , i am not spoiling anything , the story is more complex than it sounds . tun and his friends have a past that catches up to them , with jane caught in the middle . as usual , there is a vengeful spirit going around killing people . `` shutter '' refers to his camera and what it represents . `` sometimes the dead can not let go of their loved ones.. '' i 'm stopping here , i do n't want to give out anymore . the plot is not that complex , but believe me when i say , the film is well-made . it does a great job of putting things together , each shocking scene is linked to the past and the present . i did n't see any scene wasted and it has that very atmospheric , creepy feel to it . also , there is a scene in the movie that tun and jane looked at actual photos of ghostly apparitions in a polaroid . honestly , this film has some great scenes that can make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end the very first time you watch it and the `` shock ending '' has the greatest twist of any horror flick i 've seen ! i 've seen a lot of horror films , only the exorcist and the omen ever scared/creeped me out , and shutter came very close . my female friends were scared out of their wits when they saw it at my place . since i have n't seen the tartan release and i only own the region-3 dts-es rlease from panmedia ( hong kong ) but tartan usually uses the same transfers from either the hong kong or korean versions . the video is sufficient , with some dark and bright contrast . it is not free of grain but it does add to the atmospheric feel . the dts soundtrack is great though , very crisp and loud . the english subtitles are excellent , the thai language track is the only way to watch as it was meant to be seen . a definite must-see if you are a fan of asian horror or horror films in general . it rivals ringu , one missed call and the original ju-on 1 and 2 . four and 1/2 stars !
1	this dvd showcases a somewhat new ( as of the 2001 recording ) sound for sade , with slightly poppier and quicker supporting music . however , sade 's voice adapts beautifully , and she is one of those singers who just does n't need the standard studio treatment to sound tremendous . her buttery , chocolate lyrics come through with mesmerizing clarity on this dvd . after a few years of owning this dvd , i still enjoy and am transfixed by the wonderful editing , sound , and lights on this dvd . i highly recommend it to add to your `` chill-out '' collection . no longer the jazzy sade of yesteryear , the versatility of songs on this long ( almost 2-hours ? ) dvd will keep you grooving for hours
0	the quality of the dvd 's was good . however i did not like the third season as well as the first two seasons . it seemed that the story was setting up for season 4 .
0	i would often rush to see all arnold schwarzenegger films , i adore his bad acting `` it must be the muscles '' i was 10 year old and he was the bomb now his movies now gives me a pain in my stomach and i start to twitch , i ca n't believe how terrible an actor this man was `` is '' and all the money he made doing these unrealistic bull crap , wow ! talk about the american dream , i admit there are some of his movies i would have to rate a classic but however this one really sucks maybe it was the time , trend , maybe the era , but i have come a long way and this guy is a difinite no ! no ! for me , this movie had it 's moments ! for a 8 year old maybe ! for an adult you have to have a strong stomach , you i would never say this about bruce willis mybe i am a hypocrite or maybe he just an good actor duh ! i could n't care less do with this what you will i wo n't recommend it later folks
0	this is a review of the dvd , not the world series . please save your comments re the series for the sports blogs . in this day and age , for major league baseball to produce a non-anamorphic dvd is absolutely pathetic . this dvd was made for a widescreen tv ( 16:9 ratio ) , but can not take advantage of it , because it is non-anamorphic , meaning it will not take up the full widescreen . it has black bars on all four sides . they may as well have made it full screen instead , with a 4:3 ratio . also , in its rush to make a lot of money by getting the dvd out quickly , they decided not to include footage from the season , to show nothing of the tigers ' play-off run , and to provide mostly filler with worthless interviews from players . ( `` gee , was it exciting to be out on the mound ! '' ) i am an avid cardinals fan , but this dvd was not worth the $ 14.99 i paid for it . major league baseball , as usual , cheats its fans . another lesson they fail to learn from pro football
0	what an incredible waste of acting talent `` there was a crooked man '' turned out to be . director joseph mankiewicz celebrated for classics such as `` all about eve '' and `` the barefoot contessa '' should be embarrassed by this bomb . kirk douglas plays paris pittman jr. a charming , persuasive prisoner incarcerated in territorial prison for ten years for an armed robbery that netted him $ 500,000 . he hid the loot prior to his capture . it 's presence is common knowledge among the inmates giving him celebrity status . newly appointed warden woodrow lopeman played by henry fonda is trying to use douglas ' influence to coax the inmates help him initiate prison reform . under the guise of playing along with fonda , douglas secretly plots his escape to be reunited with his ill gotten cash . with an excellent cast including hume cronyn , burgess meredith and lee grant , i expected a whole lot more than this disappointing flick delivered
0	it 's good to see that in his twilight years , old squinty eyes , clint eastwood is growing comfortable playing grouchy old dudes , because , well , he is a grouchy old dude . this movie is anemic from the beginning . taken from a wonderful novel by michael connelly , clint plays an old grouchy dude who 's just gotten a new ticker because his last one gave out while chasing a serial killer . run , run , run , thud . next , new ticker intact , clint is hired to find the murderer of a cute black woman by her sister , another cute black woman . oh , and cbw # 2 plays the guilt card on clint , because he 's got his new ticker courtesy of cbw # 1 . so there 's a little bit of investigative work , a little but of huffin ' and a puffin ' , and finally clint discovers who the serial killer is who was responsible for his first ticker giving out and the murder of the donor of his second ticker . jeff daniels plays a doofus that lives next door to clint . what a stretch . special warning : clint takes off his shirt yet again in this film as he smooches on cbw # 2 . it must be in his contract or something . no one , and i mean , no one wants to see saggy clint with his shirt off . for a much , much better clint movie , go rent `` unforgiven ''
0	this movie is a rehash of the first , but it is a crappy , unconvincing , emotionally uninspiring movie . let me guess what part 3 will be about : a guy who looks at video or pictures goes back in time , does not alter that timeline the way he wants ( i.e . always worst case scenario ) and ends up killing himself in the end for the sake of everyone else
0	despite the talented cast this is perhaps the most ridiculous film ever.a goofy hippy copy laughs along the way trying to catch an eleven murder serial killer.this writer did moonstruck , but this is moonstink.seeing rod steiger with this material is a tragedy.the case is a joke , the characters are impossibly lame , and the dialogue would gag a collie.this film is worth seeing only to gain appreciatiation for the value of screenwriters.no amount of acting talent can lift this turkey out of the bankok privey.i just watched this film and at the conclusion i just sat there with my mouth open not believeing how bad the film was.saradon , keitel , kline , steiger , and rickman ... .will try and forget this dog their entire lives . i can not imagaine how any studio or distributing company let this turkey reach the public.have i gotten the point accross that the film is weak ... .i hope so.if i could give it zero stars or even better , minus eleven stars , i would
0	incredible does describe this movie- incredibly bad ! this movie does n't know what it wants to be . at times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of `` mississippi burning '' or the anger and impunity of `` ghosts of mississippi '' , or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre . at other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors , matthew mcconaughey and sandra bullock . as a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre 's list of movies for lack of originality , and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make . some of my favorite actors are wasted , either by being given cliched dialogue , over acting , or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence . if this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book , then i have no interest in reading the book . i 'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper . but the direction does n't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own . bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role , proving she 's only worthy of b-grade `` miss congeniality '' type crud . mcconaughey over acts so much ( as can be said for keifer sutherland and others ) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of patrick mcgoohan , kevin spacey and donald sutherland . samuel l. jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever , but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in . even the extras in this movie are horrible . enough ca n't be said about the terrible direction in this movie , equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault , making sergio leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison . this is not `` a powerful film . '' it 's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast , a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience , and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions , culminating in an over the top , pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by mcconaughey that would n't hold water in any real court of justice . maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt , or because they have n't seen quality comparisons and classics like `` mississippis burning , '' that has both a great script and fabulous acting . i do n't know . all i know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started . among the top of my most over rated movies
1	this film released in late 1984 , is about a married man named rob salinger ( the late dudley moore ) who secretly marries another woman during his current marriage . rob is a newspaper editor married to micheline `` micki '' salinger ( ann reinking ) , a judge . while secretly romancing maude ( amy irving ) , he proposes to her ( maude ) . rob has babies by both women and in one of the last scenes , they ( the women ) both meet and converse about their respective simultaneous marriages . but rob keeps both wives . in the real world , bigamy is undoubtedly illegal . director blake edwards ' previous film credits include breakfast at tiffany 's and the pink panther . subsequently , he directed the late john ritter in 1989 's skin deep
1	i think pauly shore is much more talented then people give him credit for . it is not as easy at it seems to play the character he played in every single one of his films . but the problem is that he has played the same character in all the movies he made . frankly i dont think he made this movie or started his new reality show to restart his career , i think he probably knows that he is a living joke , i feel he is just trying to give people a laugh and i 'd say hes done that
1	swiss-austrian actor von sydow very good and look for john wayne as ro- man soldier who uses title line
0	they spend the first half of this movie saying how great the ultimate warrior was . the journey is awesome ! then all of the sudden , the paid wwe guys just began to bad-mouth the warrior . maybe he did have questionable judgment - but why are they trying to make us feel bad about someone we loved ? they take some very low blows . they say that the warrior was a bad wrestler . actually he seemed just fine to me when i was young , and i really ca n't distinguish one 's ability from the other . they just all gang up on him and make outragious allegations . vince says quickly that the reason why the ultimate disappeared for 3 years was because he failed a drug test . as soon as he says this , they fade to black then come back with a new issue . what drug use ? which drugs ? presumably they 're talking about steroids . but what about that high and mighty hulk hogan with his admitted drug use . let 's not talk about that - let 's just keep ganging up on the warrior . they completely ridicule him changing his name to the warrior . and they also just try to badmouth him so much . who cares that none of the wrestlers liked him ? i do n't ! he excited the heck out of me way more than any of the dorks who say bad things about him -including hulk . and oh yeah - they do n't even let the warrior defend himself . why did i have to find out from imdb.com that he was asked to appear but declined ? why do n't they address this ? this `` docu '' is more slanted than `` fahrenheitt 911 '' every wrestling and ultimate warrior fan will start out loving this docu then hating it . it just leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth , tired of all of the whining and bitter trash talking .
0	there are no words to describe how awful ( ! ! ! ) this `` movie '' was from beginning to end , but let me try anyway so as to give people a fair chance to avoid it and thus try and prevent their day/evening from being ruined : the film supposedly deals with a woman who has an accident and is `` touched '' by a sex angel only to discover she is a sex addict and the twelfth sex apostle ... need i say more ? the plot , the `` humor , '' the dialogues , and the music are way beyond `` below average . '' there is next to no nudity and there are no , i mean 0 as in zero beautiful girls , in this film ! as for the acting-oh my- the acting is beyond words ... school plays ( and pre-school for that matter ) have better actors ! it is truly sad ... rent or buy ( ha ha ha ) at your own risk . you have been warned !
1	i am a faithful csi watcher , and have been since the shows inception . i buy the dvd sets and enjoy them tremendously . however , there are two trends i see developing that i do n't care for -- -one , there is too much catherine . we know everything about her kid , her dead husband , her crook father , etc. , and she 's really an annoying character . she makes nasty comments about everyone ; she 's always being insubordinate ; she goes out with men half her age ( let 's quit trying to make her seem like a young chick when she is n't , especially wearing those skin tight jeans ) , she is very arrogant , and even though she continually screws up ( loses her camera ; blows up the lab in a previous season , accuses people before she has all the evidence ) , they made her a supervisor . also , the plot line with grissom and sara , while predictable , is not the greatest . i think grissom would be better off paired with lady heather . there 's an idea ! let 's see more of lady heather . still , even with the annoying overabundance of the least likable character ( catherine ) , the show is one of the best , if not the best , on tv ( up there with without a trace , ncis and numbers ) . keep 'em coming
0	love the movie , but the quality of the dvd put out by alpha video was so bad it was very difficult to watch . the sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up . if you do n't want to be disappointed and feel like you 've been ripped off , wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one
0	anything having to do with paris hilton is doomed to be garbage . the premise of the story is trite and in the end leaves the audience wondering `` whaaaaa '' . the only person not to die is scottish and that 's the only reason why he didnt ; because he 's scottish . what ? ? ? ? ? sick plot , dumb characters overall dulllll . how many movies will they make with `` a group of friends in a secluded castle '' yes i borrowed the movie which is great compared to paying $ 20.00 for the dvd and wasting my money and time watching it . yawwwwwwwwwwn ! !
0	if you love well written stories , great plots and captivating acting then this movie is not for you . i do n't know how the producer managed to swindle precious investor dollars to get this tripe made into a movie , however there it is ! it was so boring and so badly done that after the first 1 hour and 45 minutes i had to turn it off . i do n't even want to know how it ended . the cast line up was great ! that 's the only 'positive ' comment i can make with regards to this movie . do not watch it . do not hire it . do not believe anybody who thinks it is good . the two lesbians who made love even did that scene poorly ; get this , it was done in the missionary position ! avoid this movie
1	ray sawyer ( rick cramer ) , agnes bruckner ( eden ) , laura ramsey ( rachel ) , jonathan jackson ( eric ) , and d.j . cotrana ( sean ) star in this scary and bloody slasher movie . eric and eden are going through any typical teen romance ; going steady one minute , broken up the next . eden works at a local truck stop as a waitress . one evening , ray pulls into the truck stop to get some food . known as the local nut case , ray has few friends and owns a filling station on the edge of town . later that same evening , ray comes upon eric and eden on a lonely bridge . swerving to miss eric 's jeep , ray instead crashes into an on-coming car . the impact of the crash sends the car slamming through the guardrail of the bridge . the car is now teetering precariously on the side of the bridge . ray jumps from his truck and goes to the aid of the woman inside the car . after pulling her to safety , ray goes back inside to retrieve a suitcase that the woman told him about . however , both ray and the car tumble over the side of the bridge and into the water below . to make matters worse , the suitcase is full of poisonous snakes , who immediately begin striking at ray . all that can be heard are ray 's screams as the car sinks . ray 's body is pulled from the water and taken to the local morgue . but it does n't remain there for long . it seems that the woman in the car was a voodoo priestess , and the snakes were used to `` cleanse '' people by drawing the evil out of them . now , the evil venom is flowing through ray . now begins a bloodbath of carnage as ray , possessed by the power of the evil venom flowing through him , begins to stalk unsuspecting victims . one by one , he exacts his revenge on eden 's friends until only eden remains . who will win this final showdown ; ray or eden ? i 've always been a big fan of slasher-type films , and characters like freddy from the `` nightmare on elm street '' series , as well as jason from `` friday the 13th '' . ray sawyer fits the mold of the typical slasher perfectly . the motives are the same ; kill as many teenagers as possible , and ray succeeds in this very well . i thought the story involving voodoo was well-conceived . the special effects were good , too . i recommend this movie to horror and slasher fans . although the movie is short ( only about 80 minutes ) , there 's lots of slashing in a short amount of time . if you enjoy a good slasher flick , then do n't miss `` venom '' .
0	we have a lawman who for no explained reason starts to investigate the cause of death of a man with 500,000 on him and it all goes down hill from there . there is no rhyme or reason to the story . i gave it two stars because the landscape is great
0	i remember going to great lengths to fit a matine showing of heaven 's prisoners into a busy saturday afternoon during its 1996 theatrical release . considering the source material and the talent behind and in front of the camera , our little filmgoing party of detective-film fans and alec baldwin groupies ( a.k.a . my mom , my stepfather , and me ) found this contemporary film noir to be a big disappointment . baldwin , who also served as co-producer , brought james lee burke 's new orleans ex-cop/recovering alcoholic hero dave robichoux from the printed page to the big screen . while baldwin and the rest of the cast did well in fleshing out burke 's characters and have some tangy tough-guy/gal dialogue , they 're hampered by two things : 1 . ) the film 's slo-o-o-ow pacing . maybe the louisiana heat got to everyone , not just baldwin . of all the actors , long island native baldwin sweats the most , so much that it began to remind me of the sweating-bullets gags with albert brooks in broadcast news and robert hays in airplane ! 2 . ) a plot that , as rendered in the film ( whether it 's the fault of the screenwriter or the editor , i ca n't be sure ) , never quite follows through on any of its elements . it 's too bad , because these elements could 've made for an exciting movie : drug dealing , illegal alien smuggling , rival crime bosses ( one is played colorfully by eric roberts before he became a parody of himself , essentially playing a southern-fried version of his character from director phil joanou 's 1992 thriller final analysis ) , an adorable little salvadoran orphan girl ( named `` alafair '' by the robichouxs , after dave 's mom . late in my pregnancy at the time , i liked the name alafair so much , i nearly changed my mind about naming my then-unborn daughter siobhan ! ) , and a bevy of beautiful , beguiling women , including earth mother kelly lynch , vampy teri hatcher in a full-frontal nude scene that was much ballyhooed at the time , and mary stuart masterson , looking like a young jessica lange in what was then a change-of-pace role for her : a troubled stripper who loves robichoux . despite the sexy promises in the movie 's ads , none of the ladies share anything with baldwin but dialogue and some kisses and/or embraces . maybe the climate was already so hot , the filmmakers did n't want to add any further steaminess for fear of poor baldwin collapsing from heat prostration ! as my mom put it at the time : `` i thought the height of my day would be seeing sexy , dashing alec baldwin , but he came up sweaty , rumpled , tired , depressed , and moving as if he was in slow motion . if he 'd made love as many times as he got beaten up , it would 've been the sexiest picture of '96 ! '' to be fair , there *are* a number of strong characterization and action scenes , but there 's just too darn much talky , molasses-paced lag time between them -- and yet , oddly , some of the scenes end abruptly just as they 're about to become intriguing ! perhaps joanou , baldwin co. could 've dredged a tighter , more involving thriller out of this if they 'd whittled the 140-minute running time down to 105 minutes or so . as heaven 's prisoners is now ... well , read james lee burke 's books instead .
1	after starting my 9/11 odyssey from ignorance to full blown `` what ! '' after `` loose change - 2nd ed '' last year , i 've watched and or read just about them all . 9/11 : press for truth comes out on top , in my humble opinion , as the best 9/11 timeline presentation out there . nothing included that is n't in the mainstream press - just on the back page , and spread out over five years . the film makes few of the outright accusations that `` loose change 2nd - ed '' does towards any of the events or people involved in 9/11 , but delivers more of damning argument that we 've been lied to - there were n't just mistakes made , but distortions and deceit at the highest levels of our government . i hope that we , the people , finally demand a real investigation and the truth comes out . and the bad guys pay . good movie
0	well not to bad a deal.most of the movies here are n't too bad ( the inspector general , a farewell to arms , a star is born etc ; ) and have basically clear picture and sound quality.it 's true several of these are silent but even a few of those are good.there is a problem with this set however , after you 've watched these movies once they will begin to wear out my mother and i discovered this when we wanted to watch `` the flying deuces '' for the second time the film was a lot more blurry and it was difficut to hear some of the dialogue.my advice is not buy this collection unless you find it for sale very cheap , and to just rent some of the better ones.we did get a few things out of this my mother said that she discovered buster keaton , w.c.fields and charlie chaplin because of this for instance , ( and after we liked father 's litle dividend we decided to watch father of the bride which was even better ) so i have decided to give it an extra star just for that
1	i have not gotten into watching the dvd as of yet because i am still watching the reruns on tv , but i know i have no qualms with the dvd . i have bought all the series thus far . it is a collection to have in your library if you are indeed a fan
0	this is a surprisingly poor movie . although it has some well-known actors , and a notable director , the material was just presented badly and predictably - like a lousy late night tv-movie with profanity inserted to liven it up . the movie makes a simplified joke of the legal system and its sterotypical failings ( though legitimate in many cases ) . it also glosses over the grieving process of the family , ignores the normal safety warnings to the remaining child , overdoes kiefer sutherland 's character flaws ( which are considerable nevertheless ) , and generally oversimplifies everything into a neat package to which you already know the ending because of the spoiler title . in one particularly-bad scene , after taking martial arts classes and other measures to prepare herself mentally and physically , sally 's character simply stares open-mouthed and dumbfounded at keifer 's character when they meet on the street and he talks to her . i do n't know what i missed that the 4- and 5-star reviewers like so much . i only see wide-spread mediocrity . i would only recommend this for fans of keifer . `` ssssssorry '' , sally , not your best role or movie . ditto ed harris , whose other movies i generally like .
1	we enjoyed this video . the rugby athletes are fun to watch in such a surreal setting . somehow , these tough , big athletes being posed and shot in various homoerotic poses gives new meaning to `` sporn '' .
1	this movie is my all time favorite . my friends and my sister enjoyed watching this movie and we watched it over and over .
1	based on bizet 's tragic spanish opera , this was rita hayworth 's first film made by her production company , beckworth ( derived from her screen surname and from the name of her daughter , rebecca ) . she decided on her close friend and favorite leading man , glenn ford , as don jose to her carmen . the results are far better than some reviews would have you believe . the glorious , lush techincolor is fabulous ( studio-bound as most of the sets may be ) , while hayworth 's unforgettable screen presence , dancing and bewitching beauty , and the heat generated between her and ford makes this movie memorable . the sequence in which she describes what virtues a lover should have ( complete with putting her finger to his lips ) sparkles with sensual static . granted , ford looks stiff and ill at ease in his uniform ( after he sheds his soldier garb and dons his `` bandit clothing '' , he appears much more relaxed ) . if it is deemed worthy enough to be released as part of the columbia classics collection , so should `` affair in trinidad '' , another hayworth/ford collaboration . it 's just great to look at , flaws aside . if you adore rita and glenn , even in a tempestuous , volatile romance , this movie will provide that for you . was there ever a more enticing , tempestous gypsy with so many men in her life but only one true and ultimately tragic love ?
0	i would have liked a more real story in this dvd
1	great movie with great sound and visuals . what it on a hd tv and get blown awa
1	i really enjoyed this dvd-and all of the combos were doable with great breakdowns . the instructor actually starts with the left foot , so you can follow her mirror image . i teach dance and will definately use a lot of these moves . and , you will work up a sweat , if you want more just do jumping jacks or run when they march . enjoy
0	i had several friends insist that i rent this film . i 'm glad i did instead of buying it . i was not bowled over as they obviously were - quoting lines from it and all but wetting themselves remembering scenes from the film . now , i 'm not a hard guy to make laugh , but there was only one point in this film where i actually laughed out loud . other than that , i found sordid lives to be just tediously amateurish and more than a bit forced . i love southern humor and even poking fun at southerners : i ca n't tell you how much i love greater tuna , fried green tomatos , steel magnolias , etc . but this just did n't cut it for me . the cast is a who 's who of excellent character actors : beau bridges , bonnie bedelia , leslie jordan , olivia newton-john ( for pete 's sake ! ) , erik krieger , delta burke and gobs of others . no , it 's not a shortage of talent that this film lacks . i found that it was a lack of a cohesive direction that made me wince more than once . there 's a scene with ty ( an out of the closet to everyone but his parents young man who lives in west hollywood ) talking to his ex-girlfriend in the reception area of their therapist ... well , as a theatre director , i can only tell you that the performances during this one scene are so painfully badly acted and the pregnant pauses between the lines are so large you could drive fleets of trucks through them . there are various filming techniques that del shores ( the director ) uses that are just hackneyed : filming from behind a person 's back so that only the back of one person 's head and the facing person are seen . why ? it feels like a testimonial `` video '' from mtv 's real world rather than an actual film . frankly - and this is not always a bad thing - the whole film felt like it was a play converted to film . it can be a great thing ! look at altmans ' come back to the five and dime jimmy dean and you 'll see how a good stage to film movie is done . but this ... well , it 's just amateur hour from my perspective . in all , the film felt like a poor man 's greater tuna ( two quick change artists playing 16 characters living in texas ' 3rd smallest town ) , which was a stage play and was filmed for hbo as a stage play rather than attempting to make it feel like a film . i wanted to like this film , but i just did n't
1	this video is awsome if you dont like this video then you ca n't be t true pantera fan . it doesnt get any better than this except for live . watch it go ! ! !
0	this film offers none of the cheap thrills of a horror film , and has many flaws : a silly plot , cheap religious imagery ( dracula is judas , jeez louise ) , and not one truly sexy or scary moment . and it wastes three gorgeous gals as dracula 's brides , including jennifer esposito jeri ryan . if you ca n't make a film sexy with these two , you 're in the wrong business . craven has an over inflated rep as a director , he does n't deserve any rep as a producer , if this leaden film is a sample . it makes the worse universal horror film look like citizen kane in comparison . save your money and pick up something scary instead , like bava 's black sunday or any hammer horror
1	do n't listen to anyone when they say this movie is bad , it 's good . elektra is filled with aciton , and fx and supervillians ! elektra is one of the best marvel movies ! go see it now

1	screenwriter charlie kaufman 's reality-bending work has become such a hollywood staple that he is becoming more distinctive than the directors who give life to his wildly imaginative and solipsistic scripts . he dares to give dramatic form to nebulous psychological states that border on horror stories . directed by michel gondry , this 2004 study in love and loss is no exception , as kaufman takes the notion of a struggling relationship and inverts it into a manic piece of science fiction involving a medical procedure to scrub one 's memory . at the same time , gondry and kaufman have injected a strong dose of humanism into this film by grounding it with characters that are relatable as much as they are quirky . the labyrinth plot focuses on shy , taciturn joel barish , who is swept off his feet by the raucous , unstable clementine . much to his dismay after a particularly ugly fight , he discovers that clementine has impulsively decided to erase all memory of her relationship with him through a medical company called lacuna headed by the benevolent dr. mierzwiak . a renowned leader in his field of memory erasure , mierzwiak treats the heartbroken joel to the same procedure as clementine 's . however , joel is overcome by the intensity of emotion from this act of reciprocation and starts rebelling against the deep consciousness treatment to regain his memories of clementine . the surreal twists and turns that occur boggle the mind of the viewer but not in a way that alienates us from joel 's plight . it helps that a sturdy cast has been recruited starting with a surprisingly subdued jim carrey as the depressed joel . this is easily his most effective attempt at a straight dramatic role even though gondry allows him to provide flashes of his manic personality when appropriate . displaying no trace of her corseted britishness as the bedraggled free spirit clementine , kate winslet shows the right level of abandon and leavens it with her natural earthiness . tom wilkinson is his usual steady self as the somewhat remorseful mierzwiak , while his spirited trio of assistants is played with relish by kirsten dunst , mark ruffalo and elijah wood . all three are fine with dunst particularly affecting toward the end . the looping narrative could have spiraled out of control had it not been for the stellar work by cinematographer ellen kuras , production designer dan leigh and editor valdis oskarsdottir , all combining to bring much-needed fluidity to initially incoherent scenes . the only fly in the ointment is jon brion 's overly intrusive music . the 2004 dvd has several extras , the best of which is the consistently informative commentary track by gondry and kaufman , which helps explain some of the more bizarre plot turns . there are two featurettes - a standard ten-minute making-of short and a fifteen-minute conversation with gondry and carrey that borders on banal . seven minutes of understandably excised scenes are included , as well as a creative music video of the polyphonic spree 's `` night and day '' and a faux-commercial for lacuna
0	this production is misleadingly named . far from being a biography of grand duchess anastasia , it is really the story of how the deaths of her family at the hands of russian revolutionaries in 1918 spawned one of the 20th century 's enduring mysteries -- a mystery which was given a unique lease on life when , among the myriad male and female claimants to be survivors of the imperial family , one woman began to pick up supporters in the 1920 's among at least some people who had had contact with the original family . i do not fault this production for failing to be a real biography . after all , how much of a biography can one write on a 17-year-old girl whose life was largely one of sheltered privilege ? however , i do fault this production for being a badly-flawed recounting of history . and i am not talking about the interminable debate that still rages in the arcane world of romanov history buffs about whether anna anderson was really anastasia . this work 's take on the life of anastasia paints a very tilted picture both of the world of the romanovs , their support among their subjects , and their reputation among today 's russians . first , life in the inner sanctum of nicholas 's family was not the halcyon existence this production claims . certainly the family had great wealth and huge staff at its disposal . but neither nicholas nor alexandra were well-suited to their roles , and they lived under the strain of it . they were increasingly isolated from the extended romanov clan , who shared the dawning awareness of the russian people that the monarchy was in serious trouble . while these forces might not have touched anastasia directly , she was certainly touched by her brother 's hemophilia and her mother 's response of sinking into frail health , chronic emotional distress , and a religious mysticism that almost bordered on hysteria at times . secondly , this film 's portrayal of the counter-revolutionary white army as determined to save their beloved tsar from captivity is just plain wrong . while the whites wanted to unseat the bolshevik revolution , there was virtually no support for a romanov restoration among the leadership of the white army . nor are there any known attempts by the counter-revolutionary forces to rescue their former imperial family . in fact , one senior white military leader once remarked , `` having seen the monarchy at close quarters , i have no desire to see its return . '' and thirdly , while there is a gradual rehabilitation of the last romanov 's reputation underway in russia today , the notion that the murdered romanovs are saints is not nearly the widespread sentiment that this production claims . in fact , the great masses of modern russians are far more interested in making their new democracy work than in figuring out how to get the sainted romanovs back on a throne . i do not know whether these flaws arise from some agenda to rehabilitate the romanovs , whether they arise from sloppy research that relied too much on the fawning pseudo-history that plagues serious study of the russian monarchy 's fading years , or whether this production did not have access to newly-opened archives . but -- whatever the reason ( s ) -- it does a disservice to the study of history by claiming to be history when it is , in fact , closer to a grocery-store romance novel
0	'clownhouse ' is mainly associated with a sex scandal involving the director and the youngest boy actor . while hearing of salva 's conviction when 'jeepers creepers ' came out , i never knew it had anything to do with this movie , nor had i ever heard of this in the first place . i actually stumbled upon this looking to see if there was a horror movie involving clowns besides 'it ' , and came across this weird little 'halloween'-like suspense tale . while the sex scandal never once popped into my head ( except when there was a pointless and gratuitous butt shot of the kid ) , i still did n't care for this too much , despite its pluses . like 'halloween ' , this film relies on suspense rather than gore to creep people out , but sadly , it did n't really get to me . if i was about 9 or so , this would 've scared the hell out of me . i 'm not saying i hated this ; it was all right and had some geniune chills and some fantastic images , but because you see who the clowns are before they find the house and start terrorizing the children , it lost some effect for me . i would have liked it better if i had no idea what was going on , and it would 've been a creepier experience . horror movie fans should like this , even though i personally thought it would be better . the atmosphere is very , very creepy , and the clowns are actually pretty terrifying in their own way , but it just did n't do it for me . rent it first
0	i 'm a huge don cheadle fan , but this film is unworthy of him . [ people ] who claim that it 's a story about racism either do n't understand the film or do n't understand racism . basically , here 's the plot : the character played by mekhi pfeiffer is an unwitting accomplice in a botched armed robbery that leaves three people dying on the floor of a grocery store . rather than summon help for the others , all pfeiffer can think to do is help himself to the money in the cash register . he is caught , and in the ensuing trial the prosecutor calls him an animal because of his depraved indifference to human life . that is supposed to be the psychological turning point in the film , because pfeiffer 's family insists on proving that he 's no animal and can take his punishment -- in this case , death -- with his head held high . yeah , right . guess what ? he is an animal , and if the story had involved all-black or all-white characters , racism would n't be an issue . a more compelling question : if pfeiffer 's family was so concerned with his `` dignity , '' why did n't they teach him moral values in the first place
1	i loved this film . the writting , story , special effects , acting , and directing exceed the original . i recomend this film to any fan of the genre
0	i just watched this movie version of the classic childrens ' book with my wife . here are my gut impressions : first , very little is true to the book . that 's not really a gut impression . that 's the impression i got hearing my wife say `` that 's not in the book ... that 's not in the book ... '' actually this movie is more like a computer animation demo than a vehicle for story telling . it makes for beautiful stills and pictures , and those made me want to see the movie . i expected a heart warming christmas story , and what i got was about an hour of frantic scenes of out-of-control railroad and other technology animated like never before with just enough pauses betwen them to remind me why i 'm watching . you get to see ... a kid chasing a ticket through a train , a kid chasing a ticket over the roof of a train , a ticket making its way through the forest -- rube goldberg style -- back to the train , ( forty minutes into this movie and one girl 's train ticket is the star of the show ! ) ok , the ticket sub plot is resolved and we have ... a train sliding out of control on the ice , a train trying to outrun cracks on the ice , a train going full throttle out of control and racing up and down mountain valleys like a roller coaster ( fans of the `` coaster tycoon '' series of computer games will feel right at home ) until finally it arrives at the north pole . then , the train car with the central character kids gets detached so we have ... a train car running out of control through santa 's village , kids getting lost in the christmas present manufacturing plant and falling through the chutes and machinery of the factory , and then ... kids getting lost in a bag of presents that is taken by a flying machine to santa 's sled launching pad where the star at the top of the tree is dislodged and nearly impales an innocent elf . ho ho ho . at least let me have a joystick and a couple of buttons so i can help these kids out ! it 's like a computer animated train wreck in fast motion . you know it 's awful but you ca n't look away ! and , you 'd better think twice before letting any very young children see this . it could be very frightening on a big screen with the volume turned up . my wife and i were going to watch it with our three and six year old sons , and we were very glad that we did n't . so , what could have been a classic , enduring , and endearing compliment to a classic childrens ' christmas story is little more than a great line for some computer animator to have on his or her resume . two thirds of this movie is devoted to stuff that does n't advance the story or develop the characters one bit . whatever a `` character driven '' story is , this is the opposite . never have i seen so many rendered pixels doing so much and accomplishing so little . i 'd rather set up my old american flyer electric trains and let them run around the tree while i read the book to my kids .
1	i have owned a copy of this film for a long time . i have probably watched it ten times , and i always tear up a little at each viewing . from the beginning newsreel , of a shell-shocked diane feinstein announcing the less than hour old murders of harvey milk and mayor george moscone , to the final reel of harvey milk 's prophetic and haunting statements , the viewer is mesmerized . though harvey milk was a san francisco city supervisor , his election in the 1970 's , that of an open and unrepentant gay man , made national headlines . he was a ray of hope to gay people everywhere , who at that time were unrepresented and , for the most part , still forced into the closet . this film not only gives insight into the philosiphy of harvey milk , but is a rare document into that not so long ago but seemingly ancient time . milk was a very eloquent speaker , and his sensibility , logic , and unapologetic viewpoint more often than not made mincemeat of any verbal opponent . this is best displayed in the footage of his debate with then california senator briggs , a buffoon like character , who not only was a terrible speaker , who could n't even clearly express his arguably irrational fears , but who in fact seemed much prissier than his nemesis milk . the public view at that time was about family values , with the anita bryants condeming homosexuals to hell for their decadent ways ( old times come round again ... . ) . milk 's voice opposed this view openly , and he seemed to predict his early demise at the hands of an assassin who was against what he represented . the notion of this martyrdom , and its romantic though fateful attraction to milk , has been argued . nevertheless , his bravery in representing the unrepresented can not be argued , and the sordid details of his love affairs and personal life should not diminish his message , nor the admiration he deserves . this film unfolds as it happened , seeming like fiction , but all too real . as milk is assassinated , along with the mayor , by the homophobic and disgruntled resigned supervisor dan white , whose subsequent trial , with the famous `` twinkie defense '' , and his being sentenced to an appalling five years for the murders , resulted in riots the likes of which the city had never seen . as one of those interviewed here expresses with sad resignation , ... if only the mayor had been killed , white would have gotten life , but the fact that milk , a gay man , had also been killed , leaned public sympathy towards white , an absurd but all too realistic conclusion.there are many moving , telling , historically signifigant moments in this film , but none so clearly represents those times , and milk 's loss and legacy , as the film of the nighttime march in san francisco right after the murders . seas of people , holding candles and standing silently , came together in a very moving moment in time . this film , which won best documentary at that years oscars , transcends its subject matter , and is simply a great documentary . gay rights have made much progress . and perhaps time has diminished their names and these memories to most all , excluding those who were there , are old enough to remember , or are gay . nonetheless , harvey milk is a representive and icon of the early gay rights movement , and his legacy , through schools named after him , organizations , and his place in history as a voice for the all too often voiceless , lives on .
1	i grew up with the original ds . i also saw the two `` spin off '' movies : `` house of dark shadows '' and `` night of dark shadows . '' needless to say i was extremely excited about the `` revival , '' and i was n't disappointed . i felt that dan curtis was actually able to improve upon the original , by tightening up the script and employing wonderful actors who fit like the proverbial glove . the original barnabus was played by jonathan frid who was a shakespearian trained actor and , ben cross is a member of the royal shakespearian theatre in london . i loved that the revival was able to be more overtly sexual , which as any fan of vampires must know is an essential element of the myth . and i must say this series lived up to my every expectation . dan curtis took the original and made it completely accessible to older viewers who have such fond memories of the 1963 soap opera . i looked forward to 3:30 every day after school . it 's too bad that the gulf war killed it . yes it did ! i was there . after the sunday , monday miniseries , that friday was to air the first `` episode . '' however it was pre-empted by coverage of the war . too , too bad . i taped it , but unfortunately the last few episodes were accidentally taped over . i am so glad to know that i can order it now in it 's magical entirety . i 'm ordering it right now ! thank you amazon ! ! ! ! ! ! ! if you are a fan of things that go bump in the night , you will love this series ! ! ! !
0	this is the french x-rated version of 99 women , directed by jess franco . the running time of this feature is 98 minutes , which means that this is probably the longest , least censored version of the film that is available . the story involves a women`s island prison , a sadistic female warden , a lustful male governor , and the young , lovely female inmates . can you see where this is heading ? there are scenes of extreme sexuality ( especially when you consider the film was released in 1969 ) which include ( ... ) . my big problem with this movie is that the hardcore scenes are haphazardly edited into the film . in a few cases , they don`t even seem to be part of the scenes that you have been watching . also frustrating is the fact that some of the actors taking part in the sex scenes look nothing like the actors that they are doubling ( standing-in ) for . just because a woman is wearing a blonde wig does not mean she is going to look like the lead actress that she is portraying . i guess that this movie was pushing the boundaries in 1969 , but looking at the dumb story , lousy editing , and sex scenes from a 2005 perspective ... ..this is just a dated curio
1	i have always liked this movie . along with the horror , there 's some comedy thrown in .
1	this video is great for the beginners and the advanced beginners . i started taking a vinyasa class and was unable to coordinate my schedule with class times so i looked for a video to supplement my practice at home . what a great choice . baron baptiste takes his time to explain the poses and provides the mood that is needed to practice yoga at home . i highly recommend this dvd
0	i was purchasing rockin ' wheels ( the one with the train and fire truck ) for my son , and the truck adventures came up as a combo deal with a discount if you bought them together . we borrowed the rockin ' wheels dvd from the library and he liked it so much , i thought it would be good to have two different ones . however , the truck adventures is not as good , and my son does n't even ask to watch it . the songs are lame and so is the narrator . do n't bother

1	i bought this dvd because i was getting sick of the other dvd 's that claim to be pilates workouts . this pilates work out is very imformative and very beneficial . i am actually seeing results from this workout after only 3 weeks . karen also keeps you motivated to continue . not to mention the benefit of getting two 50 minute workouts for the price of one . beware that you need a resist-a-ring for one of the workouts though , and those can be difficult to find . great , great workout and i would recommend it to anyone
1	the series just keeps on getting better . the bob newhart show was one of the best comedies ever on television . the other funny show was `` newhart '' , which i can not understand why it has not been released on dvd . the whole cast just clicks . i wish shows like this were still on television . if you enjoy a good laugh then buy this and the other sets !
1	until sam raimi made spider-man , i think we all regarded tim burton 's batman as the best superhero movie ( even though i actually do n't consider batman to be a `` superhero '' because he has no superpowers ) . burton directed this movie , and did a great job - this movie looks like it takes place in the 1920s , except that society is a lot more technologically advanced than it really was back then . michael keaton is batman/bruce wayne . needless to say , batman is wayne 's alter ego . keaton is magnificent at playing the character 's alter ego . keaton also does a good job playing the character when he 's not in costume . keaton 's bruce wayne is n't as gloomy as christian bale 's was in batman begins , which is n't necessarily a bad thing . but i would say bruce wayne was a little too cheerful for my liking in the schumacher movies . but overall , bale 's bruce wayne is superior to keaton 's because bale has a much more developed character to play . however , keaton plays a better costumed batman than bale . the problem with this movie is that the joker ( jack nicholson ) steals the show - the whole movie revolves around him , so this is n't batman 's movie . this movie should have been called `` the joker . '' so if you ever wondered why nicholson got a higher billing than keaton , now you know . the thing is , the writers never bothered to give bruce wayne a personality , and they barely scratch the surface of the character 's background - we know practically nothing about wayne . you 'd think the guy that 's batman would n't be so uninteresting , but we 're bored to tears everytime wayne 's onscreen ( and out of costume ) . but when keaton is onscreen in the batman costume , batman seems so menacing and captivating that you enjoy all of his scenes . he plays an even more menacing batman than bale - so i say that keaton does a better batman than bale , but that bale does a better bruce wayne than keaton . but keaton did n't have anything to work with , so it 's not his fault his bruce wayne is so weak . but one of the strengths of keaton 's performance is that if you ever met wayne , he 'd seem like the last guy in the world that could be batman . that 's something kilmer and clooney failed to accomplish , but thankfully bale was able to do it . michael gough is a delight as the old butler alfred . it 's hard to believe gough was a villain in so many horror movies over the years . i assumed michael caine 's alfred would n't compare to gough 's , but i was wrong - they 're both great . pat hingle was really good ( as commissioner gordon ) in this movie . hingle and gough were in all four movies of the original series , and i enjoyed them both in batman returns . but in batman forever i did n't like them nearly as much , and in batman robin i found their characters annoying as hell . vicki vale 's ( kim basinger ) investigation into bruce wayne 's background is completely uninteresting . but i already knew what she would find out , so maybe that 's why i did n't like those scenes . i also found the vicki character annoying , screaming in terror every three seconds she was onscreen . there 's lots of little things i love in this movie . the sight of batman rising off the ground after the two muggers shoot him , ( and the terrified expression of the gunmen ) with elfman 's dramatic music blaring . the look on napier 's face when he sees the emptied safe . when the guy got fried by the joker 's joy-buzzer ( one of the worst deaths i 've ever seen in a movie ) . when the mimes close in on the press conference and unleash a surprise , and the joker 's speech right before a mob boss dies . the first action news report of the movie . the way `` urgent '' is written in messy crayon on the parcel . when batman jumps through the skylight ( accompanied by elfman 's music ) . the design of the batmobile - minor changes make the car even cooler in batman returns . when the batmobile speeds toward the batcave ( again , elfman 's music is awesome ) . the grin on the young jack napier . the batmobile attacking the chemical factory . the joker 's facial expressions when he speaks in the microphone right after throwing lots of money to the crowd . when the bat signal is lit - but it 's not as awesome as the first time it 's lit in batman returns , or when it 's lit at the end of mask of the phantasm . and now a few complaints . this movie featured too many songs by prince . after a while , they get unbearably annoying . there were lots of other great `80s pop songs that could have ( and should have ) been used in this movie . another thing is the joker seems completely helpless without his goons to back him up . so i found the final showdown at the bell tower a little boring . by the way , you can tell that nicholson 's make-up job would look a lot more realistic in this day and age of filmmaking . burton 's batwing is cooler than schumacher 's batwing ( but not as cool as the one in mask of the phantasm ) . anyway , the targeting system of burton 's batwing seems a little screwed up - batman has a big red target locked on the joker , but the plane 's missiles and machine guns miss their target . and the joker did n't even try to get out of the way ! looks like batman paid the price of designing his own weapon systems . i always overlooked this movie 's flaws ( until i saw batman begins ) for two reasons . first of all , i found keaton 's batman to be so cool and the joker to be so entertaining that i absolutely loved this movie . second of all , the poor quality of the sequels make this movie seem a lot better than it really is . pretty much everytime the joker or the batman are n't onscreen , the movie is boring . but i must say that batman was even cooler in batman returns than he was in this movie - and nastier .

0	why did they even bother transferring this movie to dvd ? seriously ? the [ ... ] child of a masterpiece , `` the vanishing '' sports some of the most half-hearted performances and sometimes downright hilarious performances of the 90 's . this is n't a matter of comparison . this movie , all by itself , just sucks . if i had n't seen the original i 'd just think , `` what a brilliant plot , too bad they decided to bury it ( no pun intended ) with everything else in the movie '' . jeff bridges manages an unintentional bust a gut type performance as the sociopathic professor ; his accent is so forced and ridiculous that one wonders occasionally if this a parody of that great , gut wrenchingly disturbing , hitchcockian 1988 movie . sandra bullock and kiefer sutherland are themselves , which add nothing to the movie . and the ending . oh , the ending . we 've been cheated . totally cheated . all the power that this clunker might have had is torn away in a fervor of `` it has to be upbeat ! '' hollywood cornball syndrome . sandra bullock is rescued , the villain is hit with a shovel , and everything is a-ok ! even though kiefer sutherland 's original girlfriend has been buried alive and suffocated . this is [ ... ] of a great movie .

0	after viewing the avengers with emma peel , which i do every evening after the dreadful news , enjoying repeats and repeats as well , with reluctance i played the hospital dvd . i thought it was terrible . the diagogue idiotic . i could not help but laugh when scott attacked diana . emma peel would have thrown him across the room . i had to play a few episodes of emma peel in the avengers series to cleanse me of this disappointing and terrible hospital dvd . the lovely diana rigg is a great actress and an extremely intelligent woman , and i was saddened that diana after all those wonderful and exciting avengers collection , with her unrivaled beauty and possessing the most beautiful voice and able to do her own stunts took on this dismal role in the hospital dvd . i see that this dvd was dated 1971 , this was only 4 years after her last avenger episodes dated 1967 . in hospital , i believe she was 33 years old . oh well , i will cleanse myself of this hospital dvd and devote an eveningr to a few episodes of the avengers with the lovely diana rigg as emma peel . finall , john steed would have been shocked to see how emma reacted to george scott the doctor . can you imagdine if john steed appeared in the hospital dvd to collect diana rigg and ride off into the sunset as they do after an avenger episode . perhaps they will issue hospital 11 , and bringr in john steed and a few other great actors of that series . robert lyons reno , nevad
1	hollywood make them , then they break them -- stars can fall as fast as they rise . sometimes they rise again , and sometimes they disappear . and christopher guest casts a jaded eye on the fickle ups and downs of hollywood in `` the big picture , '' a quirky , cynical movie which focuses on what the successful should never let go of . it has a few awkward stretches , but overall it 's a darkly witty cult comedy ( `` you 're tracking failure all over my carpet ! '' ) . nick chapman ( kevin bacon ) is the winner at an arty student movie competition , and instantly agents are chasing him all over l.a . in no time , he 's the rising young director , with a movie deal at a major movie corporation . but he 's also starting to lose sight of his old life , as he tries to become a major success . he changes the style , plot and characters of his arty movie for demographics , turning it into a beach bums/naked ghost movie . he dumps his pretty girlfriend ( emily longstreth ) for a bimbo actress ( teri hatcher ) . when the studio head gets dropped , nick falls as quickly as he rose . but a chance encounter with an old pal gives him a second chance -- an arty music video . this time , can he get it right ? christopher guest is best known for his brilliant mockumentaries , tackling everything from small-town musicals to folk festivals . his forthcoming one is another one about showbiz . but his talents are just as present in a `` typical '' movie , and guest does a smart , quirky job of it . the lesson : be true to yourself and your art , do n't fall for empty glitz , and do n't let success go to your head if you 're lucky enough to get it . the story is a pretty straightforward one -- nick gets great success , it goes to his head , he falls , and he rises again a wiser man . and the movie falls into straightforward lines , without many unpredictable plot twists . at first glance , it does n't seem that unusual . what makes it special ? well , simply put , guest manages to infuse it with his unique type of wit , like the oddballish pez music video and the noir fantasies of nick 's life . not to mention the glorious dialogue . when speaking of nick 's one'n'only music video , a studio woman announces , `` it 's the best one yet , and i 've seen 'em all ! '' and guest manages to show us agents , artists , students , directors and actors , but never descended to cliches . they 're real people , no matter how nasty . and bacon does a solid job as a young man who learns how empty glitz is . his best scene is the reunion with his friend emmet , where he confesses , `` i wan na be your friend again . '' and he 's backed by good performances by longstreth , michael mckean and a dancing jennifer jason leigh . `` big picture '' treads where many movies have gone before , but it does so with an approach as fresh as a pez people music video . a must-see

0	therese , lux , mary , bonnie and cecilia make up the five lisbon girls , ages 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 and 17 . cecilia , the youngest , lives in her sisters shadows because they are all older and of much more interest to their male neighbors . as a cry for help , she slits her wrists and lays down in the bathtub , she survived the incident . after a psychiatrist highly impresses upon the strict mr. and mrs. lisbon that it would be benificial for cecilia to be exposed to environments which have boys her own age , mr. and mrs. lisbon decide to allow the girls to throw the one and only lisbon party . some of the neighborhood 's boys are invited over and while the party is in session , cecilia is pretty inanimate , sitting on the couch while her sisters flirt , talk and laugh . midway through the party , cecilia asks to be excused and mrs. lisbon - though somewhat reluctantly - allows it . cecilia goes up to her room ( on the second floor of a two-story house ) and jumps out the window , landing on the spiked fence on the front lawn of the lisbon house . in this way , cecilia lisbon commited suicide . only four girls remain . the act which cecilia committed did not go at all unnoticed . the father saw her immediately , the party ended there and all of the boys went home rather glum . four of the lisbon 's neighbors , four young boys , suffered a rapidly growing obsession with the lisbon girls , who were beautiful and a total mystery to the outside world . they got hold of cecilia 's diary and tried to explain why she committed suicide . the eldest decided cecilia was a dreamer , and she did not think she would fall when she jumped out her window , she thought she would fly . with their youngest sister gone , the remaining lisbon girls grow closer to each other , stranding themselves further from the outside world . when school starts again , they attempt to go on acting as if nothing happened , not ever mentioning their youngest sister . the run-of-the-mill awkward act is taken part by the rest of the school however . the usual profuse apology to the mention of the word `` death '' and the like . trip fontaine is the most popular guy in school , the object of desire to all of the girls at school ... except for the lisbon girls , which is of no importance to trip until he sets eyes on lux . trip can not help but be enchanted by her flawless beauty . in the beginning , he is unsuccessful in his quest to even catch her attention for she bluntly shows she 's not interested . but after his consistent courtship , lux falls for his charming ways . trip then attempts to convince mr. lisbon to let him and three of his football team pals take the lisbon daughters to homecoming . after mr. lisbon talks to his wife , he agrees to trip 's request , knowing nothing but trip 's sincerity and claimed honorable intentions , on the understanding that trip have all of the lisbon girls returned to the house by curfew . after trip explains the situation to his football peers , he gives in to those who bribe him the most handsomely . meanwhile , the lisbon girls are picking out fabric for the dresses they shall wear to the homecoming dance . though one pattern is used for all four dresses , each dress looks unique when concentrating on detail . once they pick up the girls , they stop midway to the homecoming in order to smoke , lux being the only girl volunteering to smoke . they then drive to the dance . trip and lux sneak away and sneak swallows of alcohol . another one of the lisbon sisters and her date follow , but leave soon afterwards , not being as wild nor daring as trip and lux . at the time they all decided to meet back at the car so they could make the girls curfew , they are all there ... except for trip and lux , who at that time were alone in the middle of the football stadium field . deciding they must make their own curfews , therese , bonnie , mary and their dates leave without them . after fooling around , the intoxicated trip and lux fall asleep in the middle of the football stadium . trip awakens in the middle of the night and leaves lux there alone . when lux wakes up early the next morning she is confused as to why trip is not there . she takes a taxi home and her parents were worried sick ( of course ) . but they take measures as far as pulling the girls out of school and stranding them inside the lisbon residence . the girls , in a desperate attempt to hold onto a connection to the outside world , begin using morse code to interact with the four boys who so closely follow their lives . one of which boys lived across the street and the rest which came over daily after this in order to contact the girls . soon following , the boys begin talking to the lisbon girls via phone . one day , the girls invite the boys to come over once mr. and mrs. lisbon are asleep . the plan being that the boys were to drive the girls somewhere , the boys hastily agree . they sneak over and lux invites them to wait inside for her sisters and lux goes to wait in the car . the boys wander down to the basement while waiting for therese , bonnie and mary , verbally expressing their hopes for the night . but then they realize they have stumbled upon one of the sisters . she had hung herself . the boys , scared to death , run all the way home . time passed , things changed , girls came and went ... but no matter what , those four boys never forgot the lisbon suicides . ultimately , the movie was nothing short of queer . when trying to sum up the story in a few lines ( such as `` follow the lives of the lisbon sisters and how they connect to their neighbors . a story full of obsession , gossip , lust , love , desire and isolation . '' ) the story sounds quite unique and intriguing , but the story fell short of that for me personally . partly because the lisbon sisters really committed suicide for a reason not much deeper than isolation . the movie , in places , is also extremely flawed . i do not believe mr. and mrs. lisbon could 've removed their daughters from school for so long without their daughters being taken from them by social services . in many parts of the movie , they should 've used upbeat music to fill the deafening silences . the whole movie was filmed in a style that i can truthfully say makes me rather bored . i would only suggest this film to , perhaps , people who like movies such as `` elizabethtown '' which kirsten dunst is also in . but i personally disliked this movie which was not very tasteful and will not be watching it again in the future
0	first off , robert deniro as the monster . i saw him and immediately thought of jake lamotta or vito corleone . they did n't even try to disguise his accent and no-one ever explains why the monster sounds like he just got off the plane from new york . second , kenneth brannagh was so in love with the set that he forgot about story . finally the scene where elizabeth was ressurected was ridiculous . frankenstien 's shock that she 's not happy to be back -- burnt up , cut of and her heart pulled out of her chest -- was supposed to be touching but i laughed . we all know how great kenneth brannagh is but he got completely carried away here and the result was really , really , really bad . i give it two stars for the pretty costumes and utter magnificence of aidan quinn 's face .
0	seriously , i am an expert , and this movie sucks . but , imagine for a moment -- yes , stop and withdraw from your metaphysical prejudices -- a movie whose premise is truly profound , strikingly engaging , and culturally challenging -- that art is only such relative to those individuals , those `experts ' , whose tastes , likes and dislikes , decide it so . given that aesthetic claims are empirically nonsensical -- a matter of pure subjective opinion -- why is it that some art is valued at all while some not at all ? besides this interesting question , which is put forth explicitly , without the pretentious riddles of terrible poetry , and in about 60 seconds , the rest of the movie is obnoxious editing and narration . avoid at all costs .
1	this is a showcase of jet li 's brand of martial arts ... fast and furious . while this is no fist of legend the movie has enough action to keep the exitement going . what i did'nt anticipate was the humor . absolutely lots of laughs to pick up where the action stops . once persons are prepared to judge this movie on it 's own merit they will see that this movie was worth buying
1	while the dubbing may be a little annoying , i still love this movie . the fight scenes are great and the movie is pretty funny at times . driving motorcycles over cars will always be cool in my book . do n't expect the deepest movie in the world , but do expect a quality martial arts film
0	eddie murphy is a comical guy , but is he really the right guy to play in something as stupid as this ? of course , who is the right guy for it ? one of the questions i ca n't stand to think about in this movie , is how dolittle hears the animals speak , but their lips move and nobody notices . ca n't they connect the dots ? obviously not . and obviously , the filmmakers could n't either
1	my little boy who is 8 years old loves this movie . he goes around acting like the characters from the movie ! he really likes harold and keeps watching the movie over and over again hoping for a different ending . he is also convinced that they should make a midnight madness 2 and let harold win the next time ! this is a great movie , with a young michael j . fox in it , and has no sex or violence and is a very kid friendly movie
1	this is a great movie and i got it sent to me in a reasonable time and it was a wonderful service thank you very much
1	backing up the review that pointed out m. night shyamalan 's earlier films the other movie is titled praying with anger ( also did screen play for stuart little ) . all three movies in the box set are great and worth watching again and again
0	the unbearable lightness of being was considered an unfilmable novel for a good reason : the point of kundera 's writing is not his plot - or even his characters - but his style . for instances , his endless digressions about history , politics , and philosophy . for the movie , we are left with nothing but plot and character . ok , what is one to do ? that in itself would n't be so bad if i did n't watch the film with the constant thought : i could read the book in less time than it takes me to watch this movie . this is a slow film . it takes an hour-and-a-half story and takes three hours to tell it . i ca n't recommend the film
1	this original version is much funnier than u.s. version . the humor is dry and intelligent , and the characters are very complex : at times , you feel sorry for them ; other times , you love them and laugh with them ; and mostly , you think they 're idiots . what a talented group of actors and comedians to create such a complexity of emotion in an audience . it 's not often i can watch a dvd or series over and over , but this is one that i 've enjoyed each time
1	... but the movie was pretty good . i found myself highly disappointed in the book , and almost was n't able to finish it . the characters were flat , the story reading like a history lesson in religion through the ages , and not a true story , so i was n't sure what to make of the movie . i was pleasantly surprised though , to enjoy the movie immensely . it was long , but it kept the pace going throughout . the subtitling in the latin and french was a bit mundane to drudge through , but it made the movie a bit more 'believable ' than everyone speaking english when the main character is actually french . teabing was played brilliantly , and while hanks was not who i would have thought for langdon , he did a superb job in the role . if you can set your personal beliefs aside and view the movie as a piece of exceptional fiction drama and suspense , it is well worth watching . murder , mystery , suspense , action , drama ... it 's all there in this film
1	i bought this as a christmas gift for someone . it came in the mail very quickly , i had no problems with it , and the person i gave it to loved it
1	the thesis of guns , germs and steel gives the most logical explanation for the inequality in development in the world today . not based on one group of people being inherently smarter than other groups , but based on a group of people favored by their environment and other factors ... ..very interesting theory that should be given more study .
0	this edition of the film sucks and sucks again . the wide screen version of this is a masterpiece - without the widescreen ratio this edition can not be true to the comic book sensibility that bava intended . each shot was carefully composed ( and not intended to be butchered ) - this edition is a travesty -- especially when it 's purported to be put out by fans - do you 're homework . there are also scenes missing from this print , scenes that are important and add to the overall ambience . hey i thought the folks behind this were enthusiasts -- instead its just sloppy and self indulgent . look for the earlier laser disc edition ... ... ... .. as for the extras do we really need the - it 's great because i used it in my video slop ... . and it 's great because i did a bad homage/rip-off slop . the documentary in the extras takes great pains to point out that this film was intended to look like a comic book and that 's what was great about it . then when you watch the film what you get is less than a third of the original image ! strikes me a total scumminess . all in a all a fabulous opportunity wasted ... by a few lazy lard-asses with a quick-fix mentality .
1	i thought the video was well done . it was good to feature the clinching games of the division and league championship series plus all four games of the world sries . i think they should have included at least the high- lights on a extra disk of games 1 and 2 of the division series against boston and games 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 of the league championship series against los angeles . still , i highly recommend this collection for all gung-ho white sox fans who cherish the memory of the most exciting season in 88 years . a great viewing companion for those cold winter nights
0	every lakers fan i 've ever met lives in the past sadly now . to them , the clock stopped when kareem and magic hung up the shoes [ and we know why magic had to leave ] . their basketball knowledge from the 60s to the 90s is rewarding . after this , however , they do n't have a clue of what has happened to this once mighty and moral organization . the lakers have been a good team over the decades [ as apparent on this dvd set ] , but the run of greatness is coming to a long slide with kobe driving the bus . the lakers were once considered the green bay packers of the nfl , but now they 're just lucky to even get close to a playoff spot over a majority of the teams in the western conference which are much better than the present lakers . i recently attended a game last fall at the staples center , and besides all of the celebs eating hummus in the stands , i could barely hear myself think over phil jackson 's mantra `` i told you so . '' further illustrating how things have changed in la , jack nicholson has become embarrassed to wear anything purple or yellow . so it is understandable that laker fans would rather focus on the achievements of magic and kareem , than rather extol the diminishing skills of kobe since his colorado folly . there are some good games on this dvd along with great moments from the baylor , chamberlain , west days . i recommend any laker fan to purchase this dvd set to relive the past . so laker fans , keep living in the past if you so desire . maybe kobe will retire and become a man of the cloth and lead the lakers to the nba championship promised land once again . long live the forum [ or the staple remover center ] or whatever they are calling the lakers home now
1	i normally do not enjoy movies about the making of movies , so i was very pleasantly surprised to be thoroughly entertained by 'living in oblivion ' . the reason i took the chance at all was due to the presence of catherine keener , one of our most overlooked and under-appreciated hollywood actresses . she once again did not disappoint , but the entire cast was extremely good . you get a real education on the frustrations and challenges involved with making a low budget film . buscemi is also right on target as the stessed out director . the amazon reviews are for the most part positive about this film and for good reason . i 'm glad to join my fellow amazonians in heaping praise on this low budget gem
1	after i watched this sequel i realized it was not as good as the first but i did enjoy it .
0	three discs , includes one insert per disc with episode info . what 's on it 15 30 minute episodes three episodes from series 2 : municipal election ( 2-6 ) , 30th anniversary ( 2-11 ) , and on the waterfront again ( 2-19 ) twelve episodes from series 3 : thursday night ( 3-2 ) , my factory my self ( 3-4 ) , death motel ( 3-5 ) , play it again bob ( 3-7 ) , gaslight ( 3-8 ) , sammy maudlin ( 3-11 ) , hollywood salutes its extras ( 3-14 ) , irwin allen show ( 3-15 ) , big brother ( 3-16 ) , two way tv ( 3-17 ) , midnight express special ( 3-19 ) , and dick cavett ( 3-24 ) extras commentary : joe flaherty and robin duke , andrew alexander featurette : looking back with andrea martin featurette : the mackenzie brothers : take off , eh ( cbc the journal profile ) featurette : sctv at the firehall changes 1 election : 2 30th anniversary : 3 on the waterfront : 4 thursday night : closing credits music changed to season 4 generic theme ( obscuring cronkite 's rambling monologue ) 5 my factory : 6 death motel : edna hymbecker no longer sings killing me softly 7 play it again , bob : closing credits music changed to season 4 generic theme 8 gaslight : 9 sammy maudlin : 10 hollywood salutes : star wars title music in sneak previews has been replaced ; hawaii 5-o theme music in hawaii 5-ho has been replaced ; closing credits music changed to season 4 generic theme 11 irwin allen : 12 big brother : 13 two way tv : the cruisin ' gourmet has been replaced with tex and edna boil from 3-6 ( the lone ranger show ) 14 midnight express special : randy newman 's `` pants '' has been replaced by generic music 15 dick cavett : love boat deer hunter promo is cut
1	this is a great dvd for all collections even if the movie stank which it did not . the package is worth the coin .
1	i liked this movie when i first saw it and i seen it about 10 times ... i like to watch any movie that involves gangs ( especially bloods crips ) so i can learn from them ... if you 're looking or are just a collector like me of gang movies ... you may not want this one in your collection ... becuase to me , it does n't show enough bloods crips in it ... . the characters are fictional ... .there are some minor gangs in it as well called the white fences ( latino/hispanic gang - i 've never heard of this gang , so i do n't know if they are true or not. ) . the actors who play the gang members of the white fences are good actors though ... i think they are better then don cheadle and wayans who play crip members ... this movie centers more on white fence and their rivalry w/ crips ... there 's not too much focus on bloods in here ... it also more focuses on sean penn 's character and robert duvall too ( good cop/bad cop ) , and penn on how he falls in love w/ a former gangmember woman in the white fence gang . colors is a good watch ... i just wish it had more gang focus in it ... and more gang sets ( chapters , i.e . eight tray gangsters , hoover , etc ... ) if you 're looking for a good gang buy , buy the book `` monster '' by sanyika shakur a.k.a . monster kody scott , or `` do or die '' by leon bing . those 2 books far surpasses this movie..
0	im sure ill here alot from this review but everyone giving this movie 5 stars i dont see how or why.have you people just been introduced to the movie world ? this movie is awful between the bad acting and the annoying music playing during talking scenes its flat out frustrating.rusty james brother in this movie acts like a mental case for you peole that havent seen this he dies in the end ( i just saved you an hour and a half of your life cause now you wont have to waste it on this crappy movie ) .between the bad music the bad acting and the plot/storyline going all over the place in this movie its seriously like being on a bad acid trip.what a waste of money and time on this one.ill donate mine to goodwill or the garbage can..not worthy of my movie collection
0	denzel washington is probably my favorite actor . even in that dog of a movie called the manchurian candidate , he shone . tom hanks ? well , lem me quit hating the guy . this is a well-intentioned movie , tom did a creditable job , and we had extreme close-ups with funny colors to camouflage the spots where he overreached . i was also pleasantly surprised to see antonio banderas fly in the face of his latino studliness by playing a gay guy . a passionate one , though , since he 's still a latino , after all . actually , this is a hollywood `` message movie , '' and you know what that means . it 's about as subtle as michael moore . those who agree with the message flock to be beaten about the head by it for two hours . those who the filmmakers would like to see the movie , those who do n't agree with the message , stay as far away from it as possible . there 's a scene in the library where nobody wants to sit at the table with aids boy . the way they stared at him reminded me of `` lao wei in china '' experiences . denzel 's character was reminded of segregation , even though he 's too young to remember it , and started to care about tom hanks ' character . aids discrimination is bad . actually , any discrimination at all is bad . and that 's the movie 's message . i agree with the message , but still . that 's all we 've got . as a totally irrelevant non-sequiter , if the name `` sam francisco '' means anything to you , you 've seen subtle commentary on discrimination . i love a great courtroom drama . this one was merely good . with so much of an agenda to squeeze into a two-hour film , they had to take a few shortcuts here . sad , ai n't it ? but even so , a well-intentioned film that i 'm glad i saw . once . not twice . once is enough , thank you .
0	i was fortunate not to spend any money specifically on this movie . i could n't get past the first 15 minutes ... incoherent beginning , and overly stylized particularly where ashe becomes `` the avenger '' ( for lack of a better name ) . nothing like the original at all , which i love by comparison
1	the transfers of the 5 movies found here are worth every penny ! we grew up watching these on philadelphia 's channel 17 with show host dr . shock and the creature double features back in the mid 70 's . the pictures were always so dark and grainy , well not anymore folks ! universal has done an amazing job on the picture clean-up and sound restoration ! bright and crystal clear along with wonderful sound ! also a very nice fold out dvd holder ! the theatrical trailers were transferred in their original release condition which will allow you to compare how good of a job was done on the restoring of the movies to dvd ! do n't wait to long in purchasing your set at a cheap price , they have already disappeared off of store shelves in our area !
0	i was disappointed in this video . i came to it not as a devout catholic but as a fan of travel videos . in other words , i watched this video with the same motivation i would have to watch shackleton 's antarctic exploration , or something from the globe trekker series . with that in mind , the target audience for this video is not me . it is the religious catholic . therefore , from my perspective , i ca n't recommend it . i 'm not one for all the pomp and circumstance of religion . i do n't enjoy worshipping the `` holy father '' , or watching the construction of the clownish uniform of the swiss guard . if you are a devout catholic you will probably enjoy this video . if you are not , and just came to the video because you wanted a globe trekker style tour of the vatican , you are likely to be disappointed . and that is what these reviews are for - to let you know whether you will enjoy the video or not
1	i have been following the laughing man fansubs , so i 've covered all this material before . i 'm acquiring the dvds as they come out to have legit copies . the desc says 2 collectibles toys , it 's actually 3 . there is batou on the plate like motoko from vol 3 . in fact , the base plates fit together , which makes me belive that vol 5 will have another piece that will fit together to complete a composite set . the other two toys are the chinese assassin with the gun-arm and the old robot unit from the organ-farming business ( with the fake southern accent ) . these are easier to put together , i had problems with the tachikoma from the last set , it broke when i tried to put the legs on . have n't gotten around to the super-glue session yet . the product itself : stand alone complex - 2nd gig continues some of the best animation and smartest television ever produced . buy it , share it with those persons worthy/capable of appreciating it
1	the direction was a grade acting top class and to top it you had eric and clint eastwood .eric fleming was mindblowing .one has yet to come across an actor with his confidence class and authority .yes i agree we always tend to focus on clint forgetting that it was eric who was mile ahead of him.todays generation has to watch these episodes in black and white to understand the beauty of this great western.yes the fact is without rawhide there would be no clint eastwood
1	this movie is funny and by being so bold in so many ways is refreshing . it presents realistic characters without worrying about offending people by presenting sterotypes . it takes the time to develope the story effectively without boring the audience . it is a long movie but it moves at a great and effective pace . it is full of laughs . joe pesci is one of the best comic actors of all time . i do n't think that anyone else could have pulled of the part of vinny nearly as well . marisa was great as well and it was hard to find a performance that was less than great . the writing and directing , two things that often get overlooked , was wonderful . the only weakness ? the case is a little fantastic . it is hard to believe the coincidences in the movie that lead to the boys being accused of the crime . of course movie plots do n't have to make perfect sense but this stretches it . though i usually do n't like excessive foul language , this movie uses it in a funny way . i guess it would n't work without it ... but do n't be mistaken ... .it has a lot of bad language . do n't let kids under 17 watch it without supervision
0	saw `` hart 's war '' the other night and could n't really believe anyone would invest money and time in a film as awful as this one . this film bombed at the box office and was yanked from circulation after only a few days . here are ten reasons why : 1 . this film is n't `` the great escape '' and even though he would probably like to think otherwise , bruce willis is n't steve mcqueen . even though willis received top billing , this is a colin farrell vehicle . 2 . the vast majority of the target audience of 18-34 year old moviegoing males could care less about what happened during the reagan administration , much less world war ii . `` hart 's war '' may just as well be a film about a pow camp during the war of 1812 . anything with vin diesel or the rock would be bound to sell more tickets . 3 . as far as depicting life in a pow camp , `` hart 's war '' is pretty much on par with `` hogan 's heroes '' . the germans are nice guys with guns who do n't know very much and everyone gets away with just about anything . where did the gi 's get all those cigarettes , anyway ? 4 . any stalag luft comandant worth his weight in sauerkraut would have just as soon killed the bruce willis character as look at him . as depicted in `` hart 's war '' , the camp commandant ( as portrayed by marcel lures ) would have had a very difficult time maintaining any sort of status as an officer in the german army . his collection of american jazz/blues records is a cute writer 's invention that has nothing to do with the reality of the situation , or of the type of men who were in charge of german pow camps . in reality , the marcel lures character would probably have been relegated to another type of nazi camp with a pink triangle sewn on the front of his tunic . 5 . the storyline is not completely unbelievable - trials did take place in pow camps , one good example being the pow 's who were tried and hung in andersonville ; however , the whole idea that the camp 's commandant would actively participate in such a trial as sort of a jerry springer type advocate is ludicrous . 6 . the idea that during the trial , a group of pow 's who escape go on a secret mission to destroy a nearby munitions factory is insulting . not only did nothing like this ever happen during world war ii , it degrades the bravery of those poor souls whose only act of heroism was to survive internment under harsh and sometimes brutal conditions . the german army simply was n't that stupid . 7 . i saw this film once and did n't like it . i thought that maybe the second time would be better . it was n't . 8 . beyond being sheer hollywood political correctness , `` hart 's war '' seriously misrepresents many of the more important aspects of internment . it ignores the real focus of life in such a stalag which , for most pow 's , was just day to day survival . also , the soldiers who served in our armed forces during world war ii and also happened to be african americans were n't spineless , hapless dopes . 9 . bruce willis playing the same role in variations of `` die hard '' over and over and over again is tiring . 10 . better films about the same sort of subject matter are `` the tuskeegee airmen '' and `` stalag 17 '' . hopefully in a few years , `` hart 's war '' will be completely forgotten , and these dvd 's will be rotting in some landfill .
1	i love this movie it is a `` comfort '' movie for me as this was one of my favs as a kid and i still love it today
1	pro + great story , teriffic acting , beautiful setting con - some pacing flaws , but not enough to destroy the whole lindsay duncan is perfectly cast as the guardian of this endangered photographic archive and liam cunningham is her well-cast , perfunctory foil . as as the story unfolds , the differences between british and american style ( and culture ) are revealed , providing a nice subtext to the plot . one of the viewing pleasures is in discovering that not everything is as it appears , from the central story to the character 's lives . good actors all . but my `` best actor '' award goes to the photographs themselves : the stories they tell and the feelings they evoke are haunting and captivating all at once . a visually rich film
1	these 10 minute workout combos are great for any busy mom since you can do one , two or three depending on how much time you have and how tired you are !
1	the freshman is a very funny movie . the central joke is that marlon brando plays a godfather type figure in lower manhattan who for obvious reasons looks exactly like the titular character brando so famously portrayed . matthew broderick is the freshman , an innocent nyu film student , who through some comedic misadventures gets involved with brando and his `` family '' . the funniest scenes involve a komodo dragon loose in a new jersey shopping mall though the whole film is a delightful comedy . the movie has no real violence and though there are a few mild `` bad '' words the movie is fairly appropriate for viewing by older kids and families .

0	these are not the original theatrical realeases . in addition to the changes made in the special edition versions of the films , american cinematographer noted in their review of the dvd release that they had gone so far as to change the color-timing of the transfer so that the color scheme more closely resembled the more recent prequels . though they are an impressive technical achievement , i 'll be buying the academy award winning films that i saw when i was younger
0	is anyone else having issues with these discs ? when you first place the discs in the player , it skips over the main menus . then the `` menu '' button will only start and stop the episode selected , but it will not return you to the main menu . there is no spanish or portuguese dubbed audio on the discs ( despite what the menus and packaging claim ) and the episodes automatically play with spanish subtitles even when the subtitles are turned `` off . '' the only way to avoid this is to choose `` other '' subtitles with the remote . this appears to be an authoring issue , as i am using a two year-old sony dream system dvd player and have not had these issues with previous seasons . i 'm exchanging my discs immediately , but i have a feeling they might all be bad . anyone else hear about these issues
1	in sanskrit , ayurveda means the study of life . according to ancient hindu texts , all healing systems stem from ayurvedic medicine . this ancient ayurveda series dvd , led by sarah tomlinson with clarity and insight , provides a blueprint for increasing self-awareness through the use of asana , symbol and metaphor . tomlinson , acts like a loving guide to going inward and discovering new self-truths . to effectively bring about change in our bodies and minds , we must change habitual patterns in the body . the poses in the series takes us through a full range of challenging movements , and tomlinson illuminates the wisdom of this practice by brilliantly threading together how the poses evoke certain states of mind and spirit . filmed against a simple , soothing background , tomlinson wisely avoids distracting bells and whistles . instead , the accompanying chanting by ayurveda master gandharva , directly relates to the series in it 's use of each of the planetary mantras . tomlinson 's has a great depth of knowledge about ayurveda , and she weaves many subtle suggestions and information about the benefits of each pose into the practice . this dvd is appropriate for beginner and advanced student : beginners will feel supported and encouraged , as well as exhilirated by the practice , and more experienced students will appreciate the multi-level aspect of tomlinson 's class . l. landau , teacher and student
0	this movie was awfull . supertroopers was awsome and beerfest was even better , so i suppose they can be forgiven for this cinematic abortion
0	this is the first movie i have seen whose rating slipped further the longer it played . `` eight women '' is the story of , well , eight women , who are trapped by a snowstorm -- all 5 inches of it . the man of the house has been murdered in the night . young and old , black and white , of different classes , the women must try to determine who the killer is . `` eight women '' is also a movie about secrets , of which everyone seems to have several . the plot has more twists and turns than an alpine road on the tour de france . yet the first 2/3 of the film is tolerable , funny and even a bit interesting . the characters are self-interested and fun . there 's dotty old grandma , a prissy , hysterical virgin aunt , the dead man 's vampish sister and coltish young maid , two daughters , a somber yet elegant wife ( catherine deneuve ) and a black cook . plenty of class and age tension to make three movies . did i mention the music ? every twenty minutes or so , one of the characters breaks into song . these are always those stereotypical french songs -- full of longing and sadness and references to sleep and springtime -- that are tedious to american ears . and bizarre . while one character sings , the rest do slow little dances . strange . by the 2/3 mark , i was going to give this quirky film 4 stars . but soon , the plot line spun out of control , getting more and more manic until it finally derailed completely with a tragic ending . definitely not recommended unless you are desperate need of a bizarre experience .
1	i watched this dvd in one of my classes and it left me feeling hoplessly hopeless ! i really dont know what to think about the whole presentation . the presence of chomsky makes it look reputable but who knows , he might have been taken out of context although it seemed not . if what they claim about corporations is true , then we are getting ready to implode in one way or another.i 'll keep away from political lines and just suggest that you watch it and decide ... i had given it a rating of 3 but just changed it to 4 . the material is more plausible than otherwise
0	two of the worst stories in the history of tos , but for different reasons . the 'way to eden ' makes the mistake of trying to be trendy , and so dates badly . what the real problem is though is that it makes the enterprise crew seem to be the disapproving establishment , especially of all people captain kirk . 'requiem for methuselah ' is at heart a reasonable story with the assertion that one man could be responsible for the work of da vinci , brahms and others . what it completely fails to do is have any appreciation for kirk 's relationships with women . threre is no way any woman would have kirk obsessed to the point he would fight for her , he is far to full of his own importance for that . this effectively trashes any credibility that the story would have had because this is the crux of the whole episode . a real pity
1	this is the best `` la traviata . '' i was so moved that i had to take a break . it really touched me deeply !
0	i was surprised that so many people childishly attacked the person who gave this movie one-star . someone even accused them of not being young at heart . well , i do n't like this film , and i 'm young at heart ; i 'm just not immature , so try not to confuse the two . some of you need to check your spelling before accusing someone else of bad writing . having said that , on to the film : julie and friends are simply dying to be included in the in-crowd their first year of high school , so on the night julie has a sleepover , they make a deal with some rival girls to go on a `` scavenger '' hunt , which is basically one huge dare game . the group that fulfills the dares first get to be popular by ... ( drumroll , please ) sitting at the popular lunch spot . that is , a picnic bench by the school fountain . that 's right ; popularity is not guaranteed by who you sit with , but where you sit . pick the right spot , and you may just magically become queen bee for the rest of the year . in case you could n't tell by my sarcasm , the shallow impracticality of this film truly bugs me at times . we all know the whole popularity thing is practically a tradition for teen chick-flicks , but this film tended to go over the top with a lot of it . granted , a lot of the exaggerated silliness worked for the film ; in fact , the movie 's beginning surprised me with many clever and well-written clips . however , there is such a thing as going too far . the movie becomes absolutely dedicated to making teen girls look like sassy but fashionably ingenuis bimbos and making teen boys look like ... well , the dumbest , scruffiest beings that ever stumbled on the planet . not that all the boys are like this , mind you ; there are a few of the god-like types that the girls practically kill themselves for . it got worse , however , when the film attempted to fit in a few serious scenes . if the movie had stuck to pure sarcastic silliness the whole time , it might 've worked . instead , the few attempts to be serious usually fell flat on their faces because the seriousness went in the wrong direction . for example , there was the nauseating scene where poor beaten julie nearly gives up her scavenger hunt and one of her friends says , `` julie , i know you can do this ; i believe in you '' in a tone which implies that they 're talking about a major life crisis instead of a juvenile daredevil game . the worst `` serious '' scene , however , is when julie attempts to get into a dance ( therefore fulfilling the final dare ) and the ticket seller wo n't let her in because she does n't have a ticket . suddenly inspired , julie gives the ticket seller a sickening `` i know who you are '' speech , telling her that she knows she was a nerd her whole high school life and that now , because of her former nerdiness , she 's become a poor ticket seller . julie ends her speech by wailing , `` i can see myself being you in four years if i do n't go to this dance ! '' the ticket seller leaps to her feet but , instead of punching julie , suddenly breaks into a smile and says , `` go ahead and go in ! '' um , what ? ? whatever happened to the girls finding out that popularity is n't everything after all and actually getting lives and acting like humans ? ( not to mention that nice sock in the mouth i was hoping julie would get ) . is this what we want to teach our kids , that being dedicated to work makes them nerds and that partying all the time will get them somewhere in life ? i personally think the `` nerds '' are far better off than the girls who lose their virginity on the first date and party all year rather than learn anything . it was this scene and this message that seriously lowered the film in my opinion . i 'm not sure why the filmmakers decided to end the film with this childish message . maybe they did it on a dare because the popular filmmakers finally offered them a cool lunch spot in exchange . i recommend `` never been kissed '' and `` mean girls '' far more than this film ; they have good moral lessons as well as intelligent humor . oh , before i finish , here 's one more valuable lesson from this film : girls , if you want to win a guy who 's never noticed you , all you have to do is strike a cool pose , hop on a skateboard , and ride it directly in front of his car . ( do n't forget to wear an expensive dress and look flawless while you 're at it ) . do this , and he will be so in love with you that he wo n't even care if you tell him that you did something freakish like stealing his underwear . the things we learn from movies , huh ?
0	with so much talent on show here you would expect a lot better movie , but this is another case of the scriptwriters letting the movie down . matthew mcconaughey delivers another good performance , yet does n't stray too far from what he knows best . there is bradley cooper as his best friend who you will remember as rachel mcadams fiance in wedding crashers . patton oswalt appears in a blink and you 'll miss him scene , but the heros of the day are kathy bates and zooey deschanel who 's roles are a lot more important than the characters they play . bates is great as mcconaughey 's mother while zooey is at her sarcastic best as parker 's flatmate . parker should stick to television , she is dreadful and totally unconvincing in her role , maybe if they had cast someone else in her place there may have been a chance for this movie . a good date movie flick , the story is predictable but i would have been willing to look past that had i been entertained . special features are nothing too special . a trailer and a few dodgy featurette 's . a rainy night rental movie
1	this movie is asome its one of my favorites from the 90 's and probably my favorite plot twister/ who done it along with m night shamylans films . this movies great plot is over looked by the average americans craving desire of sex and scandal which is retarded and makes this country alittle less than great . anyway the shear sex appeal is also one of the tones that makes this movies atomasphere so great the music hits it perfect and the 2 leads are my favorite younger actress ' neve campbell and denise richards who are both perfect for they 're rolls . the whole movie is just oozing with sex appeal that combined with the story makes it irresistable . which is unexpected from john mcnaughton as it was his first big claim to fame film . bill murray adds some much needed comic releif and the plot will keep you guessing till the end and will fool anyone even those retards from csi . the 2 girls have `` it '' in theyre rolls they just seem to fit together like a sexy peanut butter and jelly sandwhich . i was fist drawn to this film ever since i meet matt dillon at universal studios he was just asome and i had to see him act , and everyone recommended this movie for that and he was asome in it to . infact i wouldnt mind meeting the whole cast all of them are huge idols of mine and theyre all so cool . i do miss neve campbell.. i wish she 'd come back to films and it looks like she will . so if your looking for a once in a lifetime plot and an asome cast this movie has it or if your like the 99.9 % of people who have seen this and you only like it for the threesome and the pool scenes then i guess its good for that to since ive only seen the editied verison . ps dont waste ur time with the other sequals theyre stupid and repeats of this one with not so famous casts . take a look at the fist still at the bottom it sums up the whole `` it '' thing i was taking about you just feel an incredible amount of `` cool '' form that shoot , well i did anyway
1	english humor is famous for it 's eccentricities but with the exception of selected monty python you need the english pedigree to really like it . the young ones pick up where monty left off . outrageous , yet real , there is a plot line but it does n't get in the way . it 's a shame there were n't more episodes made ... .
0	one of those cases where everything goes wrong in the making of a movie : low budget , unispired performances ( alexis denisof is particularly bad here ) , lack of decent screenplay for the actors to work upon , bad direction , despisable characters , cliched situations ... how kinski chose to act in this one ?
0	there are some good things about this film -- it gives audiences an idea of how insidious the nazi propaganda machine was , for one thing . it also shows the main character , antoine moreau , a ( fictional ) famous french mime , having his eyes opened to the reality of the nazis ' 'final solution ' to the 'jewish problem ' . brought to a czech town that has been 'given to the jews ' by the nazis in order to stage a performance that will be seen by the swiss red cross delegation , hopefully persuading them that the germans are not as monstrous as they have been portrayed , moreau changes his original idea for the performance , hoping to get a 'silent ' message to the red cross that will let them know the true fate of jews ( and other 'undesirables ' ) at the hands of the nazis . i 'll briefly mention a couple of less-than-positive observations , and then get into my main problem with the film . the production values reminded me a bit of a made-for-tv movie -- and from time to time it seemed that the sound was a little out of sync with the picture . the image quality on the dvd could have been much better as well . also , the shanachie dvd release is version of the film that has been dubbed with english . this is , in the case of this film , not very well-done . the cabaret singer , for instance , comes across as completely unbelievable in that her voice does n't match her face or ethnicity in the least . everyone in the film winds up with an english accent , which detracts from any authenticity that might have been retained using subtitles instead of clumsy dubbing . another reviewer below brought up the dubbing problem as it apples to one of one of the children , stella ( portrayed by linda jablonska ) . her voice does not sound at all like that of a little girl . she develops a bit of a crush on antoine , which in itself seems like a pretty natural occurrence under the circumstances -- here is a famous artist who has come to the village to stage a show , with her as one of the leads , who is kind and supportive and friendly to her , who listens to her ideas and feelings with attention and respect . the problem i had was with one scene in particular . stella has been caught on the streets after curfew and chased by police . she bites one of them and manages to elude them by squeezing through a break in a fence . in the process of getting away , she gets muddy , scrapes herself bloody in a few places , and tears her clothing . she goes to moreau 's hotel and climbs to the ledge outside his room and taps on the window . when he opens it , he is shocked at her condition , lets her into the room , and begins to try to clean her cuts and scrapes , asking what had happened . he then draws a bath for her , so she can wash herself . as moreau sits down , still in a bit of a daze over what has happened to her , she steps into the bath . just before she pulls her dress over her head , she says to him , `no looking . ' he shakes his head to bring himself out of his daze and says `of course ' , then repairs to the adjoining bedroom , where he lies down on the bed to have a smoke , allowing her to conduct her bath in privacy . a moment later , he hears a noise and looks up to see stella emerge from the bathroom , completely naked , in a full-frontal nude shot . moreau gets up from the bed and lifts the covers , suggesting that she warm herself . she climbs into the bed ; he covers her up , and steps away to the other side of the room . there is nothing about the scene that implies that anything improper occurred . he has simply offered her care and comfort and sympathy . this shot only lasts a few seconds , but i feel that , regardless of the director 's reasoning for shooting it in the first place , it could have been left out . if the point was to show that moreau has either had morals all along , or that he has acquired them , it could have been demonstrated in a variety of other ways . earlier in the film , stella had witnessed one of her caregivers , semi-nude , in moreau 's hotel room ( stella saw this from outside ) . given her `schoolgirl crush ' on moreau , it seemed natural for her to become upset over this . as a result , however , the scene after the bath comes across as a young girl inappropriately mimicking adult sexual behaviour . this , combined with the `adult ' voice dubbed over stella 's , makes the scene even more disquieting . there are some viewers who might argue that , in europe , `standards ' involving nudity and sexuality are not as reactionary as those in the us . in many instances , i would wholeheartedly agree with them . there is much hypocrisy in the dynamics of american culture and moral values , and not a little bit of neurosis . however , the sexual objectification of children is something about which i feel very strongly ... and i think the scene in question in this film amounts to exactly that . do n't get me wrong -- i 'm not so prudish that i turn away from even full-frontal nudity in a film , if it 's not gratuitous and it 's an integral part of the storyline ... but here , it involves a prepubescent girl , and could have easily been left out . it worries me bit that this point has not been made by other reviewers . have we become so numbed in respect to nudity in films that many ca n't recognize an instance where it 's not only unnecessary , but potentially harmful ? i 'm glad i 've seen the film -- and i 'd recommend it with a bit of praise and some strong reservations , as noted above . with all of the ridiculous claims from some quarters that the holocaust never happened , i think it 's vitally important for films on the subject to be made and seen . the czech film all my loved ones is an excellent film about this horrible time that has not gotten the attention it deserves -- seek it out . n.b . -- this is the second time i have posted this exact review . i noticed today ( 6 april 2006 ) that it has , for some reason , been removed from the site . i 've re-read what i 've written , and i do n't see anything objectionable or offensive . the issues i have with the film are discussed straightforwardly . if anyone objects to anything i 've written here , i 'd like to know what it is .
1	there are n't many films from any era that come close to being `` perfect '' ( though that 's not really the right word ) in just about every way -- probably you could count them on your fingers and have some left over . `` friendly persuasion '' is one of those films -- in spades . directed by william wyler and starring gary cooper , dorothy mcguire , and tony perkins , it is a wonderful , human story about a loving family of quakers ( also known as friends ) living in one of the union-confederate `` border '' states at the time of the civil war in the 1860s . the cast , in small roles and large , is uniformly excellent , none calling attention to themselves but rather becoming their characters and making us understand them . led by beloved , legendary star gary cooper in a great performance as the head of the quaker family jess birdwell , they are marvelous , including child actor richard eyer as feisty `` little jess '' , scrapping with his big sister or partaking in a running feud with `` samantha '' , his mother eliza birdwell 's pet goose , who more than carries her end of the feud with scene-stealing craftiness . there are incidents of family humor and love and occasional disagreements , and a hilarious episode in which eldest son josh ( perkins ) accompanies father jess on a sales trip and is set upon by the scrappy , amorous daughters of one of jess 's customers ( marjorie main ) . we are settled into a lovely , lively exploration of the birdwell family 's idyllic existence . then the war intrudes . josh feels he must volunteer to fight as long as others have to , even though it is against the teachings of his faith . his younger sister loves a young union officer who is soon to go into battle . rebel troops are nearing the region where they live , and no one , including the audience , quite knows what will happen . there is a beautifully honest and dramatic sequence in which young josh gets his first taste of battle , which perkins performs with heartbreaking realism . i recall my father , a world war ii veteran , saying that this scene was the most realistic depiction of a young man 's first time in battle that he had ever seen in the movies . when it is all over and the birdwells return to their quiet , hard-working , loving life as a family , the music ( dimitri tiomkin 's marvelous score ) swells , the wonderful lyrics to the song `` friendly persuasion '' are sung sweetly by the young pat boone , and you realize you have spent two wonderful hours with these genuinely fine , completely human characters in ordinary life and in challenging times . the story has been told with integrity , honesty , humanity , gentle humor , kind restraint and , yes , love -- all of these also attributes of the birdwell family that we have come to know . that is the `` genius '' of this film . along with a very few others , it shows us who we are , who we can be , and how we can live , all with a grace and humility that is almost poetic . and the film never , ever loses its balance . it 's just a great and good movie . i 've seen it almost a dozen times , and it can still move me to tears . i 'm betting it could be released today , amid the ridiculously over-budgeted , badly executed films that rely too much on computer effects and star charisma , and that it would clean up at the box office . the term `` family values '' has been kicked around a lot lately , and nobody quite seems to know what is really meant by it . watch this truly beautiful film and you 'll get a pretty good idea of the genuine meaning of those words .
1	this is another superbly done documentary from the award winning pbs investigative journalism series frontline ( peabody award , emmy and many more ! ) . disregard what one reviewer said about this being pro-walmart propaganda paid for by the corporation . he 's obviously smoking something , because this is made and hosted by hedrick smith , a pulitzer prize winning journalist who used to write for the ny times . he is one of america 's most respected journalists . i started watching the show since i was in high school ( i 'm now late 20 's ) and their shows are exceptionally high quality . now , if frontline is interviewing people who lost jobs and showing rubbermaid factory equipment being auctioned off because they got put out of business by walmart , how is this pro-walmart ? the story starts in america and its impact on the us economy . he interviews some professors , economists , managers , suppliers , and executives . then the story moves to china and hk , and then back to the us . there are some very clear insights from nmost of the people interviewed especially from one professor who talks about the shift in american culture and business history . is walmart good for america ? i ca n't answer that and neither can frontline . this documentary does an excellent job presenting facts without judgement and presents both sides and the complex shades in the middle . it asks some thought provoking questions . the us trade deficit is getting worse every day . quality is going up ( some `` made in china '' stuff is now very good and getting exponentially better every year ) , and that 's really scary for us in america . who 's the blame ? well , all of us . we 're not competing well in the global economy , and we want the cheapest goods . we 're not willing to put our money where our mouth is . if you 're interested in economics , history , social issues , this is a must see . if you care about the american economy , and global events , you should watch this documentary . it 's loads better than the `` walmart , the high cost of low prices '' film ( which is very one sided and not nearly as well done ) . oh , .. and start learning chinese
1	... that you simply have to see , `` mrs miniver '' being one , a little known film dealing with a fictitious german invasion to a sweet english village , `` went the day well ? '' and this film . why so ? because all 3 were made at the start of the war ( early 40 's ) when england stood very much alone in the fight agaisnt hitler and aggresive facism . invasion fears were rife , the war effort looked hopeless at times as in europe , hitler opposing country after country fell to the german aggressors ( not to mention the rampage going on in africa at the hands of rommel aided by the italian forces under mussolini 's instruction ) . england 's small island identity stood alone and under threat and was bombed , starved and demoralised into feeling invasion could happen any day . it was quite possibly the darkest of times in english history and these three films capture the flavour of that dispondancy but equally the might of the will to survive and protect , with realistic perfection . in which we serve does this more personally as we know it is based in truth and the characters become dear and well rounded quite quickly , inspiring us to care about these folk from many walks of british life . for a modern audience it may seem a little over stoic and sentimental at times but place the emotion in context of the year it was made ( 1942 ) , and i guarantee you will view it an aching sense of fear and hope which was precisely coward 's plan . an absolute gem and a must see , i weep every time i watch it
1	many , many years ago when i was a very young woman , i saw my first carry on movie and went to see every one i could possibly get to . then , there were none . several years ago , my sister taped a copy of carry on cleo for me . i could n't believe i still roared at the silliness only the brits can successfully pull off . it must have been fate that led me to look up `` carry on '' on amazon a few months ago . my heart skipped a beat when the carry on collection came up . i instantly made it mine and have watched most movies several times . my personal favorites : carry on constable , carry on cowboy , and carry on cabby . but they are all good . i 've loaned several movies to a brit here in the office who has seen all 27-something of the carry on series and who is now introducing them to his american family . they love them , too . if you love double-entendre done to perfection , do n't miss this collection
1	having drooled over the goodtimes dvd for years now , i did a flip and a half when i saw universal was releasing a widescreen dvd of this superhot love story . i refrained from doing two flips when i remembered it was universal and then saw no mention of special features . what ? look at the potential for bonuses ! there was an alternate ending , there were deleted scenes , how about a featurette ? ! argh ! i just wept and wept . and then months later the release date comes , i tear the dvd open and the movie starts automatically - i hit menu and get the nagging old `` operation prohibited by disc '' usually reserved for fast forwarding through those tired old fbi warnings . there 's not even a menu ! no scene selection . geez . do these corporate monoliths now require movies to be no older than 5 days old to have simple menus ? i 'd like to sit down and analyze the brilliance of sarandon and spader , note how spader 's hair changes near the end because of reshoots , but i 'm just too raving mad at universal right now .

0	i hate lawyers . what is a lawyer , anyway ? basically : it 's a telemarketer in a decent suit , a guy who would be hawking the latest ronco hair-in-a-can super-duper late night special to folks in akron over his plantronic headset , only he won the genetic lottery and got shot out of an upper-middle class womb . shakespeare said it first and best : `` first , let 's kill all the lawyers ! '' . former enron uber-dealmaker john wing put a little fast-times houston spin on that one : `` get all the lawyers in a room -- -and shoot 'em ! -- -in the mouth , so you *can't* miss ! '' exactly . anyway , `` the firm '' is a flick that purports to make the world of high-priced yappers jaw-rippingly exciting , so i was probably all amped up to despise it . but not really : back before i dug into a gig with the dark side in high finance , back when i was hefting a backpack over the sodden campus of my old alma mater , i briefly considered going into law : briefly , for about an hour . it was a desperate time , and i needed money . why did i consider walking hell 's highway , if only for an instant ? because john grisham , boring lawyer-turned-ripping-potboiler-writer-turned-back-into-boring-lawyer , a kind of tom clancy for the paper-pusher and green-eyeshade set , made it all sound pretty damned funky ( and lucrative ! hey , dig that bmw 7 series , baby , beep beep ! ) in his engrossing little novel `` the firm '' : granted , i 've read better prose on the backs of cereal boxes , but it held my attention . i mean , seriously : you 're 19 , and the whole flying out on the corporate lear to grand cayman and switching out briefcases full of cash sounds kinda cool . and strippers , man , plenty of strippers . oh , and did someone mention a bmw ? what 's the difference between a lawyer and a snake ? the snake at least has the decency to hiss before it sinks its fangs into your a** . now it 's true : grisham writes like kim jong il sings , but -- -in `` the firm '' , anyway -- -he was a master craftsman at moving things along at a bristling pace , from the pedestrian -- -hotshot law school whiz kid gets picked up by a memphis white-shoe law firm -- -to the pretty damned atrocious , all while keeping the pressure ratcheted up with a dense , suffocating sense of malice . grisham , like michael crichton , is n't a prose genius : he 's not even mediocre . but he writes for film , and `` the firm '' cried out for cinematic treatment . so it 's baffling that , with all the right stuff -- -tom cruise as winsome lead mitch mcdeere , gene hackman doing his chain-drinking gene hackman thang as the corrupt ( but ultimately worn-out and pathetic ) senior partner , and sydney pollack helming it up -- -that the big-screen treatment of `` the firm '' is such a yawner . talk about contempt of court . pollack takes all that intricately woven little grisham-plot and barfs big ugly chunks of it up on the screen . at its guts , really , `` the firm '' was really nothing more than the big career nightmare : i 've bet the farm on this gig , i 'm getting big money , i 'm working like a fiend , my wife is having trouble remembering my name , and evidently i 'm not doing tax-deals for loaded clients -- -i 'm doing money laundering for the mob . pollack just mangles the whole thing , convolutes the simple , and renders up a flick that will have you checking your watch and yawning . casting is part of the problem : cruise does his thing , running around memphis with his briefcase . hackman drinks a lot and exudes pure armani-clad sleaze : `` the firm '' is all funny-wrinkles when he 's onscreen , but hey , a man can only do so much . jeanne tripplehorn ( cruise 's squeeze ) , who plays lara san giacomo when she 's not playing tripplehorn ( seriously , google the two of 'em : astounding ! ) is a bitter old battleaxe who made me want to stick forks in my eyes . wilford brimley is just plain wrong as the firm 's security chief : too bald , too cracker , too rotund , too silly , too low-end , to do the role justice . holly hunter is even worse : hunter is one of those eighties thangs who got pumped up as something sexy , which is baffling , given that she 's about 3'8 , and has all the sex appeal of an oompah-loompah . it does n't help that she 's a big , ugly southern stereotype , the caricature most denizens of dumpy michigan towns imagine southerners to be . you want her to die : she does n't . pollack wants us to think she 's clever and funny . she is n't . ed harris , i think , is in this movie . so is hal holbrook , which kinda ruins everything , because everytime hal holbrook is in a movie you know you 're dealing with a bunch of friggin ' crooks . anyway , the coup de grace to the stupidity is the entrance , deus ex machina , of paul sorvino ( don morolto -- -what kind of goombah name is dat , anyway ? somebody call tony soprano ! ) , who takes this juggernaut of boredom from the merely stupid to the totally ridiculous . if you wan na see tom cruise running around memphis with his briefcase for two hours , by all means belly up to the bar . otherwise , case dismissed . js
0	just rented this dvd and was quite surprised . normally , i 'm a big george clooney and matt damon fan . however , in this film , their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script , editing , and direction which made this film quite dull to watch . while the idea behind the movie is good , it could have been more entertaing , dramatic , or suspensful . as another reviewer remarked , i was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else . but , i did suffer through to the end , where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging..

0	well , i just got done watching this movie and actually went out of my way to write this review . truthfully , i did n't catch the last 20 or so minutes because i found myself doing other things around the house and could care less about what happend . the trailers and the dvd cover of this movie is very misleading . one would think that they are going to see something from a great genre of horror movies about zombies and a group of people doing whatever it takes to survive . i 'm a big fan of romero movies and loved 28 days later so i thought this movie would be a cool australian take-off . i could n't be more wrong . nothing in the movie makes sense from the start . the entire movie is over the top starting with the actors . everybody has entirely too much dialogue except for the main character who hardly says two words during the entire movie . she looks lost , confused , and out of her league . other characters include a local pilot and his pregnant girlfriend , a `` wacky '' police sgt with his asthmatic partner , the bait tackle clerk who never screams during the entire movie , and our heroin character who won the local beauty contest . the movie takes place in a small town in austrialia somewhere . when meteors strike the earth ( and slam into people ) , it unleashes a germ which causes people to become zombies . our main characters all meet up and try to survive . however , aliens are involved so the story goes from a survival story to beams of light dressed in capes and floating around right in the middle of a big battle . the viewer is left to wonder what 's going on at first , but as the dialogue and story become unbearably bad , you find yourself not caring as the minutes tick by . i honestly could n't tell you much else because it 's just so terrible that i just simply could n't take a minute more . bad acting , bad dialogue , over the top effects , and some of the worst camera work i 've ever seen . this movie apparently took two years to make ... imagine if they only had one ? ? ? another portion of this movie that makes me ill is the bait tackle charater . he shows up out of nowhere and saves the heroin 's life like a bad clint eastwood impression ( with big hat covering his eyes to boot ) . then , he walks away . when he appears again , he 's able to do these matrix style backflips ( digging his `` spurs '' into the wall/ceiling ) and making two pistols jump over his back and land directly into his hands . does this guy ever miss ? what do you think ? he manages to kill about 50 zombies with his two pistols while hanging from the wall upside down . not bad for a bait and tackle salesman living in the backwoods of australia ! if you dig the gore , this one is ok ... but again , wayyyy over the top . i had no idea that one bullet from a .45 could blow someone in half . our characters are so clueless that it actually takes them 3/4 of the movie to figure out how to shoot them in the head . i personally counted several scenes where a character is shooting a police revolver and somehow manages to get 13 shots out of a 6 shooter . someone get nasa on the phone and explain how you can do that because i just do n't get it . the absolutely worst part of this movie , without a doubt , is the music . it never stops ! there 's never a scene without music for some reason ! and it just makes what you 're watching seem absolutely cheesy ! it reminded me of a 1950 's serial/pirate swashbuckling kind of thing with guys swinging on ropes and jumping across a gorge kind of thing . the soundtrack is truly the worst i 've ever heard with extra cheese included . did they use up their budget on the effects ? probably ! i found myself wishing that i could mute the music during the film ! if you 're a fan of good monster / zombie movies , i beg you to pass this one by and keep on moving . it does n't make sense , the story is amazingly weak , the plot is ... well , there is n't one ... you 'll wish you could have your 2 hours back . i know i do ! ! !
1	the quality was good and the stories were also good . i am on the list when the first season comes out . this is like a tease
0	this movie creeped me out and not in a good way . johnny depp is an awesome actor and i usually find him sexy but in this stinker i find him really creepy and gross . maybe it 's the michael jackson-ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face . could they have picked a more horrible look for ww ? it looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10 $ wig and 5 $ clown makup on him ! i love tim burton 's other movies but this one sucked bigtime ! it gives a new perspective on willy wonka but this willy is someone i would keep kids away from . this movie is childish if you 're an adult and pales compared to the original . if you 're a kid it 's way too dark and scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking `` auntie zoe , what does that mean ? '' when are screenwriters going to figure it out ? either write a kids movie or write a grownup movie ! ! ! it 's really hard to do both in the same film . it seems like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and kids , they end up appealing to nobody ! maybe i am biased because i loved the original gene wilder version . i would have been open to seeing a remake if it was good but this movie was dissapointing . it 's amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is hollow with lousy characters . the whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones . the only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because i love depp and burton , if you are not a fan of either , do n't waste your time with this steaming pile of poo !
0	this film is among the worst , most pointless , and most inane garbage that i 've ever had the misfortune to view . contrary to popular belief the alien was not cute he was creepy ! the little boy was extremely annoying , and his relationship with the alien made me ill ! actually it made me more than ill , it was down right disturbing ! his bond with the alien was one of the most freeky thing i have ever had to witness , and the kids family was just obnoixious . by the time the alien go home no one really cares anymore . you are just relieved that the film is finally over . watch it only to say that you 've seen this .
0	one of the worst van damme movies of all time , this one and derailed and replicant and knock off , come of van damme baby , make good ones and have good directors too . this one has van damme after mickey rourke who rourke ends up killing him or he thinks he killed him , then van damme goes to an island of lost dead agents and villians ( corny ) . he escapes retardedly and then goes back to save his wife and his up and coming child ( who van damme and rodman almost indanger the poor kid , bastards ) . van damme gets help from puke and choke rodman and they have awesome adventures and eat lots of candy , no wait , thats what i was thinking and then , no . but there 's some , i said some , good action , but then it dies and sits there . the end with an oiled up shirtless rourke and the tiger lets the suspense and action down . strickly for fans of the movies van damme was crappy in . this is repuked up snot on a seseame seed bu
1	in america is a near perfect movie dealing w/ grief and learning to live again after tragedy . it is also about hope . the characters are engaging and each one is dealing with grief in their own way . they are all trying to find a new life literally in amerca and figuratively w/ in themselves after a variety of tragedies and set backs . the only real downside i can note on this movie is that i would have liked a little more back ground on frankie and mateo but i think the movie tries hard to put you in the midst of these lives without arbitrary flashbacks . besides , a great story the cinematograpy is well suited with its combination of views through a child 's camcorder and closer scenes of the city and family life . i especially liked ths subtle way the camera shows the changing of seasons . if you want to enjoy a good story and a bit of tear jerker thent his is a must see . if for nothing else than the performances of `` mateo '' and young `` kristie . '' just amazing .
1	this is a fine collection for those who have recently discovered early rem as well as those who own rem 's previous irs years video collection : succumbs . the succumbs videos are all here , with some variation , and the additional videos/footage are excellent . very serious fans will want more , but this is better than nothing and worth the price . if you like early rem then you may like : 1 ) end of the day by reivers 2 ) banjos and sunshine by sixty acres 3 ) a life full of farewells by the apartments 4 ) massachusetts by scud mountain boys

0	i wo n't go into the movie itself , as other reviewers have done a more than adequate job of that . suffice to say that i have always enjoyed `` cloak dagger , '' despite the hokiness of some of the scenes ( not to mention the laughable visuals at the end ) . this movie still rates at least 4 stars from me . however , amazon reviews are supposed to cover the entire product , and not just the movie itself . in two words : it stinks . no trailer . no subtitles . no scene selections . no extras of any kind . not even a menu . when you slide the disc in , the movie starts right up . when the movie finishes , it starts over again . if you press the `` menu '' button on your remote , nothing happens . personally , i 'd prefer it if after the movie finished , playback would stop and you 'd go to a scene selection menu . even a still image telling you the movie was over would be better than playback looping back forever . i suppose i should be glad universal even bothered to release this movie on dvd . it 's just disappointing that they obviously did n't put any thought or effort into it
1	dmx stars as the drug dealer king david , who pops up in the streets again after a long absence . rolling into the frame in a player 's classic - a late 70 's stutz blackhawk - king david shrugs his way back into the hard-knock life . he quickly reaps what he sows and , mortally wounded , passes all his worldly goods to paul ( david arquette ) , a scrambling white would-be writer . king david 's estate includes an audio journal of his life , which provides flashbacks and a narrative-within-a-narrative that answers the shaken paul 's curiosity . it 's the highlights of king david 's high life that propel `` alone . '' like all of goines 's heroes , king david is a scourge on the periphery , and the movie dramatizes his corrosive effect on the margins with savvy muscularity . every life he touches he leaves in ruins - a need to deface beauty as a result of self-loathing is implicit , and dmx signals that motivation with sly hostility . to say that king david is the best part he 's ever had is an understatement ; he has never felt the need to inhabit a movie in this way before . i would recomed this to anyone who likes the hip hop lifestyle or music and for anyone who like films with a twist
1	based on the bestselling novels by michael and jeff shaara , `` gods and generals '' and `` gettysburg '' ( based on the elder shaara 's `` the killer angels '' ) are the most excting and emotional civil war epics ever filmed . the battle scenes are the most exciting and realistic civil war battle sequences ever put on screen . the acting is phenomenal , with the likes of jeff daniels , stephen lang , tom berenger , robert duvall , bruce boxleitner , martin sheen , richard jordan , sam elliott and mira sorvino , but to name a few of the fine actors and actresses in these two movies . director ronald f. maxwell has created a masterpiece with his first two films , giving rise to the hope that the last film , `` the last full measure , '' will complete what will hopefully be the best civil war trilogy ever made ! `` gods and generals '' movie/dvd grade : a+ `` gettysburg '' movie/dvd grade : a+ overall grade : a+
1	it is almost ashame that north amercian culture needs bill maher . after all , should n't honest yet entertaining social commentary be a little bit more available then it currently is ? on victory begins at home , maher creates entertainment by basically speaking his mind . maher 's central premise that the war on terrorism can be aided by what people do in the united states really is almost a common sense arguement . yet maher is so uniquely unapologetic about what he says and how he presents it , the commentary and comedy bristle with an energy that few comedians can match . maher does this by not pretending he is n't politically opinated , in fact that is what bases his comedy completely on , the rarity of straight-forward unabashed opinion . on victory begins at home he is more democrat then republican , but he openly sides with neither . instead , he rails at all presenting himself as a full person , neither liberal nor conservative , right-wing or left-wing . the end result is an engaging and unique look at culture that seems unfiltered . there is no spin here , what maher realizes is that no spin is funny in a world full of it . with all the spin that is normally doled out by the news media , political columnists and special interest groups , know wonder we need him so much .
1	do n't discount this film because you are dismayed by tom cruise . this film is excellent and a must see . the symbolism in this film alone makes it worth a look . attempt to ignore good old tom and rekindle your love for him pre-insanity . kubrick rarely gets enough accolades for this movie , as he should
1	my kids really did learn a lot from this movie , i would recommend it when your child is trying to learn to go on the potty
0	the `` fake-news '' tv movie had already be done , and done better , ten years ealier as `` special bulletin '' . where the first movie took its subject , nuclear disarmament and terrorism , seriously , this cheese-fest does n't respect the viewers ' intelligence at all . they pull every heartstring and throw every cheap trick they can think of at the camera . not of it ties together in any coherent way and the `` make love not war '' ending reeks of junior-high-school sophistry
1	it 's just like the hit tv show ! in fact they probably got the idea for the tv show from this movie . actually i thought it was more of a comedy than anything . i saw it on the `` we '' network . it 's worth the price if you feel like buying it .
1	as promised , this product was sent brand new and arrived quicker than expected . my brother loves soccer and thoroughly enjoyed this as a present for christmas
1	dvd # 1 presents a terrific hour-long history of the franchise . it hits both the high- and lowpoints , and indicates why the packers are a national treasure and probably the greatest team in nfl history . lambeau , hutson , lombardi , starr , nitschke , the ice bowl , favre , white , the nine nfl championships , the three super bowls they won ( i , ii , and xxxi ) , and the one they lost ( xxxii ) . the best fans in the league , the smallest venue , the most legendary stadium , and the team 's miraculous survival over 80+ years , in no small part because they are the only pro team in any sport that is entirely owned by their fans . the highpoint , of course , is the 15-minute section entitled `` lombardi '' which encapsulates the green bay career of the nfl 's greatest coach -- but at the end of this dvd about the packers ' heroic ongoing history , you realize that as great as lombardi was , the team is greater still . dvd # 2 was produced earlier in vhs format ( i bought it at the packer pro shop in gb ) and portrays the greatest game in packers history and one of the greatest in nfl history . other reviewers have justly praised its play-by-play reconstruction and modern-day interviews with the participants . yes , kramer was offside -- but luck is a part of any game , and the cowboys had a generous helping of it in the second quarter . like another reviewer , i love the postgame interviews , even the glimpses of green bay in 1967 . the muted colors of the frigid game ( maybe packer jerseys actually were that dark in the 60s -- i see the same thing in footage of other games ) and the elegaic tone of the final interviews give a haunting sense of a world that is now departed .
0	i bought this for the jeffrey dahmer and john wayne gacy documentaries , like i imagine you might . i 'm not disappointed really , i do n't regret buying it in any sense , it 's just that this dvd is n't very good at all . it does n't attempt to make any insight , which is n't something i particularly care for anyway . what each documentary offers is a limited and quite dated view of the serial killers . i ca n't imagine anyone learning something they did n't already know from them . it 's mostly told through pictures when it seems there 's option to use video . the dahmer documentary , made in 1993 , does n't feature anything of interest . there 's no interview with his father or anything , just a voice telling a story over pictures we 've all seen before , with occassional clips of victims ' families in court . the gacy one , made in '96 , is the same . there 's also a program , made in 1997 , on criminal profiling . this look at three farely well known killers whose capture supports profiling . it 's told often with video rather then photos , which is good , but still they 're somewhat boring subjects . the criminal profiler , dahmer , and gacy are all episodes from the a & amp ; e series investigative reports , if you did n't realise . the last program is on charles manson . it 's quite different from the others on the disc . made in 1997 , it originally aired on television as biography : charles manson : journey into evil . i do n't with have any interest in manson , but i guess it 's ok . it features significant interviews with manson and main female members of the family . all programs run for about one hour or more . i would n't reccomend any of them , none are good at all . i might even describe them as terrible , considering what else is out there
1	this disc is pure gold ! featuring a full live performance from their 2004 european tour and tons of classic and backstage footage this is the ultimate stray cats fan collectible ! the concert documented on this disc is so satisfying you would think it was still the early 80 's . they show almost no signs of age and you can tell they pour their heart out into the show . they go through all their classics and then some . whether it 's `` stray cat strut '' `` gene and eddie '' or `` rumble in brighton '' what you see and hear on this disc is flawless . must buy for all music fans , not just fans of the cats
1	i am a dancer . i found the choreography in this movie beautiful , brillient and different . the emotion in it really touched me , and i had actually fallen out of dancing because of many different reasons and this movie really did bring me back to my love of dance . it 's very rare to find dance movie that will offer quite as much as this movie did . not to mention i absolutly adore george de la pena . awsome dancer and he was my favorite character in the movie . i love the fact that every character has something they are working through , no one is exactly perfect . to me , although the acting may not be what every one would call oscar quality , to me , it shows a glimps in to life . how pent up emotions can lead to frustrations that are some times difficult to get through . this movie , to me is well worth the watch . sorry for the ramble .
1	warner herzog 's `` grizzly man '' won the director 's guild award for best feature documentary , but the people who pass out oscars apparently did n't agree . `` grizzly man '' was not among this year 's nominees for best documentary . many of herzog 's narrative films , such as `` fitzcaraldo , '' deal with man 's attempt to challenge the indifference of nature , so `` grizzly man '' is not a departure by any means . herzog 's heroes are often obsessed with accomplishing some mysterious , even bizarre , goal . timothy treadwell 's fixation is on grizzly bears . `` i am one of them , '' he is heard to say . he survived in the wild , accompanied by a video camera , and , on at least one occasion , by a girlfriend. , living among the most dangerous beasts in the world whom he apparently believed he was protecting . `` animals rule , '' he said , fist defiantly pumping in the air . `` timothy conquered . '' treadwell became a minor celebrity during his life , appearing once on david letterman 's cbs show , but he aspired to more . before letting his love of animals consume him , he tried his luck in hollywood . he got an agent , and auditioned for tv and movie roles . he was , he told his parents , second choice for the bartender role on `` cheers '' which went to woody harrelson . missing out on that opportunity left him `` crushed . '' what really drove treadwell ? he reminds me of fey little carson on `` queer eye for the straight guy , '' and as he openly mentions that it 's easier to be gay than straight , i wonder if he was homosexual but unable to deal with his orientation , transferred his love of men to the roughest trade imaginable : grizzly bears . `` i like girls , '' he volunteers , but then he mentions various cruising places - truck stops , men 's rooms - in such a way as to make me think he had personal experience haunting these kinds of homosexual hangouts . he was also an alcoholic . were his wilderness adventures an escape from passions he was emotionally and psychologically unprepared to pursue ? those who are seen offering their remembrances of treadwell never allude to his sexuality . they describe a man whose life is ruled by a naive , hippy , new age approach to nature and who died as a result . the bears , to whom he gave names like `` mr. chocolate '' and `` tabitha , '' need protection , he said , and he was their self-appointed caretaker . others suggest that , despite his good intentions , he did more harm to the animals than he could have imagined . after treadwell was eaten by a bear , the animal was shot and its remains became a feast for other forms of wildlife . shooting a bear because he eats a man is comparable to shooting the customers at kfc for eating chicken . what is a bear supposed to do with a human who invades his turf ? treadwell was an intruder . one mans saystreadwell made the mistake of thinking these were people in bear suits . but treadwll knew these were animals . trouble is , his knowledge of animals seemed to have been learned from disney cartoons . the universe , director herzog says , is ruled by hostility , chaos , and murder . treadwell had a different philosophy . `` is n't that sad ? '' he squeals in his high-pitched girlish voice as he observes a bee who apparently expired while doing `` his pollen thing . '' `` i love that bee , '' he says . partially financed by the discovery channel , `` grizzly man '' is superficially a nature documentary about a man who loved wildlife so much that he felt at home among the bears and wolves more than he did his fellow humans . but it 's also a portrait of a highly disturbed man who admits he was treated for manic depression but rejected medication to control the condition because , he admitted , he needed those soaring highs and crushing lows . he also needed to record his solitary life on video . we see him crying as he pets a wolf , laughing when his command that god make it rain seems to have been obeyed , and arrogantly blasting the humans whom he perceives as the enemy of the animals . what we do not see is his final encounter with the bear that ate him . mercifully , the lens cap was on the camera when he was attacked . the camera was running , though , and treadwell 's screams , and the screams of his girlfriend , were recorded . out of respect for his family , herzog does not let the audience hear these recordings . instead , we see him listening to the audio , and his reaction ( telling one of treadwell 's friends that she must never listen to it , just as she must never see the coroner 's photos of the aftermath of the attack ) , is possibly more effective than including the obviously horrific sounds in the film . `` i had no life , '' treadwell said of his days before he began to frolic with ferocious beasts . `` now i have a life . '' that life is memorialized in herzog 's film . brian w. fairbank
0	dont take me wrong i do love mariah but this movie is not making any sense to me i mean mariah doesnt seem very interest to `` play '' in this movie ! ! ! this movie is all about music music music music music repeating over and over again nothing new nothing has been changed ... come on ! ! ! but then mariah seem to be better in another movie called wisegirls but again i honestly dont think that mariah should be an actress herself i mean i think she is better off to be a singer instead of playing movies . wisegirls she seem like she wanted to have the `` attention '' and `` show-off '' like saying in her mind : `` look at me i am in the movie ! '' i honestly deep in my heart she dont need to be playing in any movies unless she stands up and do her `` work '' with her actions in the movies not like this and wisegirls movies . i feel bad for giving this movie a 1 star but i had to say what 's my opinion about this movie anyways . wisegirls was alittle better than this one !
0	in this film made in uk and luxembourg , madeline stowe stars as senga . senga and her daughter nat are driving at midnight after visiting nat 's father . they bicker the whole trip and it just increases when they stop for a break at a rest stop . nat runs away with a mysterious girl who tries and recruits her into a mysterious cult . and we are left with a nerve wracked mother doing all she hectically can to retrieve her daughter . both the daughter and mother eventually learn that this cult kills people for their blood . why they do so is never explained . and even at this point when senga is trying to rescue nat , she still acts like a brat . the last third of the movie seems to just generate more confusion . and becomes unbelievable and my main reason for the rating i assigned . that good part of the movie has to be attributed to the direction , not the wirtting . the movie is dark and suspenseful . though you do not know what really is transpiring in this movie , it does keep you on the edge of the seat as senga tries to rescue her daughter
0	running with scissors is a slice of life movie which spends time leering into the lives of eccentrics and then ends with no revelations or culminating event . unfortunately what comes before the movie fails to culminate is not very profound or insightful . it is marginally entertaining and somewhat troubling . the lead character in the movie is a 15-year old . his parents divorce , and his selfish mother sends him to live with her charlatan psychoanalyst and his similarly-acquired family . lead is on course to become a writer ( who eventually writes the non-fiction account upon which this movie is based ) , but we see little of his efforts to develop himself as a writer . all the performances were serviceable , save for gwyneth paltrow , who lazily regurgitates a role she played previously . annette benning is also essentially revisiting a role she played in a better movie . mrs. benning performed excellently and selflessly , but the similarity of the roles intruded on my view of the movie . it is a sure sign that hollywood is producing too many dysfunctional family flicks when all actors have been consigned to act in them and some actors are serving a second term . also growing tiresome is the treatment of gays in movies . the presence of one or more characters has become a requirement in films that explore a set of quirky characters . furthermore , the gays are stereotypically endowed with greater passion and depth of emotion , and are put-upon or stifled by the stodgy straights . the most promising characters are the psychoanalyst 's wife and adopted daughter . the movie has some colorful and funny scenes , but these are not enough to justify a viewing
0	the so-called humor in this embarrassingly awful and unfunny movie is so uncreative and moronic . it is apparently for a demographic of viewers with an extremely childish sense of humor . a three year old will laugh at anything . every turn of the plot is stupid . this is in the running for the worst movie ever made . i do n't trust the taste of anyone who actually was impressed by this horse manure . i hope that bruce willis would have the class to turn down a role like this if he was offered it now . i think he is a very good actor . it 's a shame what kind of garbage he had to be in , to get his career going
0	the first time i put this workout dvd on , i expected to see exercises designed for abs , buns and thighs . what i actually saw was an easier version of the kickboxing dvd . i kept going , thinking it would get to the abs , buns and thighs , but it never did ! the other huge problem with this video is that half of it is filmed from the waist up , or headshots only , so when you are being introduced to a new step in the routine , you ca n't even learn it , because you can not see the instructors legs or feet . also very irritating how there are interruptions in filming , picking up on a different beat to where it left off . all in all an awful purchase and not even worth the $ 4.86 paid . i turned it off halfway through the second workout and put billy blanks taebo on instead . much better ! ! !
0	when i 1st watched requiem from the darkness i had high hopes for an anime show i heard that could actually by scary . to my dissappointment this show was not scary at all but a mockery of anything that is anime . this show has good animation is some spots with some deformed shapes of people . the strengths of the show however primarily rely on its soundtrack which is above average but nothing amazing . also the last straw with this show was the horrible depictions of people being graphically murdered . this show is disgusting because of these potrayals a brothers murdering each/husband killing wife after wife/a man who enjoys murder/and very very intense sexual situations of insects and once again family members murdering each other . i recommend this show to no one and i believe geneon has made a mistake licensing it . if you do n't heed my review then you have wasted your money on a dvd not worth a penny ( i would n't take it for free )
1	i loved this dvd set ! grew up watching it..and remember running home after school to catch each days episodes . watching this set transported me back to another time , when things were peaceful and less frazzeled ! stayed up till 2 am watching it all and felt like that little kid from school again ! like many young girls back then i was 'in love ' with tim considine ! so nice to see he and david back talking about it ! i hope disney co. will put out the next 2 series of this great show on dvd soon
1	i worried that the 80s soundtrack would detract from the film 's power as a period piece , but it totally did n't . it was seamless . i will buy this for my home collection . i have always loved kirsten dundst 's work and this is no exception
1	i feel some of the other reviews here are unjust and over exagerated . there were two places in the film that in total lasted maybe about five minutes where the sound was distorted , but not badly since you could still understand the characters clearly ( ex . one area had a warpy vhs noise and the second had a bit of low static ) . the costumes were well selected , but i felt a better job could have been done on the rats and the lizard ( you can see a gap where the costume ends on his face ) . this version follows the book well , though it left out a favorite qoute about the taste of the liquid in the first scene that she drinks from the `` drink me '' bottle . i also felt that the british accents in the movie enhanced the film . i recomend this to fans and people who are n't overly critical of films
1	daniel deronda is george eliot 's 1876 novel dealing with the rise of zionism incarnated in young daniel deronda . sadly but truly this is the first major english novel giving a positive view of the jewish people . deronda is raised by the wealthy sir malinger as an english gentleman . in the course of the long novel and miniseries he learns he is a jew ; meets his mother and is the love object of two fascinating women . mirah lapidoth is the jewish musician who is rescued from suicide by daniel . her love for daniel burgeons as she comes to know and love the kind young man . gwendolyn harleth played by the brilliant acting of romola garai is the spoiled , impecunious husband hunter who weds the rich cad grandcourt only to rue her unwise choice of mates ! she loves deronda as her marriage becomes a torture chamber of psychological combat . like all bbc productions this one is photographed in beautifully rich colors . the scenery is beautiful and the musical score is haunting to the ear . this tale runs about four hours and is a joy.many american viewers may be dismayed at the slow , leisurely pace of british productions . please remember that these productions are based on long english novels which were published in several monthly parts . they are long but they are also wonderful explorations of the human soul . gwendolyn 's story is a bildungsroman in which she grows as a person . ditto for deronda who learns to take pride in his hebrew heritage . this is a worthy bbc production well worth the viewer 's time and money
1	maybe the most engaging documentary ever made . brilliant style is used in telling the story of one of the giants of the movie industry , producer robert evans . giving magical illumination and motion to still pictures in a way that i could only describe as psychedelic . being a film fanatic for the last 43 years i was shocked and ashamed to find that i had not heard of robert evans . in all my reading of credits over the years i had somehow missed his name . i had remembered seeing william castle 's name at the beginning of rosemary 's baby but not evan 's . then , at finding out that he was the driving force behind love story , the godfather , the godfather pt.2 , chinatown and one of my personal favorites the president 's analyst and that he was a big reason why those movies were so good , well i was just dumbfounded . and these are just a fraction of the films he 's produced . of course he did n't start as a producer . he had been in women 's apparel with his brother and accredited their endeavours as the reason why women wear pants today . while lounging around a pool one day he was discovered by norma shearer , lauching his career into show biz . it seems he knows everybody and i mean everybody . after watchng this extraordinary film i called my father to ask him if he had ever heard of this astonishing personality . i queried , `` have you ever heard of robert evans ? '' anxiously awaiting a `` no '' so i could tell him all about this amazing show biz entity . he replied , `` you mean bob evans . '' yes indeed , it seems he knows everybody . my father had come across him in his days as a buyer for macy 's . i asked , `` do you know what he does now ? '' `` he 's some sort of movie director or something now , is n't he . `` , dad answered . i bought him the audiobook . evans narrates both the documentary and the audiobook , both which are drawn from his autobiograghy by the same name . his voice is almost as amazing as his story and probably greatly enabled his prowess . he also lent his voice to the short-lived , hysterically irreverent cartoon series kid notorious that still airs on comedy central . all in all , whether you know evans or not this is a fascinating , beautifully made film about a producer whose achievements are arguably greater than thalberg 's and selznick 's combined . the story of his life and loves is the stuff of legends and it goes on and on . this is a must see for anyone interested in tinseltown . ps : i do n't usually care for the added features but these are worthwhile and the credits to the main part of the documentary are alone worth the price of the disc . what a hoot and more proof that he knows everybody . ask your dad . who knows ?
0	after two decades since watching upstairs downstairs , i rashly decided to buy the whole set ! ! ! ! as i watched the first episodes i realized my memory had played a scurvy trick on me ! the melodrama was a bit vulgar and very predictable ! later episodes of the set improved , but not by much ! it was like watching a biplane that did n't quite make it over the trees at the end of the runway . i hope you wo n't make the same mistake i did
0	i bought this movie for my husband because its one of his faves . when we received it we found out it was a blu ray edition and our dvd player does n't accept blu ray dvd 's . so i basically bought a movie i ca n't watch . it should have been put in the description that this a blu ray edition for those of us who do n't have blu ray compatible dvd players
0	a french saying goes : `` the more things change , the more they stay the same . '' it appears that the `` historical '' epic film of yesteryear is still much like that of today in that `` poetic '' license is taken to the extreme in passing outright lies and fabrications as truth . one of the things that really turned my stomach watching this is d w griffith 's emphasis at least twice during the film that he did not intend to offend any race but wanted to show historical events and yet goes on to portray outright falsehoods as truth . firstly , we all know that this cameron dude did not start the kkk and that this organisation has its roots in indiana and not south carolina . secondly , the kkk is not the defender of the south and there is no need to `` purify '' the race as is portrayed here the exact words used by d w is `` preserve the aryan race . '' modern science , using cutting edge dna research has already proved that we all come from the same african man about 60,000 years ago and so any racial distinctions are not only ethically wrong but factually wrong as well . like it or not , we are all related and separated only by about 2000 generations despite our seemingly outward physical differences and have a common ancestor . some of the portrayals of blacks as alcoholics and white women predators with behaviours more akin to monkeys i found extremely revolting and shocking and leaves me completely unsurprised that riots and lynchings quickly followed the screenings of this movie . yes , this movie may have been the first feature length movie that used a number of novel techniques but does this excuse the content ? this is not akin to an einstein discovering relativity folks ; every single `` good '' thing about this movie would have been `` discovered/invented '' with or without d w. eventually and very probably very soon after . every one of the techniques used would have eventually been used by any of the later , talented directors of the time . the overall lies , attempts to justify racism and the murderous kkk more than make this film fit for the dust bin than for immortality in movie 's great hall of fame . they say that racists are not born but bred ; this is why i 'm not at all surprised at what d w griffith has done here . his father was considered a `` hero '' of the confederate army where he served as a colonel . i 'm sure as a bitter loser of the great war , he must have taught his son his belief system and how to be a great racist . this movie has not been preserved all that well with many scenes being either too bright or too dark and the soundtrack is too loud and it 's quite irritating to have to keep hearing mendelssohn 's overtures over and over again . in conclusion , the question this movie raises is does freedom of expression mean it 's okay to make a mockery of history to further a racist directors ' world view ? also , do you buy the fact that just because this is the first movie that 's longer than an hour mean that this should be revered for all time despite its extremely offensive and destructive message ? like i said before none of the `` techniques '' that this film claims to have `` discovered '' are earth-shattering discoveries that would have required a genius to uncover anyway . so the bottom line is we have here an extremely racist and hate-inducing film that caused a lot more damage than good ; d w griffith 's legacy/mess
1	this is a good 1st season set for the series of criminal intent . i strongly recommend this if you are a fan
1	this box set is worth every penny ! this is an absolute must have if you meet the following eligibility requirements : 1 . you have a decent tv ( at least 32 '' ) and are able to watch in the dark 2 . you have surround/stereo sound 3 . you love 3d ! ! ! ! ! ! i bought this set a few years ago but unfortunately i made a big mistake . i bought the `` horror '' collection- which works- except that the movies are horrible and hard to watch . then a friend of mine turned me on to the three movies in this set recently ( encounter , alien adventure , haunted castle ) and i was simply blown away . now i can not stop watching these 3d movies ! ! the movies are all made by nwave pictures- and boy- have they done a fantastic job ! ! ! ! informative , fun , and of the highest quality ... ..this is the definitive 3d package . kids will love , and so will adults . also , once you have the lcd shutter glasses , they will work on any `` field sequential '' 3d movie you can get your hands on . these movies are thrilling though- especially the non-stop coaster rides in each one . do you hear what i am saying ? ? buy this ... ... now ! ! you can thank me later ! ! ! 100 stars if i could and of course..highly reccomended
0	sit down under a tree , give it a big hug , fire up you bong and go to sleep . that 's what i was waiting for freeman to do all movie . it 's a shame that special effects that were so ground breaking were waisted on this sci-fi hippie flick . i 'm surprised that freeman 's suit was n't tie-dyed . keep your money say no to drugs !
1	a dvd with a message that pulls at the heart , and presents sadness and then joy to the viewer . strong singing cast with excellent voices . a must see
0	quite possibly one of the worst movies of all time . clive owen is really cool , but not in this movie . angelina jolie 's polital agenda totally fueled this film . what a waste of time
0	`` incredible '' i saw one review describing this production . the meaning of the word must have been changed in the dictionary because this is not incredible . it is slow , convoluted and uninspired . no chemistry exists between the actresses , with no connection to the audience .
