1	successfully blended satire , high camp and yet another sexual taboo into a really funny movie . 
0	unlike trey parker , sandler doesn't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself . 
1	the real star of this movie is the score , as in the songs translate well to film , and it's really well directed . 
1	it is different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches ; it primarily relies on character to tell its story . 
1	jackson tries to keep the plates spinning as best he can , but all the bouncing back and forth can't help but become a bit tedious -- even with the breathtaking landscapes and villainous varmints there to distract you from the ricocheting . 
0	maudlin and melodramatic we expected . boring we didn't . 
0	a film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this isn't . 
0	downright transparent is the script's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a " cooler " pg-13 rating . 
1	films are made of little moments . changing lanes tries for more . it doesn't reach them , but the effort is gratefully received . 
1	presents an astute appraisal of middle american musical torpor and the desperate struggle to escape it . 
0	the worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors
1	remove spider-man the movie from its red herring surroundings and it's apparent that this is one summer film that satisfies . 
1	creepy , authentic and dark . this disturbing bio-pic is hard to forget . 
1	a gripping movie , played with performances that are all understated and touching . 
0	another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing , moldering pile of , well , extreme stunt pictures . 
1	the aaa of action , xxx is a blast of adrenalin , rated eee for excitement . and vin diesel is the man . 
0	somehow we're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become g . i . jane . 
1	a beautiful and haunting examination of the stories we tell ourselves to make sense of the mundane horrors of the world . 
1	too damn weird to pass up , and for the blacklight crowd , way cheaper ( and better ) than pink floyd tickets . 
0	for those for whom the name woody allen was once a guarantee of something fresh , sometimes funny , and usually genuinely worthwhile , hollywood ending is a depressing experience
1	majidi's poetic love story is a ravishing consciousness-raiser , if a bit draggy at times . 
1	if you can get past the taboo subject matter , it will be well worth your time . 
0	the gantzes' interviews tend to let the guys off the hook . 
1	when you think you've figured out bielinsky's great game , that's when you're in the most trouble : he's the con , and you're just the mark . 
1	a wild ride juiced with enough energy and excitement for at least three films . 
1	there is a real subject here , and it is handled with intelligence and care . 
0	doesn't deliver a great story , nor is the action as gripping as in past seagal films . 
0	a supernatural mystery that doesn't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama . it ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors . 
0	if it's seldom boring , well , it's also rarely coherent . 
1	an enthralling aesthetic experience , one that's steeped in mystery and a ravishing , baroque beauty . 
0	with minimal imagination , you could restage the whole thing in your bathtub . 
0	gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it's not clear whether we're supposed to shriek or laugh . 
0	the plot's contrivances are uncomfortably strained . 
1	efficient , suitably anonymous chiller . 
0	exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable . 
1	exquisitely nuanced in mood tics and dialogue , this chamber drama is superbly acted by the deeply appealing veteran bouquet and the chilling but quite human berling . 
0	so muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker's characteristic style . 
0	a well-crafted letdown . 
1	a surprisingly funny movie . 
0	check your brain and your secret agent decoder ring at the door because you don't want to think too much about what's going on . the movie does has some entertainment value - how much depends on how well you like chris rock . 
0	it's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that hollywood isn't laughing with us , folks . it's laughing at us . 
0	bears is bad . not 'terrible filmmaking' bad , but more like , 'i once had a nightmare like this , and it's now coming true' bad . 
0	full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in . 
0	a synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness . 
1	while the story does seem pretty unbelievable at times , it's awfully entertaining to watch . 
0	juliette binoche's sand is vivacious , but it's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile . 
1	it has the charm of the original american road movies , feasting on the gorgeous , ramshackle landscape of the filmmaker's motherland . 
1	piercingly affecting . . . while clearly a manipulative film , emerges as powerful rather than cloying . 
0	it's better than mid-range steven seagal , but not as sharp as jet li on rollerblades . 
1	manages to delight without much of a story . 
0	often silly  and gross  but it's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films . 
0	reggio's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified nike ad . 
0	admirably ambitious but self-indulgent . 
0	 . . . a cheap , ludicrous attempt at serious horror . 
0	not completely loveable -- but what underdog movie since the bad news bears has been ? -- but certainly hard to hate . 
1	this ecologically minded , wildlife friendly film teaches good ethics while entertaining with its unconventionally wacky but loving family
0	for casual moviegoers who stumble into rules expecting a slice of american pie hijinks starring the kid from dawson's creek , they'll probably run out screaming . 
1	the warnings to resist temptation in this film . . . are blunt and challenging and offer no easy rewards for staying clean . 
0	everything else about high crimes is , like the military system of justice it portrays , tiresomely regimented . 
1	the unique tug-of-war with viewer expectations is undeniable , if not a pleasure in its own right . 
1	all leather pants & augmented boobs , hawn is hilarious as she tries to resuscitate the fun-loving libertine lost somewhere inside the conservative , handbag-clutching sarandon . 
0	how can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ? in truth , it has all the heart of a porno flick ( but none of the sheer lust ) . 
1	dark , resonant , inventively detailed and packed with fleet turns of plot and a feast of visual amazement . 
0	the words , 'frankly , my dear , i don't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate .

0	schneidermeister . . . makin' a fool of himself . . . losin' his fan base . . . 
0	'rare birds' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience . 
1	an engrossing story that combines psychological drama , sociological reflection , and high-octane thriller . 
0	like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all . 
0	mckay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service . 
0	even if britney spears is really cute , her movie is really bad . 
1	much of the movie's charm lies in the utter cuteness of stuart and margolo . their computer-animated faces are very expressive . 
1	the performances are uniformly good . 
1	sometimes , nothing satisfies like old-fashioned swashbuckling . and in this regard , on guard delivers . 
1	i encourage young and old alike to go see this unique and entertaining twist on the classic whale's tale -- you won't be sorry ! 
0	was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ? 
1	the new insomnia is a surprisingly faithful remake of its chilly predecessor , and when it does elect to head off in its own direction , it employs changes that fit it well rather than ones that were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities . 
0	for all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , lily chou-chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam . 
0	a good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast , but never quite gets off the ground . 
1	works because , for the most part , it avoids the stupid cliches and formulaic potholes that befall its brethren . 
0	imagine ( if possible ) a pasolini film without passion or politics , or an almodovar movie without beauty or humor , and you have some idea of the glum , numb experience of watching o fantasma . 
0	the ending is a cop-out . what happens to john q ? i don't have an i am sam clue . 
1	 . . . a quietly introspective portrait of the self-esteem of employment and the shame of losing a job . . . 
0	'es en verdad una pena que mandoki esté realizando cintas tan malas desde hace algún tiempo , pues talento tiene , pero quién sabe dónde lo tiene escondido . '
1	a comedy that is warm , inviting , and surprising . 
0	the filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women . 
0	pretend it's a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away . it's fun , but it's a real howler . 
0	arnold's jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces . 
1	a resonant tale of racism , revenge and retribution . 
1	what could have been a daytime soap opera is actually a compelling look at a young woman's tragic odyssey . 
1	like most bond outings in recent years , some of the stunts are so outlandish that they border on being cartoonlike . a heavy reliance on cgi technology is beginning to creep into the series . 
0	how many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other ? 
1	full of bland hotels , highways , parking lots , with some glimpses of nature and family warmth , time out is a discreet moan of despair about entrapment in the maze of modern life . 
1	É uma pena que , mais tarde , o próprio filme abandone o tom de paródia e passe a utilizar os mesmos clichês que havia satirizado . 
0	suffers from unlikable characters and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness . 
0	it's all pretty tame . the most offensive thing about the movie is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it . 
0	to the filmmakers , ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there's no indication that he's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit . 
1	the fourth " pokemon " is a diverting--if predictable--adventure suitable for a matinee , with a message that cautions children about disturbing the world's delicate ecological balance . 
0	what madonna does here can't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it's moving and it's talking and it's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once . 
1	this quiet , introspective and entertaining independent is worth seeking . 
1	lightweight but appealing . 
0	if damon and affleck attempt another project greenlight , next time out they might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about . 
1	kids will love its fantasy and adventure , and grownups should appreciate its whimsical humor . 
0	to build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved . 
0	a 75-minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor . 
1	an interesting psychological game of cat-and-mouse , three-dimensional characters and believable performances all add up to a satisfying crime drama . 
0	the trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through . 
0	it appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen . 
1	visually imaginative , thematically instructive and thoroughly delightful , it takes us on a roller-coaster ride from innocence to experience without even a hint of that typical kiddie-flick sentimentality . 
1	hands down the year's most thought-provoking film . but it pays a price for its intricate intellectual gamesmanship . 
1	the son's room is a triumph of gentility that earns its moments of pathos . 
0	doesn't really add up to much . 
0	i've heard that the fans of the first men in black have come away hating the second one . i wonder why . they felt like the same movie to me . 
1	a beautiful , entertaining two hours . you get the idea , though , that kapur intended the film to be more than that . 
0	in trying to be daring and original , it comes off as only occasionally satirical and never fresh . 
1	this surreal gilliam-esque film is also a troubling interpretation of ecclesiastes . a rewarding work of art for only the most patient and challenge-hungry moviegoers . 
0	even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity didn't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by avary's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest . 
1	[shyamalan] turns the goose-pimple genre on its empty head and fills it with spirit , purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count . 
0	at best this is a film for the under-7 crowd . but it would be better to wait for the video . and a very rainy day . 
1	delirious fun . 
0	this goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring
0	consider the film a celluloid litmus test for the intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director i admire . 
0	if swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh . 
0	the director mostly plays it straight , turning leys' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder . 
1	an engrossing and grim portrait of hookers : what they think of themselves and their clients . 
1	this isn't a retooled genre piece , the tale of a guy and his gun , but an amiably idiosyncratic work . 
0	as social exposé , skins has its heart in the right place , but that's not much to hang a soap opera on . 
1	not only is undercover brother as funny , if not more so , than both austin powers films , but it's also one of the smarter , savvier spoofs to come along in some time . 
1	chicago offers much colorful eye candy , including the spectacle of gere in his dancing shoes , hoofing and crooning with the best of them . 
0	forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining . 
0	in the real world , an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a résumé loaded with credits like " girl in bar #3 . " 
0	astonishing isn't the word -- neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap . indeed , none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is deuces wild . 
0	the actresses may have worked up a back story for the women they portray so convincingly , but viewers don't get enough of that background for the characters to be involving as individuals rather than types . 
1	whether you're moved and love it , or bored or frustrated by the film , you'll still feel something . 
1	the movie has an avalanche of eye-popping visual effects . 
0	the intent is almost exactly the same [as the full monty] . all that's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight . 
1	shiner can certainly go the distance , but isn't world championship material
0	 it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes . 
0	to my taste , the film's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation . 
0	i can easily imagine benigni's pinocchio becoming a christmas perennial . coal isn't as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children's stockings . 
0	a vile , incoherent mess . . . a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg's brilliant 'videodrome . '
1	rich in shadowy metaphor and as sharp as a samurai sword , jiang wen's devils on the doorstep is a wartime farce in the alternately comic and gut-wrenching style of joseph heller or kurt vonnegut . 
0	fairly run-of-the-mill . 
0	looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights . 
0	this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long . 
1	what time is it there ? is not easy . it haunts you , you can't forget it , you admire its conception and are able to resolve some of the confusions you had while watching it . 
0	bullock's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
0	in terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused . 
1	y tu mamá también is hilariously , gloriously alive , and quite often hotter than georgia asphalt . 
0	[the film's] taste for " shock humor " will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of tom green and the farrelly brothers . 
0	it's sweet . . . but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end . 
1	a must-see for fans of thoughtful war films and those interested in the sights and sounds of battle . 
0	it's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex . 
1	tunney , brimming with coltish , neurotic energy , holds the screen like a true star . 
0	being author wells' great-grandson , you'd think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material . but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film . 
0	the transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull . 
1	the more you think about the movie , the more you will probably like it . 
1	for all its failed connections , divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood is nurturing , in a gauzy , dithering way . 
1	a triumph , relentless and beautiful in its downbeat darkness . 
0	the film is surprisingly well-directed by brett ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act . 
0	very stupid and annoying . 
0	this thing is just garbage . 
1	hugely accomplished slice of hitchcockian suspense . 
0	overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek's novel by some way . it settles for being merely grim . 
0	boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome . 
1	so vivid a portrait of a woman consumed by lust and love and crushed by betrayal that it conjures up the intoxicating fumes and emotional ghosts of a freshly painted rembrandt . 
1	turturro is fabulously funny and over the top as a 'very sneaky' butler who excels in the art of impossible disappearing/reappearing acts
0	in the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate . 
0	stale and clichéd to a fault . 
1	with we were soldiers , hollywood makes a valiant attempt to tell a story about the vietnam war before the pathology set in . 
1	it's a much more emotional journey than what shyamalan has given us in his past two movies , and gibson , stepping in for bruce willis , is the perfect actor to take us on the trip . 
0	pompous and garbled . 
1	adaptation is simply brilliant . 
0	to the vast majority of more casual filmgoers , it will probably be a talky bore . 
1	for the first time in years , de niro digs deep emotionally , perhaps because he's been stirred by the powerful work of his co-stars . 
1	the premise of jason x is silly but strangely believable . 
1	a lot of the credit for the film's winning tone must go to grant , who hasn't lost a bit of the dry humor that first made audiences on both sides of the atlantic love him . 
0	though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by james spader and maggie gyllenhaal , i felt disrespected . 
1	those prone to indignation need not apply ; those susceptible to blue hilarity , step right up . 
0	this is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions -- a lunar mission with no signs of life . 
1	a pleasant romantic comedy . 
0	a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse . 
1	funny and , at times , poignant , the film from director george hickenlooper all takes place in pasadena , " a city where people still read . " 
1	what makes this film special is serry's ability to take what is essentially a contained family conflict and put it into a much larger historical context . 
1	the date movie that franz kafka would have made . 
0	este é apenas mais um ( longo ) episódio do programa da mtv . a única diferença é que , desta vez , a paramount teve o mau gosto de exibi-lo nos cinemas . 
0	is " ballistic " worth the price of admission ? absolutely not . it sucked . would i see it again ? please see previous answer . 
1	thrilling , provocative and darkly funny , this timely sci-fi mystery works on so many different levels that it not only invites , it demands repeated viewings . 
1	baby-faced renner is eerily convincing as this bland blank of a man with unimaginable demons within . 
1	hu and liu offer natural , matter-of-fact performances that glint with sorrow , longing and love . 
0	brown's saga , like many before his , makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie . 
0	i'm not saying that ice age doesn't have some fairly pretty pictures , but there's not enough substance in the story to actually give them life . 
0	birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it . 
0	comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class . . . . designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , " crossroads " instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns . 
1	at once a testament to the divine calling of education and a demonstration of the painstaking process of imparting knowledge . 
0	the movie's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself doesn't stand a ghost of a chance . 
0	truth to tell , if you've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there's nothing here you haven't seen before . 
0	a dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any hollywood fluff . 
1	moore provides an invaluable service by sparking debate and encouraging thought . better still , he does all of this , and more , while remaining one of the most savagely hilarious social critics this side of jonathan swift . 
0	with a tone as variable as the cinematography , schaeffer's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters' quirks and foibles never jell into charm .
