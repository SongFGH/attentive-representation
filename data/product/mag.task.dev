1	instyle magazine takes its readers into the lives of celebrities and makes them accessible . the features are very informative and fun . i enjoy the man of style feature and the entertaining guide best ! for more on mags , visit my blog at magazinediva.typepad.com
1	i 'm pretty critical and picky about the magazines i read and elle is one of the few that raise the standards . a lot of the information given , whether its clothes or advice , is very practical
0	the amazon ad said next day shipping . took over a month for the first magazine to arrive . do not buy this from amazo
0	but that 's the lowest we 're allowed to give . this magazine is more for 16 year olds and up . too much focus on getting a boyfriend and making out - every 10 year old 's top priority right ? plus my daughter found extremely crude language in the latest issue - magazine refused to discuss the matter when i emailed and called them ! says it 's geared for girls 8 and up but that 's a huge age span . better off with american girl magazine - this one 's to mature for younger girls .
1	when i was little , my dad always said good things about this magazine . my attitude was always `` i 'm not gon na buy a magazine to bore myself some more '' - i mean , c'mon , it 's a history magazine . i was absolutely wrong . i picked up this magazine one day and i was hooked . i would say that american heritage has found its way to make history interesting . one way that it does this is to somehow weave issues of current interest ( as subtle as they may be ) into its articles . on the second thought , i should have listened to my dad from the beginning - he 's an anesthesiologist - he knows what put people to sleep and what does not . this magazine keeps me awake - sometimes i would put my paper/project aside just so that i could finish my copy in one sitting . it 's unfortunate that this magazine only comes out every two months . american heritage makes history grrreattt ! ... even for a non-history buff in his early 20 's like myself
0	please see tj-mccarthy 's review elsewhere here ; he is , to borrow a phrase from across the pond , spot-on in his comments . just this week i cancelled my 10-year subscription to pc magazine . one thing not mentioned elsewhere is that the new editor , jim louderback , has dropped the old tagline on the front cover , `` an independent guide to technology '' . i conjecture that the reason for doing so is that this magazine is no longer independent and is , in fact , just a marketing vehicle for various products . if you are like me and you do not like stealth marketing , stay away from this publication
0	this magazine fell apart so quick . they are no longer a unbias magazine . instead they are a interscope propaganda machine . just look at the covers ? every year shady/g-unit gets a automatic 8 covers . every album from that camp gets automatic xxl and xl ratings . even the horrible tony yayo album got a xl maybe the most disgraful rating i 've ever seen in hip hop . as a hip hop reader i can never take anything they write serious because they are tainted and corrupt . i suggest you search else where if you want a good hip hop mag
0	this mag needs a new editor . i have n't seen anything interesting in better homes for six months . maybe they are spread too thin with their website and contests
1	although the target audience is stated to be 8-12 year old , my seven year old is completely fascinated with this magazine . she has thanked me countless times for the subscription and looks forward to each month with anticipation . not only are the stories lively and entertaining , they are educational as well ( i am also learning various things about history and culture that i did not know before ! ) . there is a good mix of fiction and non fiction stories as well as poetry . since receiving this magazine , i have noticed her excelling more at reading comprehension and her own story writing skills . these reasons are why i believe it is well worth the money and i wll be renewing our subscription for a very long time .
1	car and driver is the multi-purpose auto magazine . it is a hybrid between magazines like road and track , which focus on the exotic and the extreme in the auto world , and magazines like motor trend , which focus on the more practical . the magazine is always a fun , intereseting read , and keeps you up to date on teh auto world . i must , however , say , that it does not do as good of a job at rating cars as motor trend , and it does n't have quite the coverage of the exotics as road and track ( and definitely falls short of road and track 's superb photography . )
0	if i could give it a zero or negative rating i would . when vibe was introduced , it was a relevant , interesting magazine that exposed me to new alternative , r and hip hop artists . the mag featured all kinds of artists not just who 's hot right now , it also featured hard hitting expose articles that were relevant to not only the hip hop community but the world . lately i 've noticed that it 's nothing more than a fluffy version of the source . i hate a lot of new rap music that 's out and did n't appreciate mags with rappers i dislike on the cover . and is it me or does it seem like since mimi took over , all of the female r singers ' covers and stories are horrible ( we wo n't even discuss that disgusting brandy cover ) ! this magazine sucks now and the only time i check it out is while i 'm in line at the grocery store . yes , the subscription rates are cut to the bone now but that is because the quality is supremely lacking . i 'd advise the curious to check issues out at newstands or where ever before wasting your hard earned money on a subscription
1	i like this magazine but i like simple scrapbooks better . it seems as though they have the same featured scrapbookers layouts in there all the time ... just from what i 've observed anyway . i like the layouts , they have good ideas , great tips on tools and some good tips on digital scrapbooking
1	jeff goldblum 's character in `` the big chill '' said that he could n't write an article longer than the average person could read during a , er , `` trip to the library '' ( wink , wink , nudge , nudge , know what i mean ? ) . the writers at details seems to have the same marching orders . in these hectic times , maybe that 's not so bad . the articles i have read are well researched and nicely bite-sized . i actually finished the entire magazine between pm mail delivery and breakfast the next day . the topics they covered in my first issue ranged from fashion to health concerns . and , again , they cover the topics in very few , well-written pages . i do think the models look like under-fed children but at my age , that could be tunnel-vision ( grey hair , i remember filmore east , you get the picture ? ) . my suggestion , take a look . it 's a magazine with an interesting voice and it may be for you .
1	first , i received this subscription as a gift for the holidays and can say that it is the gift that just gives , and gives , and gives . this magazine has been a wonderful source of ideas for in the kitchen , on the grill , around the house , in my garden , in the state as well as all through the south for traveling . being a woman who moved from the detroit suburbs to florida so i could be with ailing family , i was really a duck out of my elements . i had no idea of what was where within the state ; what are good places to visit , where are some of the great attractions outside of orlando , the keys , and the everglades and who does what where . in this magazine , there are sections devoted just to florida ( which i suspect they do for each state per subscription ) -- what to plant when , what festivals are going on , what 's hot and what 's not - a whole derth of information devoted just to the state i live in . and that 's not all ... not only do i get to learn more about where i am today , i can explore and learn about where i 'd like to go tomorrow . one month , it 's `` welcome to alabama '' and all the wonderful gems it has to offer . another month , i am poring over beautiful georgia . a different topic ? seafood of the south . how would you like to learn about fantasic , but yet unknown , places for bargains and great finds ? now - i am also an avid cook at home - and i can not tell you how much i love to read through and try/improvise on all the de-lish recipes found each month closer to the back of the magazine . how many differnt ways have i learned to make potato salad alone is worth the cost of admission ! i have learned so much more about grilling , vegetable side dishes , breakfast treats and savories from all over the south , tempting , lip-smacking desserts - and everything in between . i have always known the south was the jewel of the states when it came to cooking - but w.o.w ! so much history and fun can be shared whether it be in the kitchen or on the grill . and it is a great compliment to what i learn from other books , the food channel , and beyond . it speaks to where i live , what i can get down here , and what the heck plantains are anyway : - ) i love looking through many of the decorating ideas , the travel tips , and vignettes of different states , or towns , or themes . the only reason this magazine does not get a 5 from me is that it sometimes caters/addresses a crowd which can afford more than i can in the way of travel , decorating , etc . i am more simple , down-to-earth folk , and do not share much with `` decorating your summer cottage '' , or what to do with that spare $ thousand plus dollars on a cruise , or splurge excursion . sometimes , and since they are not making this magazine specifically for me i am not going to be able to relate to everything , i am not the crowd they are talking to . otherwise , this magazine is a 10 in my book : - ) well worth the money - but even more so - the anticipation of next month 's `` explorations ''
0	a friend of mine got me a subscription to this magazine because i like cooks illustrated . this magazine is nothing but ads for snazzy expensive foods and restaurants . there are so few recipies in it i would n't call it a 'cooking ' magazine . what few recipies they do have do n't explain why they chose the ingredients used or give much detail at all . if you consider yourself a 'foodie ' who likes to go to fancy restaurants and likes to know what 's hip on the latest gourmet food and wine , then this magazine might be for you . if , however , you like to cook and know what you are doing and why you are doing it , try cooks illustrated instead .
1	i 've been reading men 's journal since the first issue . i 've always enjoyed its mix of content . mj interviews a wide range of interesting individuals . over the years i 've incorporated some of the workout tips from mj 's fitness pages into my workout routine . i especially enjoy reading the product reviews . the travel recommendations are always well written , if not sometimes beyond the budget of most readers ( myself included ! ) . overall , men 's journal offers a great mix of well written content
0	i found this magazine to be helpful for an introduction to advanced computing . that 's about it . this mag seems to be biased towards certain products & amp ; manufacturers . they neglected to open my eyes wider . the reviews/articles that are published seem to favor big money companies ( microsoft , dell , etc ) . they do n't give credit to smaller , better , less-well-known companies and technologies . all the info is pretty basic for intro users , but if that 's what you are interested in ... then this is a great non-comlicated publication
0	esquire is a subpar men 's magazine , in my opinon . more than half of the magazine is advertisements , and when you finally get to the articles they are rarely entertaining and/or thought-provoking . if you like ads and cologne samples , pick it up . after all , it is pretty decently priced
1	in christmas of 2005 i decided i wanted the most interesting and best cooking magazines out there . but which ones to pick ? after buying one here and there i found three that i absolutely love . saveur was one . the recipes are nice though some i would n't touch with a ten foot pole ( ethnic ingredients that do n't appeal to me ) . but the stories and the pictures ... they are n't just amazing , they 're astounding ! where national geographic talks about certain things or places , saveur takes you to different places and shows you what 's there and how they eat . they showed me ireland and i even made colcannon ( a mashed potato and cabbage dish ) everyone loved it . i made a french dish last night that was amazing . it was a little time consuming but worth it ! i do have admit i was a little disappointed with my first issue i received from them with my subscription . it looked like a dog ate it then ran through the water with it . it 's readable but i was n't happy . they also promise two exclusive magazines for new subscribers . i 've never seen them . but i have been getting my magazines and they look good . i was thinking about it the other night , my three magazines i picked ... one was articles and recipes about healthy eating ( eating well ) , one was easier recipes with no articles ( everyday food ) , and then saveur . if i could only pick one to keep ... it would be saveur . it 's really that good of a read .
1	still think that marie claire is a cut above most women 's magazines
0	i was very disappointed with this magazine . the tech reviews have absolutely no depth to them . most articles are rather pretentious and boring . in the 5 issues i have received so far only the may 2006 issue had any thing interesting . and it only had two articles which were worth it . the first was `` robbed blind '' which was about rfid chips and the second article was `` diy ways to go green ''
0	good housekeeping does not send a notice to the person receiving the subscription in a timly manner . it should n't take 2 to 3 weeks to receive notification
0	well , imagine my surprise when i picked up the february 2004 issue , and found that things had drastically changed . mainly in the editor 's letter . it used to be 1 page , now it 's just a small little column now , that is exactly like other ziff davis game mags , now the redesign isnt as bad as other zd game mags , but the removal of the 1 page editor 's letter , really steams me up . at least they didnt bother executive editor robert coffey 's scorched earth column . it 's still 1 page . it 's on the last page usually . and yes the redesign is really bad in terms of readability . most of the time they have a red or blue or yellow background , and it 's really hard to read the text at times . now at least their disc will auto-load , unlike pc gamer . and what really pisses me off , is when a magazine has a hot 100 section , or a best pc 's or videocards , or peripherals section , and they hardly ever change the captions or descriptions come with it . i 'm sorry if i got off track a lot , but i felt the need to . i hope this review helped you . edit : 5/8/2004 pc gamer recently changed editor 's and the editor-in-chief was re-assigned to become the editor-in-chief of the official xbox magazine . the new eic of pcg is the former executive editor , and i hate him , so this is why i say cgw is now the best pc games magazine
1	this magazine provides interesting stories and information about american history and cultural life . most often it is very pleasant reading .
1	i 've received the whole dog journal for the past year . i have found it to be refreshing as it has no advertisements . it 's pure holistic news , information , health , nutrition , training , food testing , and anything else pertaining to dogs ! i would recommend this magazine to new dog owners as well as seasoned . one thing about the world of dogs is that it is ever changing . it 's not always easy to get information that is up-to-date , helpful , and necessary . with the whole dog journal one can be certain that they will have the best knowledge
1	this magazine is ... well ... sweet . i love it . i picked up a subscription in january and i think it 's great . they get previews on a ton of games , even those that are n't that gossiped about . they bring a vieraty in opinions when it comes to there reviews . they get a scoped up article on new games very fast . they 're not centered on only the good games , but they also include a `` shame of the month '' ( lowest scoring game of the month ) award . they include three scores from a scale of 1-10 and the reviewers simply put out the truth and down right say that a game sucks . they have full coverage on new platforms and games . they also include posters and stragety guides with some of their issuses . this magazine is alot better than the dragonball z obssessed , gamepro . its fast and relibel . definetly a great buy .
0	i am utterly disappointed in the direction that gamepro has taken over the past two years . i actually stopped my subscription for about 1 year , but came back to the 20 issues for $ 10 at their ( 10 ? ) year anniversary . i forget . but the magazine is really bad . one thing i laugh is , the retro corner . they have info about issues from 5 and 10 years before , and they always announce the number of pages from 10 years ago . i think the most recent issue , they said : 140 pages ? huh ? i think my last issue was around 100 . and do n't try to tell me they 've lost 40 pages in advertising . too bad on-line reviews and websites , are taking over the subscriptions of the hardcopy magazines . i 'll stick with hardcopy until the end of my life . or until the quality of these types of magazines gets so low , i ca n't stand it anymore . or until my subscription runs out on this craptacular effort . you guys were pretty good 5 years ago , but you 've gone to pot these past two years ! i 'm talkin ' to you watchdawg ! ! ! you guys are suckin ' lately ! ! ! mc white said : you guys are suckin ' ! !
1	i highly recommend highlights for children . it 's a great way for children to begin reading in a very fun way . watch your child 's eyes read with delight as they have fun with puzzles , hidden pictures , games , and fun and entertaining stories . cynthia marie rizzo , author of julie and the unicorn
1	ok. for those of you who continue to believe that new york is the center of the united states , hell , the world , who forgot the map cnn kept flashing with the two different colors after the election that might infer there are several schools of thought about the polycentric views of the us , for those of you who can take a little criticism from the midwest , the dark states , middle earth , the elba of the 21st century , you 're not . there 's a whole world out here . people have jobs . yes , it 's true . we work , send our kids to school , even go to church on sundays . and on other days too . we vote . oh , yeah , you already know that . so having an interview with an actor who goes on about how he meditates , is a vegan and thinks about trees and birds when he has a particularly stressful scene with ashley or uma or diane , you know , it just does n't carry a lot of weight with the serfs . but . . . . it 's a great magazine . andy lives . photography is tight and realistic . the ads are sexy and provocative . the sidebars interesting and insightful . it 's wordly . it covers music as well as rs . it 's ( do n't get all riled up now ) a fun magazine to read . however , the interviews which we are led to believe are the heart and soul of the magazine , seem to be along the lines of 'damn , it 's so good to be me and i guess you 're ok too . ' or , 'i see you 're wearing a $ 15,000 versace with a plunging neckline and . . . you 've selected old , black , converse all stars to wear with it ! how noveau ! how tasteful ! ' come on . where 's the bite ? where 's the interview with alex rodriguez that says 'how come you went to therapy . . . it 's only new york ? ' or with marv alpert 'hey what 's on your fashion agenda now ? ' chris berman from espn says he was on maui a couple of years back and he was walking with his kids one dawn and he ran into steven stills with his kids . now that 's a conversation i would have liked to hear , not one that ends up with me thinking the two parties to the conversation ( it sure is n't an interview - see columbia university 's interviewing 101 in their school of journalism ) are off to pick out furniture . it 's new york . show your teeth . flex . 5 stars . larry scantlebury
1	as a library administrator i get to see and read an awful lot of woodworking books and magazines . i have been a personal subscriber to woodworker 's journal for a year now , and an off and on reader of the magazine for about 5 years . in that time i have grown to appreciate this as a very good woodworking magazine . is it my favorite ? no , but i still like it well enough to recommend it to others . i also regularly read fine woodworking , workbench , wood , popular woodworking , etc . and like all of those , this magazine has its strengths . i find that wj is very into power tools , tool reviews ( theirs are among my favorites ) , and shop projects . having said all of that , i also must confess that the best piece of furniture i ever built came from a plan in wj magazine ( an arts crafts style wine storage table ) , so do n't pigeon-hole it too much . try it for a year and i bet you wo n't be sorry !
0	i bought into a subscription of this magazine sight unseen . that was a bad decision . after having received two issues , i continue to be disappointed . the quality of the art design , and products displayed overall are dreadfully amateurish and in most cases incredibly tacky . i would be hard pressed to think that anyone in pursuit of help with romanticing their home would be inspired by this magazine .
0	i echo the same gripe that other reviewers have voiced here : the magazine covers the same handful of people week after week after boring week . how many times is a reader going to see no talents such as jessica simpson , lindsay lohan , the tom cruise-katie holmes joke , and the most overrated , overhyped people of all time brad pitt and angelina jolie on the cover and not get tired of it ? it 's nice to know what 's going on with certain celebrities once in a while but every single week ? can you say `` overkill ? '' i 'm glad i never got a subscription to this magazine . i picked it up every once in a while on the newsstand but stopped because i was so sick and tired of reading about overrated , overhyped and glorified b-movie `` actors '' and `` actresses '' who were lucky to be in one successful movie and have n't done anything of value since . i picked up a copy today and have sworn it off forever . do n't waste your time or your money . - donna di giacom
0	i am sure this will be a great magazine , but i have not received my first issue yet
0	so i ordered the magazine in nov. 6 , 2005 . its now feb. 22nd , 2006 and the magazines ( since i also ordered the smithsonian and scientific american ) are nowhere to be seen . of course , my account was quickly charged and at this pace , i 'm guessing the whole genomic structure of all living organisms in this planet will be decoded before i receive any of them ... so if you actually want to read this excellent magazine , it might be a better idea to get somewhere else..
1	well i echo what all the other reviews have said about this magazine . subscibing to this magazine is making sure that unbiased articles can still exist for all makes and models of sports cars . you see there are extremely few ads in this magazine and so even though the mag is a bit smaller than say a car and driver magazine it is loaded front to back with reviews . one after another . the photography is fantastic and just looking at the pictures makes you wonder what some of the other mainstream magazines could be like if they could just try to put out a better quality product . even the cardstock of the paper is first rate . it makes the car and driver mag feel so cheap in comparison . both come to my address and i honestly can say that i look forward to both but for different reasons . i first stumbled upon this magazine at an airport 6 years ago and i am so glad that i did . i would love to see more articles with affordable sports car alternatives as they print at the end of each issue . i remember an article about what used sports cars you could buy with certain dollar amounts and this was to me ( a man on a budget ) a rather nice look at the market as a whole that year . also we are not all 16 year olds out there subscirbing to this magazine so it would be nice to see road tests on at least one moderatly priced non exotic each issue . thank you for putting together such a high quality magazine for your readers to enjoy .
0	i was one of entertainment weekly 's charter subscribers way back in 1990 . it started out great -- a different , intelligent and witty approach to entertainment coverage . but financially , things were shaky , so the magazine was dumbed down a bit to reach a wider audience . i could n't blame the editors . it helped them reach the needed tipping point , and they gained their needed mass audience . ew remained better than any other publication with an entertainment focus , and i kept resubscribing . until 2006 . these last few months , ew has fallen off a cliff . it has become entirely superficial and shallow , with hardly any substance at all . the publication design has also been degraded into a teen magazine format . i can only imagine the editors have decided that anyone over 30 is no longer part of their target audience . so , i 've let my subscription lapse -- reluctantly , mourning the enjoyable magazine that used to be
0	this magazine seems to exist solely to promote their advertisers and their products . their articles focus heavily on their sponsors and the ads far outweigh what little content there is . when they do focus on the best work of the design community , their examples are puzzling . they choose work that is often genuinely awful , and you rarely see any of the work that wins awards in other publications and award shows ( comarts , adc , graphis , aiga , one club ) . while that would be admirable had they found other good work , most of the work they highlight is mediocre at best . there is a reason this magazine is free

1	men 's health magazine provides informationand tips on men 's fitness , health , sex , career , relationships , nutrition , recipes , weight loss and muscle building.no matter how much you know about men 's health , there 's always room to know more about ways to a better lifestyle , the top men 's health concerns , and the importance of getting medical care and regular screening tests.so you deserve to pay more attention to yourself ! take better care of yourself physically , mentally , and emotionally . or if you are a woman searching for ways to help the men in your life , tell them about the men 's health . one way to start is to use the resources you 'll find in the magazine here.this magazine is dealing with all aspects of the daily lives .
0	where are the critiques ? the articles lack any critical substance . whoever is hot at the moment will get their behind kissed . it does n't matter that the album is usually not worth all the hype , vibe will go along with the flow . on top of that , there are more ads now than ever before . even articles that could have been decent are cut down to a page or so for the sake of saving advertising space .
1	sports car international never loses focus on its mission : providing insight into everything that defines a true sports car . i do not need to waste time flipping past crossover reviews or cup holder size specs . from the absolutely most exotic and expensive supercars to the new hard-top mx-5 , it just sticks to real sports cars . seems simple , right ? yet no one else gets it quite as right
0	this magazine used to be very thorough , and it used to be very good at providing me with tons of deals and tips that i never would have found on my own . it was great , and very opinionated . but last year sometime , they changed the look of it and now there 's a lot less text . it 's much more a style magazine now , and that 's not what i want in a travel magazine that i have bought to tell me about money saving ! worse , except for the 40 best vacation bargains , which are still okay , most of the articles forget to incluce a lot of money-saving tips and instead they too often suggest i do expensive things . since when is a $ 225 a night hotel considered budget ? ? the headlines and captions are expecially smart-aalecky . it 's not as good with the expert advice as it used to be ! i noticed that arthur frommer is n't editing it anymore which maybe is why -- bring him back ! my search for a true money-saving travel magazine has unfortunately resumed again
0	i subscribed to this magazine for a year and found it a waste of money . every issue has a girl in a bikini on the front ( ca n't a woman look sexy in anything but ? ) and every issue claims to have `` the best ever exercise for ... . '' ok..what about the last 10 issues that claimed to have the same thing..those exercises are no longer `` best ever ? '' i did n't like the fashion sections , and i also do n't like how there really are n't any articles . when i subscribe to a magazine i 'd like to be able to read it , not just look at pictures . the only thing i liked about it were the success stories..and even those seemed repetitive ... are we only allowed fruit and grilled chicken ?
0	i ordered the magazine `` all in '' on october 10 , 2006 for my boyfriend for a christmas present it is now jan. 15 , 2007 and we still have n't received the magazine . my checking account was charged for these magazines the very day i purchased the magazines so ... ... ..i payed for something 3 months ago and still have n't received them . i dout that i will purchase anything else from amazon.com on line penny stephen
0	i ordered this magazine as a gift . not only was there no gift card sent , but the company sent the magazine to me instead of gift recipient . it took about 20 minutes on the phone with the subscription company to fix the problem and not once was there any mention of an apology for the inconvenience . the biggest disappointment was not having a gift on time !
1	inc. magazine is a publication designed to guide small businesses on their path to prosperity . with inc. , you get timely advice on taxes , marketing , financing , and many other important considerations and challenges that business owners face every day . probably the strongest point of inc. is the way it presents important information to readers . the authors of this magazine get directly to the point . they do n't waste your time with petty discussions and attempts to soften the blow of an undesirable fact . even when the news is bad , like with regulations , taxation , etc. , inc. lets you have it in a direct manner . this is good , because i get annoyed by magazines that try to ease the reader into hearing some unwelcome news and then try to downplay the facts . inc. writers are direct , and i respect them for that . if there were some criticisms to be made about this magazine , i can think of only two : the lack of articles geared toward startup businesses and the tendency of the magazine to highlight success stories that , while nice to read about , present personal success that is a little out of reach of most business owners . inc. is designed for small businesses that are already established and need some guidance for growth . this is fine , but i would like it a little better of there were more articles on getting a new business off the ground . and , every now and them the magazine goes off on a tangent and interviews someone who is very rich . again , this is ok , but i would prefer to read about ordinary people who are only moderately well- off because these stories and the individual level of success they portray are more realistic . still , inc. is a very good publication for small business owners . it provides some good , timely advice on how to help your young business grow and how to handle legal issues and concerns . the price to subscribe is low , too , making inc. magazine a must for owners of small , growing companies .
0	please see tj-mccarthy 's review elsewhere here ; he is , to borrow a phrase from across the pond , spot-on in his comments . just this week i cancelled my 10-year subscription to pc magazine . one thing not mentioned elsewhere is that the new editor , jim louderback , has dropped the old tagline on the front cover , `` an independent guide to technology '' . i conjecture that the reason for doing so is that this magazine is no longer independent and is , in fact , just a marketing vehicle for various products . if you are like me and you do not like stealth marketing , stay away from this publication
1	the author of the declaration of independence and promoter of a bill of rights for the u.s. constitution , thomas jefferson once wrote : `` i read no newspaper now but ritchie 's , and in that chiefly the advertisements , for they contain the only truths to be relied on in a newspaper . '' [ letter to nathaniel macon , january 12 , 1819 ] the nation is not a newspaper . rather it is a weekly compilation of informed opinion and investigative reportage that reports what the main stream press and infotainment tv does n't dare to . those americans whose minds have been addled by a steady stream of ideological propaganda and lies call the nation `` left wing , '' `` liberal , '' `` radical , '' etc. , etc . plato had written 2,300 years ago his allegory of the cave : `` behold ! human beings living in an underground den , which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den ; here they have been from their childhood , and have their legs and necks chained so that they can not move , and can only see before them , being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads . '' plato 's `` punchline '' was `` ... and if he is compelled to look straight at the light , will he not have a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take refuge in the objects of vision which he can see , and which he will conceive to be in reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him ? '' and so , dear reader the nation is filled with sunlight that too many americans can not stand to look into directly . it is much less painful for them simply to say : `` ... the nation 's political bias is so far to the left that it repeatedly errors in its evaluations of the american and world - situation . '' for those who wish to know the simple truth of what is going on in america and the world read the nation . it prints the patriotic , incisive truth .
1	i was so happy to pick up meridian . it 's a great mix of fiction and poetry and i could n't put it down until i finished it

0	it took forever for this magazine to get to the address and it also is shipped a week to 2 weeks after the magazine is already on the stands . what 's the point of having a subscription if you get the magazine later than everyone else ? i will never order a magazine from amazon again , i 'll go through the actual magazine company instead
1	this magazine is a must have for professional poets

0	frst of all i kno nothin bout this magazine but wen i came across readin this kids review sayin tat yayos nd jeezys cd were garbage forced me to write a review ... frst of all yayos cd has at least 4 hits on it.. - so seductive - eastside westside - pimpin - curious - i know you do n't love me - live by the gun and for jeezy 's album i admit there wasnt as many hits if any but the cd was one of the best albums tat came out this year w/ a new flow of southern rap and a lot of good songs ... .trapstar..my hood..bang ft t.i ... .thug motivation ... .and then what ... all good songs ... im not sayin jeezy is one of the best rappers or at the top not close..but if he comes up w/ a new album better than thug motivation 101 he will be up thea cuz of his new flow of souther rap and high energ
1	i love entertainment weekly . this is a magazine that has everything current ... outline of plot , reviews for movies , music , tv , dvds , books . it keeps you current . it is the one magazine that i go through from cover to cover
0	psychology today purports to deliver the latest trends in psychological studies to the layman , but what it really delivers is pop psychology and a whole lot of advertisements . i give the magazine one star for a very snazzy layout , and a second star for hiring writers that do n't insult the reader 's intelligence by abusing alliteration ( unlike another magazine supposedly aimed at intelligent adults ) . however , the content is consistently concerned more with pop culture than with the lives of real people . i have also noticed a bias against introverts in article after article that attacks shyness as a serious character defect , rather than simply a personality trait ( so , introverts , if you want to avoid yet another lecture on how your way of relating to the world is intrinsically wrong , avoid this rag )
1	this subscription is the way to go if you are sick and tired of finding the last copy of q magazine for sale on the newstands is missing the 'enclosed ' cd because some chump has stolen it before you could . this rock music magazine is superior to others on the market , in my opinion , because it has excellent production values , i.e . luxuriantly thick and glossy paper and high quality reproductions . as a bonus , the writing is superior and highly imaginative . an expecial favorite section of mine is the 'man on the streets ' section in the back where concert goers are canvassed for their opinions on the show they have just watched . i like it because the reporter is sure to get a good cross-section of the audience and it clues one in on the reaction different types of people have to the band . in addition , this magazine covers us and worldwide bands that may not be as well-known here in the usa as they are in uk ; often these are bands that we might want to know better . the reviews section is always great , and usually the magazine will highlight a mini-section e.g . 'best r & amp ; b albums from the 1970 's , in which lost gems are rediscovered for the reader who may be too young to remember or even know about these artists . this magazine will have you finding , buying and liking albums by bands you 've never heard of , and who can beat the home delivery aspect for nickels more than the newstand price
0	i 've been a people subscriber for 2 years now i quite agree with the majority of reviewers ... same celebrities , different week . if it is n't tomkat/kitten , it 's branjelina or benifer 2 . oh , and we can not forget `` mrs. oops , i did it again '' spears-federline . very little on real people/human interest stories anymore , very little ... as for the actual magazine , it seems i 've become , through no choice of my own , one of people 's quality control employees . after subscribing , i informed customer service of my allergy to their scented inserts . i was told a note would be made to my account and i would no longer receive inserts in my magazine . here is where my job of qc employee came in , with my having to remove these inserts several times the first year , then again the second year in which i made another call to customer service . they apologized . stated there was a note on my account regarding my request then they offered to extend my subscription for two more weeks . next problem and part of my `` new '' job requirements ... reassembling my magazine . i received at least 4 or 5 issues of people put together either backwards , upside down or with half of the magazine in the front the other half flipped over in back . in order to read and enjoy these issues , i had to remove the staples , try and rearrange the pages then line the pages up by the staple holes to reinsert the staples . again i called customer service to complain . again they apologized then offered to extend my subscription another 2 weeks . i 've since written to cancel my subscription . i 've not heard a word back from people inc. , regarding this . we 'll see how it turns out
0	this magazine comes with lots of advertisements - 70 % or more . plus , articles ( less than 15 articles in every issue ) in the magazines are not very useful . i subscribed the magazine because it is inexpensive and it is rated high by other subscribers . now i realize i made a mistake .
1	i 've been a faithful subscriber to `` america 's civil war '' since 1993 , and i 'd say that it 's easily one of the best history-related magazines in existence . i read each issue cover-to-cover , even the letters to the editor . long after i first started studying the civil war almost 15 years ago , i 'm still learning a lot from this and other magazines like `` civil war times illustrated '' ( which is also great ) . in each issue of `` america 's civil war '' you can find a variety of articles in the following categories : personality ( which focuses on a specific soldier of officer ) , eyewitness to war ( great first-hand accounts from both soldiers and civilians ) , men and materiel ( weapons and equipment ) , reviews , commands ( focuses on individual units ) , preservation ( of artifacts and historic sites ) , and of course several articles which can cover a wide range of topics , from battles and leaders to politics and slavery . although i wish more would be written about the neglected western theater , i feel that the articles cover most aspects of the war very well . i love the artwork and outstanding maps that accompany the articles . and , `` america 's civil war '' is all about pleasing the readers . back in 1997 i mailed in a questionnaire from `` america 's civil war '' after writing that my favorite issue had a great article on the famous irish brigade . a few months later a new article on the irish brigade ( by the very same author ) appeared in their magazine and i was very impressed by this . bottom line : if you are a civil war buff this magazine is just what you need
1	i have been very pleased with family handyman since receiving my first copy . the featured articles are particularly well done . i especially like how each project they present is well photographed and labeled . if you want a monthly installment of ideas and guidance that will really help you learn and execute some great home improvement projects give family handyman a try
1	as with any profession or avocation or just down right fun habit , it is only as good as the tools you use . this magazine helps you keep up with the latest in the knitting world while still offering traditional patterns and methods . there are lots of glossy shots of fibers and models with well defined patterns and suggestions . you can find many great ads and reviews of other reading material .
1	to the defunct and much missed armchair detective magazine . comparisons aside , strand is the best of a large group that range from glossy to fanzines newsletters covering the mystery genre . very enjoyable ! ! and do n't sell some of them short either ! john row in1ea
1	i have not yet received my issue of creating keepsakes . i have viewed previous issues at stores and have enjoyed all the creative ideas and layouts .
1	muse is one of my all-time favorite magazines . i 'm 15 ( which is above the recommended age ) and i still enjoy it . one of my favorite activities is learning and my other favorite is reading . with muse i can do both at once . what more could i ask ? i do n't know what that midwest educator is on , but i recommend you stay away from it , kids . it ca n't be good for you if it turns you against muse
0	i trashed the issue when i saw the shot of trashy paris hilton . there is enough nudity already in your publication and seeing that sad piece of work ( her ) on the cover just turned me off completely . sorry you thought her 'cover worthy ' . probably missed some fine articles . sincerely : deane everett
1	`` discipleship journal '' does what many other christian magazines do not do . it provides instruction , and challenges the reader to be directly and fully engaged in a christ-focused faith . while others may talk about christianity , dj asks you to pursue christ through responding to scripture . this is n't an evangelistic magazine , like `` decision , '' or an encouraging magazine , per se , like `` moody . '' it is for the christian looking to grow in his or her faith by examining themselves and what god 's word says . it is not for the passive pew sitter . this for the christian who wants his or her faith to impact the days between sundays . there is nothing watered-down here . it is published by navpress , who , like their counterparts , the college ministry navigators , know the crucial necessity of biblical study by the everyday christian . whether it is a discussion about satan 's favorite lies , how to study a particular book of the bible , or an explanation of what prayer is an is not , dj is the sort of publication that will cause you to pause mid-page and realize something new about our lord and his ways . this is a great tool for two or three people to use together . even a small group ... to go through the articles , week by week and discuss them and what this means in real life . i 've even heard of ccd and sunday school classes asking everyone to read selections from a certain issue as fodder for the next week 's class . i fully recommend `` discipleship journal . '' expect your faith to grow . anthony trendl editor , hungarianbookstore.co
1	the author of the declaration of independence and promoter of a bill of rights for the u.s. constitution , thomas jefferson once wrote : `` i read no newspaper now but ritchie 's , and in that chiefly the advertisements , for they contain the only truths to be relied on in a newspaper . '' [ letter to nathaniel macon , january 12 , 1819 ] the nation is not a newspaper . rather it is a weekly compilation of informed opinion and investigative reportage that reports what the main stream press and infotainment tv does n't dare to . those americans whose minds have been addled by a steady stream of ideological propaganda and lies call the nation `` left wing , '' `` liberal , '' `` radical , '' etc. , etc . plato had written 2,300 years ago his allegory of the cave : `` behold ! human beings living in an underground den , which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den ; here they have been from their childhood , and have their legs and necks chained so that they can not move , and can only see before them , being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads . '' plato 's `` punchline '' was `` ... and if he is compelled to look straight at the light , will he not have a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take refuge in the objects of vision which he can see , and which he will conceive to be in reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him ? '' and so , dear reader the nation is filled with sunlight that too many americans can not stand to look into directly . it is much less painful for them simply to say : `` ... the nation 's political bias is so far to the left that it repeatedly errors in its evaluations of the american and world - situation . '' for those who wish to know the simple truth of what is going on in america and the world read the nation . it prints the patriotic , incisive truth .
1	i personally have always enjoyed reading time magazine long before i became politically aware . i started reading this magazine since i was in my adolescence.do i think it is liberal biased as some of the other reviewers claims that it is ? i do n't know and i do n't care . i do n't read it from a particular point of view . some of the cover stories in the past may be highly questionable given how shallow they might be but i do n't take it personally . one of the best articles i have read in a long time is the issue on high school drop outs . i thought that was quite thought provoking . i did n't think much of the 100 most influential people in the world list . katie couric ? ! c'mon . that woman is to hard journalism as paris hilton is to music . i wo n't even get into rachel ray . if people think time magazine is too liberal , then go read the national review . i do n't see time as hard journalism . half the stuff they publish is fluff pieces .
1	this is one of my favorite magazines , and the only magazine subscription i 've ever given as a gift . my list of recipients should tell you a lot about for whom this magazine is appropriate . i 've gifted the floss to my 73-year-old retired grandma , my 23-year-old writer sister , my 40-year-old trivia buff co-worker , and my 15-year-old high school sophomore cousin . you might call me lazy for using one gift to knock off a good portion of my christmas list , and you 're probably right . but there 's something in mental floss for everybody . i pick up a half-dozen conversational nuggets each month . i probably subscribe to 10 mags , and i 'd say this is the one i actually read every month . great stuff . my highest recommendation .
0	great for filling the doctors office magazine selection - if it 's free - but not worth your money to own . i bought if for gardening inspiration and there is really nothing about gardens or gardening in here . oh , once in a while they remember to put a garden shot in the magazine , but not consistently . the home section is n't that inspirational either . go for it if it 's free , but if it 's not , do n't buy it
1	this is not my favorite fitness magazine . this is the size of a reader 's digest , but is packed with ads just like a beauty magazine . i find this a bit disappointing considering the breadth of information they tend to cover . they share reasonable and attainable goals , and suggestions for us normal people . the magazine seems to cover a wide age group , with information that is good for both young and old . they do offer recipes , workout suggestions , and much more . the magazine takes little time to read , and seems to only serve as a springboard for more follow up on topics you enjoy . i think this is a better magazine to browse through at the supermarket than to purchase
1	five `` big apple '' stars ! ! new york magazine is a mind trip to new york city that anyone can take by sitting down for a brisk read of about an hour anywhere in the world . but it 'll take much longer to digest the detailed topical sections in the back portion of the magazine . and it covers everything : from a throughly researched , interesting , and eye-catching cover article , to departments that cover movies , the latest broadway play reviews , the night clubs , and a restaurant and club section 'that goes on and on ' . i can literally plan forays into the 'big apple ' using this magazine , from the latest trendy hotel , the latest 'unique ' meal in an established or a new reataurant , the newest on or off broadway play , art movie houses showing great independent movies that you probably wo n't find anywhere else in the us outside of los angeles , what artist is appearing at what jazz or rock club and the times of the shows , `` cover '' or `` no cover '' , etc , etc , etc . and yes , tons of glitzy ads . it 's just a `` new york state of mind '' in a magazine that you can use to plan a physical trip or just mentally take the trip . and it will keep you up to date on the current issues in the city . new york magazine sets the standard for all of those other city and state magazines . i love new york city and i love new york magazine . five big stars !
0	i would like to rate this magazine with at least a good rating but that is not possible since i have never received my subscription . i have waited over 4 months since i first paid . i have called and was told i would get a call back telling me when i could expect to start getting it but never did get the call nor the magazine . that was 4 weeks ago . if you want to find out about this magazine go somewhere else . it is not here and no telling if it will ever be here
1	i like getting good stuf in the mail and one day i received this mag from my grandma and i really enjoyed it , seeing as i had just enter hi skool and there we tons of things i wasnt real sure on ... however my mom discontinued it , saying i was too young for it ... many reviewers say this , so i will say what many of them fail to specify : this magazine is geared more for girls who have entered the high-school , teenager period , and deals alot with makeup and boys , a bit of fashion , and keeping close to your friends . i will take a stab at saying its mostly for teens , if not for the younger ones , ages 15 and up ... but realy , dating and makeup are things a girls will decide on when shes ready ... i have neither dated , nor wore makeup , and im an older girl , and the only reason i am more interested in boys and trying to put on eyeshadow is age-curiousity ... the mag has not affected me in any way ... except provide a few hours worth of reading and quiz-taking , plus help on everyday worries ( ie , body , social probs , and so forth ) great mag if you know you have a mature daughter who doesnt change overnite to please people at skool ... age isnt the real big issue if u are maturer ( 15 and up , or have just matured 5x faster than most girls ur age ) and want a mag that is more real life than just made up stories ( they have a fiction section ) , more diverse girls ( all kinds of body types and ethnicities ) , and all around more mature theme , pick up seventeen ... its a great mag , but parents beware ... is talks about sex and has real life stories that can be very disturbing ... just to warn u ... my rents didnt realy like it , but if ur well rounded and have good morals , u realy need not worry ... see y
1	i am not a big magazine reader -- never have been , never really had time to ! however , a friend of mine at work kept bringing me copies of this magazine to read ... after falling in love every time read it i finally i had to get a subscription of my own ! this magazine covers everything ! it 's got tips for life , cooking , decorating , organzing , and getting the best deal for your money . a lot of the stuff in here -- shortcut cooking ideas , for instance , are stuff that i use and apply to my normal life . for example : the july 2006 issue has a dessert shortcut for peach cobbler . the result of that recipe was a wonderful dessert for my family of four that took me ... less than 15 minutes to prepare and tasted great ! they do n't endorse products nearly to the same degree that most magazines do , and when they do it 's in an article where they had comparisons done ... always a recommendation , and usually more than one . the important thing here is they do n't say `` buy this product '' they say `` buy products that have such and such feature , make sure it has this in it for silky smooth hair , and oh here 's an example of what we 're talking about . '' they make you an informed shopper instead of just throwing products at you withotu reason or rhyme . so , in conclusion , if you 're like me and can use a few extra ideas about everything in your life ... this is a great magazine . the information is helpful , applicable to normal everyday life ... and it 's not so full of ads that you want to choke the advertisers
1	overall , this is the best gaming magazine i have read . it covers all consoles , gives sensible ( and funny ) reviews , and previews the hottest upcomming games . most games are reviewed by two people , adding to the accuracy of the score . it has a rating of 1-10 , 10 being the best , a rating which precious few games recieve . the previews section gives you a sneek peek of upcomming games . some of them are one page long , some ten . they all include pictures , and most have an estimated release date . also , there is a section on news in the game industry . ususlly near the beginning of the magazine , they include news on developers , consoles , and the big names in the industry . all in all , this is a great magazine , and well worth your money , because each issue is well over 100 pages
0	i got this magazine as a gift , starting a few months back . i really ca n't say i 'm impressed . admittedly , i 'm much more left leaning than this conservative ( sometimes very , very conservative ) magazine . dispite my bias , i can still recognize good writing and well made points - this magazine generally lacks both . this is n't to say that i 've never seen a good point or anything , they 're just fairly rare . if you want to read a well-written , well-argued , conservative mag this is n't it
0	this magazine used to be very thorough , and it used to be very good at providing me with tons of deals and tips that i never would have found on my own . it was great , and very opinionated . but last year sometime , they changed the look of it and now there 's a lot less text . it 's much more a style magazine now , and that 's not what i want in a travel magazine that i have bought to tell me about money saving ! worse , except for the 40 best vacation bargains , which are still okay , most of the articles forget to incluce a lot of money-saving tips and instead they too often suggest i do expensive things . since when is a $ 225 a night hotel considered budget ? ? the headlines and captions are expecially smart-aalecky . it 's not as good with the expert advice as it used to be ! i noticed that arthur frommer is n't editing it anymore which maybe is why -- bring him back ! my search for a true money-saving travel magazine has unfortunately resumed again
0	as someone who is very interested in healthy eating and living , i was actually appalled by this magazine . it is ostensibly health conscious , but upon closer examination it ignores important health information . for example , in one issue , it had a whole article about diabetes and how , thanks to the miracles of science , diabetics can now eat sugary foods . it proceeded to give a table of artificial sweeteners explaining when to use which . a truly health conscious person would know that aspartame is suspected of causing cancer , and that the only real way to avoid diabetes is to only include a reaonable and moderate amount of sugar in your diet . i was disappointed with the magazine
1	i love this magazine great travel ideas , and fun to read even if you never make the trip ! a recent issue on the yucatan really helped make our vacation there so much more interesting . we visted ruin sites we would have never seen other wise . this magazine and `` tourist in the yucatan '' ( thriller/adventure ) really made my vacation special
0	i just cancelled my subscription and recommended that my daughter cancel the one i bought for my 14 year-old grandson . for some reason ziff-davis marketers think that full page ads selling sex videos are appropiate for pc magazine . ( dec 27 , 2005 , p 122 if you want to check it out ) . previous issues had partial page ads selling `` sex pheremones '' which i could almost overlook , but full pages scantily clad lap dancers is over the line .
1	i was a loyal reader for many years , and i 've always been very impressed by their insightful , deep investigations into various scandals and national political events . they _always_ knew more than the newspapers . they 've been just excellent , very well-written , and i always felt like they could back up their opinions and their open and earnest political biases right to the 6th level of abstraction , so to speak . their pursuit of the objective truth , whether their target has been bush or the dnc , has earned my respect . the new republic kept investigating and muckracking while over the last decade major news institutions have one by one become purveyors of infotainment and pre-digested pablum . my sense is that with media consolidation and various new press liability laws , news sources have become air-tight and we 've been getting our news from company pr flacks and lobbyist firms with agendas . in this environment the real investigative work becomes like gold . middle-brow types read time , but the writers at time and others who want real knowledge and context on what is happening on the ground all read the new republic . the magazine has been vastly more influential than it 's 100k+ circulation # 's would imply . but..the new republic was _for_ the war in iraq , despite their natural antipathy towards bush , which i share . i have n't read them lately - i 'm sure they 're appalled at how things have gone over there . the magazine has never been a cluster of soft peaceniks usually associated with the left , but here i feel like they 've let loose their inner hawks given bush the benefit of the doubt ( always the _wrong_ decision ) .. so what does that make them..quasi-neocons ? utopians ? dupes ? they 're often much too closely focused on israel , and this also may have clouded their thinking ..along with colin powell 's great song-and-dance at the u.n. last year . i felt i needed to try something new . lately i 've been reading the new yorker reason ( it 's right-of-center doppelganger ) some other magazines , but i still think the new republic is an excellent source of news and very worthwhile . definately - you should buy an issue on the news stand try it out
0	i am a low income disabled person and require copious amounts of bathroom reading material , 'wired ' is even too tedious to fill that need . its sponsors tend to run the lengthy ads reminiscent of old picture filled national geographics of questionable scientific value . on the other hand the articles , for example in the latest issue , 'are higher gas prices good for us ' ( paraphrase of title ) offer little information and if i had time to do the research this one is particularly like a sheaf of 1970 nixon press releases in conjunction with the announced operation independance . the intention at the time was to free the u.s. from dependance on foriegn oil . oh we of short memory , condemned to sacrifice our sons and now daughters ! of interest may be the dumb means by which i obtained an unending subscription to this and some other almost as pointless magazines , playstation magazine - now x box magazine , the completely amoral men 's health , garden club , cooking . i simply check the highest income level on every form i fill out on the internet and everything else short of a tax form or loan application . typical of something recieved for nothing wired is not a publication for which i would recommend laying out any money or time . including bathroom time .
0	this magazine is great just for keeping the spirit . it 's filled with many success stories . but hardly any of those success stories include the details that led them into success . it 's also extremely geared towards franchising . every other article , and every other ad is about franchising . i have a one year subscription and at this point i 'm bored . i 'll keep the subscription , but it 's highly unlikely that i will renew next year . *** though one should check out their web site at entrepreneur.com . you will find that it is the total opposite of the magazine , and will prove to be a great wealth of information
0	look at the price of this magazine ! over $ 30 for 6 magazines ! i once read one of these magazines at the library and i hated it ! there were no articles about celebrities , tv , music , or beauty . there were some good advice questions in this , but it did n't give any advice for them ! it said , `` find the answers to these questions in the next issue of new moon . '' also , in the mail bag , someone wrote , `` why did n't you put martin luther king day on your calendar ? '' they wrote back , `` sorry , this magazine is only about girls and women . '' this magazine is really anti-male and disses girls that act like normal teenagers . if you want to get a good magazine , try girls life for almost half the price that new moon is
0	this magazine is not for the average car buyer . they might as well call this the robb report . they only test highend cars and the `` best '' ones are the ones that go 0-60mph the quickest , not ride nice or get good mpg
1	i was on vacation in miami last december and picked-up a copy of this magazine-bw.it is the best photographic magazine i have ever seen or read.it is the best tribute to black and white photography as an art form . the prinitng quality is equally as superb and highly compliments the new technology in printing.it gives new meaning to the words photo finish . unfortunately the magazine is only avaliable in the united states so i have had to subscribe using my son 's address in miami . it has inspired me to further improve my work as an artist , photographer , who considers black and white photography as the only true art form and dismisses digital photography as not being photography . norris hall , belmopan , belize , central america
0	( i sent the following letter to their customer service last week ) after about 15 years of getting your magazine , i have decided not to renew my subscription . it is a shame that your once great publication has become such a joke . after receiving your november issue , and spending 10 minutes removing all the inserts and gimmick ads so i could actually read it , i found no substance . instead there is a fashion section ( yikes ) , a `hot list ' with young barely dressed men and women ( hey i 'm not against a little sex and skin , but i 'll subscribe to vogue or maxim for that ) , an article about larry david 's wife that might as well have come from people magazine , an aussie travelogue that i am convinced their tourist board paid for , all sandwiched in between so many ads for monster suvs and other crap that you need a compass and a map just to keep up with where the articles worth reading continue from one page to the next . what happened to the great writers like krakauer ? what happened to having any environmental conscience ? where are the stories of adventure that are real and make you want to go there ? maybe i am just getting older than your current demographic . i have n't lost my sense of adventure , which is why i live in durango co and spend a lot of time outdoors . i used to look to your magazine for inspiration . now i half expect the cover to tout stories on `killer abs ' . you 've become the clear channel of the outdoor magazine world . get real again and i may come back
0	i ordered kiplingers and us news on march 25 and was immediately charged for both subscriptions . today is october 12th and i 've never received us news . i 've complained several times and been given a variety of excuses and promised a refund and free subsciption which of course i have n't received . when i requested a refund of course i was given the wrong amount . if you want to order magazines i agree with the last reviewer go to another site because while amazon is great for books that have n't got the magazine business straight . also , the customer service phone numbers are wrong and this is a total mess .
1	harper 's is easily my second favorite fashion magazine , second only to instyle . it is great and packed with great fashion . it actually does have some good articles too that i thoroughly enjoy reading . ( the articles are much better than the ones in elle . ) if you can only get one sub , get instyle . if you can get two , get instyle and harper 's bazaar . it is well-worth the money
1	the smartest , best-informed , and most , well , entertaining writing about entertainment and popular culture . i read it cover to cove
1	i highly recommend highlights for children . it 's a great way for children to begin reading in a very fun way . watch your child 's eyes read with delight as they have fun with puzzles , hidden pictures , games , and fun and entertaining stories . cynthia marie rizzo , author of julie and the unicorn
0	once upon a time this was a good magazine worth reading cover to cover . unfortunately they 've slowly been replacing content with more and more advertising . as the magazine currently stands you could probably finish reading the actual `` content '' in about an hour . the rest is advertising and bs . this magazine jumped the shark a long long time ago . just let it die already like it 's supposed to
1	this is an excellent magazine . my young son has been recieving this magazine and has enjoyed it every month . it provides factual information in an interesting format . it has lovely pictures . there are stories , crafts and games that all teach about one main theme with the over lapping idea being all about nature . it is educational and yet it is not boring or overwhelming wtih facts and figures . it is great for the age 7-10 crowd .
1	no doubt , wired is one of the best tech magazines in print , but the subscription for wired for amazon is apparently managed by a company called synapse . i subscribed for a year 's subscription in july and my first issue did not turn up even by mid november . i had to call and cancel my subscription . i now subscribe directly
1	it 's true that entrepreneur mag is loaded with ads -- but those ads can be interesting in themselves . i always find it fascinating to see what ads pop and what ads are junk -- and it 's easy to see the difference . this is an opportunity to develop your own advertising strategy ! as for the content , there is certainly room for improvement . i personally enjoy the entrepreneur profiles , though i wish they were longer . i would like to see more meat here . having been in business for several years now , i find the most value in this magazine comes from the front section where they list interesting tips , new products , and survey results . not a month goes by that i do n't bookmark a page so i can follow up on a new product or check out a website mentioned in a short piece . for that alone , the low subscription price is worth the investment . there is a lot of information on franchising , which is great for those interested in this business model . though this is not my personal cup of tea , i still find it interesting to read the lists of franchises and notice the trends in popularity . who knew there were so many pet service franchises available ! sure , it could use more real-world advice , but i still consider this one of the best general magazines available for entrepreneurs . not every topic can appeal to every reader since we all run different kinds of businesses and seek different information . if you 're looking for something more specific to your industry , a trade magazine would make more sense . but i still recommend you keep your entrepreneur mag too so you can keep an eye on the climate of the small biz world .
1	this magazine single-handedly taught me how to dress with style- and believe me- that 's no small feat . i love how lucky shows how to put pieces together to look fabulous without mindlessly following the crowd . if that 's all i had interest in , then i could 've simply bought the lucky shopping guide book . but their reviews of up and coming clothing and jewelry designers , hair , makeup , home decor , and the `` how i 'm wired '' sections keep me coming back to the magazine . plus the lucky breaks are awesome . my only complaint is the average price of their featured raved-about items . what lucky is for me is a fantastic template for fashion and style that i can use to find similar items at cheaper prices in stores like h , target , etc . it 's so worth the $ 12/year , and i look anxiously at the beginning of each month for its arrival in my mailbox
0	articles were n't anything new . mostly fluff and cosmetic/clothes ads . better info and exercises in oxygen and women 's m
1	this is one of the many different magazines that you can find at discount or grocery stores with lots of hairstyle pictures . this particular magazine is about 60 % color pictures . at least the issues i 've bought were . this is something you would buy if you wanted a new hairstyle that would involve a new cut . a majority of the styles in these magazines are shoulder length styles and above . this is a nice item to have in a hair salon for clients to get ideas while they wait . since this magazine is pictures of celebrities you can also use it to keep track of their hairstyle changes
0	after 1 month i have n't receive the product . it 's to give a good review until it arrives
1	my wife brought a copy of strand home yesterday . the editorial and production quality look excellent . the personality interview , scholarly article and the short stories are very good . i plan to subscribe
1	most of the beautiful gardens i see are in washington or oregon or back east somewhere . having lived in washington , i do enjoy seeing some of the plants that i am missing here in colorado , but it would be nice to see a more varied selction of gardens becasue we all ca n't live in the pacific northwest . i have a subscription to sunset so i guess that will have to suffice , but i do wish bh would take that into consideration . otherwise , i love this magazine . i used to get several magazines , but this was always my favorite . it is chock full of ideas that we can really use . and i love the photography . what sets bh apart is that you can see a hint of life in these beautiful houses . slippers on the floor , newspaper on the table and often the owners of the home are in the pictures too . they are sometimes blurred from movement which is actually nicer than a posed shot . it helps set the feeling that this home is lived in and is attainable . i would say get this magazine right away . i would have given it 5 stars except for the whole garden thing .
0	disney , just about the worst company on earth , has many lines of magazines . this is just used to suck even more money , even though they already have so much money that they 're kids drown to death in money . then disney goes on to cancel dave the barbarian and teacher 's pet , the only good disney shows
1	the high price is predominately due to the shipping costs as this magazine is produced in the united kingdom . a subscription over there runs about twenty bucks . however , even with the added expense to get this delivered stateside , icreate is a great looking magazine with excellent editorials . top-notch magazine and highly recommended . just wish imagine publishing would recognize the potential of this product and start producing this , as-well-as a few other of their excellent magazines , here in the states
0	let me first say i am one of martha stewart 's biggest fans ! i have enjoyed msl magazine for years and loved the format of the `` old '' show ( the new one is taking awhile to get used to ) . i jumped at body and soul when it first came out , but have been repeatedly disappointed in the obvious exclusion of anything `` male '' in the articles . not to mention , the articles on relationships and love have never mentioned same sex partners which i find totally unacceptable , unforgivable , and just plain stupid from a marketing standpoint . why exclude men and gay people ? i have also noticed there are no ads from advertisers marketing to men either . most if not all of the articles are nothing more than `` new age '' pablum , either `` borrowed '' or stolen from much better magazines such as alternative medicine . do n't waste your time or money on this one . this is n't even good enough to line my cat 's litter box
1	i have been a subscriber to family fun for 4+ years and i have always enjoyed the magazine . i do n't remember ever being disappointed in an issue . i usually will read a magazine once just for entertainment value and then go back later and sort out the articles ideas i want to keep on file for future reference . in most magazines this equates to a few pages to hang on to at the most . with family fun i always end up with a huge stack of ideas that i want to hang on to . what is even better is that these are tips and bits of information that i actually use and apply in our everyday lives . practical , useful and fun are all words i would use to describe this publication . my favorite features include : `` my great idea '' - submitted by readers `` family almanac '' - seasonal activities and resources and the travel ideas . we have discovered many great places that our on our list to visit someday and we have even been able to add some wonderful and educational fun to trips we have already had planned . some reviews have complained about the magazine being owned by disney . i 'm not sure why that is such a problem , but i do realize some people do n't like disney . the truth is that some major corporation owns just about everything major magazine out there anyway . at least the disney company has helped family fun gain a bigger audience and provided a fantastic web site as a resource companion to the magazine . i do n't find that disney is overly promoted ( a rarity in the world of disney i know ! ) in this magazine . there are plenty of reviews and references to very non-disney products such as the harry potter series , shrek movies , and hundreds of travel ideas that have nothing to do with anything related to a disney enterprise . this magazine has definitely earned the 5 star rating
0	this magazine shows the negative side of black men . i find the magazine an embarrasement to the african-american community . it seems out of all the races of men in the world , black men seem to want to display their lack of self control , their love of fancy cars , overpriced clothes , which in no way helps create wealth in our communities . and i am also offended that this magazine rarely shows black women on the front cover . until , black men understand that this kind of pathetic display of supposed masculinity is stopped , they will always be stopped by the police , be passed over for employment , and looked down upon . i wish someone would create a magazine for black men which shows the positive side of being a black man such as being leaders in their community , showing respect and love for their women , and showing that everything is not hip hip !
0	the heft and page quality of this magazine is impressive , but it 's mostly advertising . very disappointing . it does have some useful info and i do enjoy reading it ( which is why it got 2 stars from me ) , but i definitely wo n't be renewing my subscription
0	on the whole , bicycling is a huge disappointment . i agree with some writers that the occassional tidbits of information are good , but i do n't pay for a subscription for a sidebar or two -- i read those in the newstand . further , as i will mention below , once and a while there is a real gem of an article . in the meantime , almost everything else they do is poor . the entire magazine is pitched at the readership as though we were all budding pros , training obsessively and fighting with that last 1 % of body fat . the reality is , what bicycling 's readership principally is is rich -- in their own pages , they recently listed average household income of a subscription at $ 115,000 . so it 's not people with the ability tor ride like the pros ride , it 's people with the ability to buy what the pros ride . the result is a majority of articles and reviews that focus on just this -- $ 3000+ bikes ( and , as one reviewer said , the occassional review of more reasonably priced choices around $ 1500 . wait , $ 1500 is *not* chump change ? ! ? ! ) , advanced training and eating techniques , etc. , as opposed to real world riding -- centuries and club rides , touring , commuting ( gasp ! ) , etc . even it 's racing coverage is terrible -- its recent spread on the san fran gp , one of the three most important races in the us , was 6 pages of photos , 4 of which were of people watching the race , not the racing itself . for me , though , the worst part is its hypocrisy . in a recent issue , there was a truly excellent article on what the author called `` invisible riders '' -- low income laborers who depended on their cheap bicycles to get them to and from work sites everyday . yet : the author mentioned several times ( albeit with embarrassment ) that he was riding a seven while doing research on people whose lives depended on $ 100 bikes ; the author commented on the significance of these riders commuting everyday , a movement which riders like bicycling readers had never been able to mobilize ( maybe because they all drive to work and the magazine does little or nothing to encourage bicycle commuting ) ; and the five bikes reviewed in that issue ranged from $ 3500- $ 7000 . really , really sad . one star for `` invisible riders '' and the like , and that 's it
1	for $ 10 a year , at least i can look at a magazine that is n't dominated by spongebrand squarepants or dora the commercialized explorer and that realizes not every parent thinks the disney princess pastel hegemony is the only way to go for a nursery . will i pay $ 200 for a sweater ? very doubtful , but if i did it would be something i could pass down as an heirloom . true , i may spend more per item on my daughter 's clothes and toys than most , but i also limit the number of things she does receive . i 'd rather spend $ 100 on one unique toy i found in cookie than give her twenty pieces of plastic at $ 5 a pop from some toy megapolis . cookie covers quality over quantity , style over branding , modern over mainstream and for that i 'm grateful
0	although i found the magazine itself to be interesting and colorful , with a good series of articles on marriage and relationships , i found that customer service was very dissapointing . i missed an issue back in october , and have contacted customer service 3 times to have them resend the issue i missed . it is now march , and i still have n't received my replacement . just a heads up !
0	do not ! ! order from this website ! i purchased a subscription for oxygen magazine on jan. 30 , 2006 , and i still have not received the first issue . i am very dissapointed , to say the least !
1	men 's health is one of the most popular men 's magazines because it meets the various expectations and needs of the modern man . you simply have to know about fitness , dieting , supplements , fashion , gadgets , etc . the annual subscription makes it a bargain and you get so much information for a few bucks . one of the most interesting sections is the one dedicated to bedroom activities . the tips are definitely useful and yet i highly recommend in addition the bestseller `` scientifically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex '' for the latest secrets in this area . another key feature of the magazine is that it motivates you to stay healthy , lean and fit . there are weight loss tips , advice on how to eat and exercise in order to see results fast . this is important part of keeping sharp appearance . overall , i can reasonably say that you will learn a lot , have fun reading it and most probably it will help you up to a certain limit to be a good looking man and great lover .
0	this is definitely the inferior rag of the big trio of science monthlies . filled with poorly-written articles . i actually went back to home depot once to get a refund for this magazine . it is indeed worth the gas and time to get a refund if you actually pay for this magazine . this magazine promotes commercial products , and no i 'm not talking about the advertisements , but the actual articles themselves . the magazine is not a news magazine , it is just one big advertising rag where manufacturers have paid to get in . if you like paying for ads , go for it
1	there 's a lot to like about lenswork - the selection of images , the quality of the printing , bill jay 's `` end notes '' - but the thing i like the most is that there is almost no discussion of equipment . brooks jensen ( the editor/publisher ) does n't appear to care what camera you used to make a photograph , or how many miles through a raging blizzard you hiked to make it . all that matters is the image . and after you 've finished looking at the images , you 'll find a lot of wisdom and practical information packed into each issue , too . highly recommended
0	time magazine named george bush as person of the year , despite the economic , international and ecological damage he has done and will continue to do over the next four years . speak and be heard . cancel your subscription .
1	i love this magazine ! it has up to the minute , need to know celeb news . honestly most of the time what they say in these `` tabloid '' magazines turns out to be true- jessica simpson split , and brad and angelina , jen and vince , just to name a few ... .also there 's movie/dvd/music reviews , makeup and fashion tips , and the clothes they have in there are affordable so you can dress like your favorite celeb . i look forward to each week getting this magazine
0	this magazine was given to us as a gift subscription when our son was born , but both my wife and i quickly tired of it . the previous review that pointed out their lack of scientific research in a good bulk of their advice and their tendency to misquote and distort studies is just plain irresponsible . the magazine seems to be firmly stuck in a fantasy 'pc ' world of lofty goals and ideals for your children that have very little real world application . articles about disciplining your children that read along the lines of 'if your 2 year old hits his brothe rin the face with a soccer ball , look him straight in the face , make eye contact and tell him that it is not nice to hit ' . thanks for that pearl of wisdom . anyone with a 2 year old can atest to the futility of reasoning with them . never would parents magazine advocate something that might actually work like say taking all of his toys away and marching his butt to the corner where he gets to stand for say 9 years or until he is adopted by the neighbors : ) seriously , the magazine writes for a fantasy land scenario where june and ward are the parents and the kids act like the munchkins on a disney tv movie . if you happen to be the cleavers , go for it..
0	i used to enjoyed discover , but the past several months of their radicals changes , got me to think a real dumbing down.once in awhile , they would put together a good article - but not constantly.how can we enlighten ourselves and improve our intelligence on science etc in the world stage.there are still many of us that do not want to be glued to the computer for science as we would for the tv.discover 's editorial staff ought to get their magazine back on track or the circulation and subscriber base is going to go down the tube . thank goodness scientific american , astronomy , sky and telescope , science news havent fallen down.i am not renewing my subscription unless discover 'rediscovers ' itself.how dumb americans are !
0	when i first heard there was an american version of l'uomo vouge i was really excited . i thought `` finally an american men 's fashion magazine that 'll be edgy , risky , creative original ! '' i could n't have been more wrong . this magazine is virtually indistinguishable from lackluster men 's magazines gq , esquire details . european men 's fashion magazines are works of art with cutting edge photography , bold reporting beautiful advertising . you wo n't find any of this in men 's vouge . the editors of this magazine have greatly insulted the intelligence of american readers . if i could i 'd give this magazine a negative 5
1	great conservative political journalism . would 've liked to read it when william buckley was editor
0	i wish that when i purchased this subscription i would have read all of the reviews . unlike the description included on the amazon website , the subsription does not include the cd-rom , which costs an additional $ 1/issue . and , if you want to purchase the cd-roms for past issues , they cost $ 4/disk . sometimes a bargain is n't really a bargain . buyer beware
0	i ordered the magazine and immediately received my first issue , but unfortunately over the course of the year i only received a total of three issues ! the magazine is great , but i wonder what the problem is . i have no received much help from amazon or modern bride . guess i learned my lesson not to subscribe online anymore .
1	i 've been subscribing to plusa since 1984 , the same year i started powerlifting . it contains a wealth of information for the beginner to the elite lifter . interesting strength articles , interviews with the champions of the sport , results from meets , and the list of upcoming contests . it also contains all the different powerlifting vendors for your equipment needs . its a must to have this magazine for anyone into or starting out with powerlifting . its the original mag
0	i am also a longtime subscriber , and i am quite outraged at the new changes that have been made with the magazine . i have written a letter to the editor containing my list of grievances , if you will ( i would hope they would be redressed but they will probably ignore me ) . anyway , please read : i am a current subscriber , and was quite suprised by discover 's new look ( to all reading this review on amazon.com : amazon.com does not display the updated version of what discover currently looks like ) . i did n't quite care for it , but as long as the material stayed the same i was going to be allright with it . unfortunately , the articles in discover have degenerated into `` top 20 things you did n't know about ... '' lists , piles of trivia , some sexual humor and editorializing on recent news . sure , reading about gay astronauts may be a little humorous . is it appropriate for what discover stood for or what i have expected from this magazine ? i would disagree . occasionally there is an intelligent article . the cover story still seems up to par with the stories from the old discover . i really did once enjoy this magazine and it was the most expected item to arrive in my mailbox . i 've kept all my copies from the last five years in the best condition i possibly could because i truly did enjoy reading them , and still do . maybe this new discover is for a `` new generation '' or meant to lure in younger or less mature readers , but i think the change in articles has taken a turn for the worse . i think the ordinary person , the `` lay man '' if you will , would appreciate at least intelligent articles about new , interesting and groundbreaking discoveries in the scientific community . i remember the string theory article ( i forget which issue exactly ) as one of the most well-written articles on that topic.it was very exciting , and most importantly it [ i ] got me interested in the science [ /i ] . i doubt i will ever see anything that good from discover magazine again . i 'd really hate to give up on this magazine : all i ask is for the old discover back .
0	i hate this magazine . i subscribed sight-unseen based on the good reviews , and find the recipes are for food that no one in my house would ever eat ... way too exotic . if you like good ol ' american fare , do n't buy this one
1	science matters . you already know that . you want to stay on top of what 's happening in medicine , space research , earth studies , and more . that 's because you know things like aids , earthquakes , and changing weather patterns all have huge significance to human needs and social policy . but you do n't have the time or the specialized knowledge to plow through piles of academic journals every week , hunting the nuggets that mean the most and translating them into the language of normal , educated reader . you want science news . it 's brief and readable , so you do n't have to dedicate half your week to keeping up with what really matters . it 's weekly , which matters in a world where month-old news is old news . and it 's written so that any concerned citizen can understand the science and the issues . the editors do n't write down to the readers , but they do n't assume specialized education either . intelligent high-schoolers or precocious tween-agers can grasp the important parts of each story , but specialists ( including one university prof i know ) use it to keep up with news outside of their research areas . try a few issues at your local library - you 'll probably find that you 'll want your own . //wiredweir
1	i have read this mag thru and thru , and for some 20 + years now it has continued to be at the top of the crop . it is the most superbly laid out and designed magazine with excellant content , that i have ever seen . to be totally honest , i would much rather read and browse this any day over `` print '' magazine . this is almost like a graphic design book , that just gets published every 2 months where the best designers in the world are given each about 30 pages to just go nuts on . i found it deep in the stacks of the university library one day and have been hooked ever since ... also for those of you who can read/write japanese , german , and english you can have your pick while reading..
0	i have to agree with those who did n't care for it . the only thing i liked was one article written by a dad who was skateboarding with his son . it was witty , insightful and inspirational . the rest of the mag just seemed totally irrelevent to my life . it is aimed at people who dry-clean their childrens clothes . does anyone do that ? i do n't want my kids to be that concerned with clothes and money . the few issues i read made me mad and depressed . i 've never written a review before but felt compelled to do so regarding this lame magazine . give me break with that $ 400 cashmere hoodie for my son ! my son likes his vilified character t-shirts and that is what matters . he is not a reflection of my style , he is a reflection of his own . get over yourselves
1	no doubt , wired is one of the best tech magazines in print , but the subscription for wired for amazon is apparently managed by a company called synapse . i subscribed for a year 's subscription in july and my first issue did not turn up even by mid november . i had to call and cancel my subscription . i now subscribe directly
1	sports illustrated is a great magazine , the premier magazine for sports . the writing in it is spectacular as well as the clear and helpful visuals that go along with every article . to make this short , i highly recommend this a subscription for any sports fan -- it 's a great gift for a husband , boyfriend , or just any sports fan
1	my husband and i started with a free subscription to this magazine and fell in love with it . we both read it from cover to cover
1	after reading a few of the other reviews , i am again baffled by the left/liberal take on things . this is a conservative magazine ! ! liberals , open at your own risk ! you just might encounter a differing view point than you own ! goodness . the articles are informative , indepth , humorous , and thoughtful . it 's a good read .
1	excellent selection of recipes anyone can prepare , in just 30 minutes . no need to be out of ideas for any party or get together , just open the book to any page , and you 're set and ready to go , or should i say cook !
1	we subscribed to this magazine for our 7 year old . our 3 and 5 year olds like it as well . we all enjoy sitting down together to read it as soon as it comes in the mail . i enjoy flipping through it myself . you 're never to old to learn fun facts about nature ! ! a perfect gift
0	two months after ordering the magazine i have yet to receive a single issue
0	psychology today is just another glamour/cosmo/people disguised as a magazine discussing issues in psychology . this magazine used to be well-written and had more scientific data . however , since the appointment of the new editor , headlines became similar to that of tabloid magazines all over . if you are interested in scientific data and research , this is not the magazine for you . i used to subscibe to psychology today but stopped renewing since i took more psychology classes becuase i found out that the magazine had no new insights to offer in the field of psychology at all
0	i have received this magazine from it 's start and have always found it to be full of great recipies , however , the company that produces this magazine has horrible customer service . i have battled with them for over a year about a billing mistake on their part and they still have yet to make it right . i have cancelled all subscriptions with them and refuse to do business with them any longer . if you subscribe be very cautious about ordering any books from them
0	i 'd always heard about interesting articles in this magazine . but the mess of ads and people magazine gossip that lands ( with a big , heavy thud ) on my doorstep every month is the most worthless magazine i 've ever made the mistake of purchasing . it 's pretentious tripe aimed at a small group of nyc media insiders , self-regarding movie celebs , and those people who 'd like to be part of that world . even when they occasionally hit on a compelling subject , the writers are so narcissistic as to be truly repellent . it 'd be more accurate simply to cut `` fair '' out of the title
1	in touch is a weekly glossy magazines that retails at newstands for $ 1.99 . it is very similar to star and us weekly . they offer fodder on the hollywood flavor of the moment , so expect lots of stories about julia roberts , britney spears , brad pitt , jenifer aniston , j.lo and the usual suspects . it is very worth the newstand price . they rarely , if ever have human interest stories , most of the stories are all about celebrities , style , make-up , or fashion . they also have contests some times . a lot of times i notice they run the same stories and pictures as us weekly so if i had to choose between in touch and us weekly 1 year subscription is less i would choose us because it still seems like they get more exclusive stories that in touch . also , some of the news they run sometimes is weeks old , i often think they end up filling space close to print time . it 's an okay magazine an worth the cover price
0	i was gon na make a point , but fabz made it for me i was gon na say that nowadays an cd is considered tight just because it has a couple of hit singles and yayo 's hit singles werent really hits his songs were on the radio tv for probably about a month or two if thats what you call a hit then you crazy the fact is it takes more than 4 good songs to make a good cd he said that there were 4 hot songs on the album but failed to mention that there are 17 songs on the cd a couple of good songs dont make it good cd you want to see what other people think of the yayo album read the reviews for it and jeezy please he always been garbag
0	i can not review this item because a month later , i still have not received the first issue of my subscription . sorry frank caldero
1	vogue fantastic high fashion photos . if you love to look at beautiful clothing and shoes you need to look at vogue . however , as other reviews have indicated , the articles are quite lacking . they are often flat without much substance on topics that are frankly not interesting . so , you get vogue for the pictures . if your looking to ogle pretty clothes or for inspiration for an art project this is a great magazine , if you want something to read get something else
0	i would like to rate this magazine with at least a good rating but that is not possible since i have never received my subscription . i have waited over 4 months since i first paid . i have called and was told i would get a call back telling me when i could expect to start getting it but never did get the call nor the magazine . that was 4 weeks ago . if you want to find out about this magazine go somewhere else . it is not here and no telling if it will ever be here
0	there are very few serious articles in this magazine -- just tons of tidbits ( stats/facts/tips ) . by the time you get to the end it 's difficult to recall anything from the magazine ; it 's that shallow . occasionally there 's a good recipe , but that 's about it
1	this science magazine should be held as a standard for the intelligent general science minded person . articles are good , not overly technical in depth . at times it gets in its doldrums of articles , but generally it holds it own . you do n't have to be a specialist in the field or hold degrees of the same . but it doesnt treat you like you were an idiot . it does at times takes some thought of getting used to . their 'special topic issues ' may be avoided unless you want compendium issue of that topic.well received for the high-schooler either as the magazine or the website . at least the layperson can be science informed . the title of the magazine says it all
1	very interesting with nice pictures . gives a lot of information for travelling all over the world
1	old mac usr , new mac usr , matters not . there is something in this magazine for everyone . and , icreate has a pretty good online usr forum too .
0	a friend of mine got me a subscription to this magazine because i like cooks illustrated . this magazine is nothing but ads for snazzy expensive foods and restaurants . there are so few recipies in it i would n't call it a 'cooking ' magazine . what few recipies they do have do n't explain why they chose the ingredients used or give much detail at all . if you consider yourself a 'foodie ' who likes to go to fancy restaurants and likes to know what 's hip on the latest gourmet food and wine , then this magazine might be for you . if , however , you like to cook and know what you are doing and why you are doing it , try cooks illustrated instead .
1	i love this magazine ! it tells you about every new game that comes out brand new
0	i was going to buy this and then stumbled on it in the doctor 's office . i love instyle , lucky and other shopping mags , but the tone of this is mean and snooty . there are too many ads , and very little content . there 's a q section about sex after baby that 's just mean , threatening that if you do n't jump back in , `` one of you will start sleeping with the girl in marketing ... '' way to put an anti-feminist tone on sex after baby . yuck .
0	i subscribed to this magazine in august and just received the september issue now ! budget travel 's customer service is terrible , i 've complained several times but am still missing the august , october and november issues , have asked for a refund but have yet to have my account credited
0	i 'm not sure why this magazine is so highly rated . sure it 's an o.k . magazine , if you like immersing yourself in hype , marketing-speak and incredibly superficial language . admittedly the pictures are pretty and as an obsessed mountain biker i can say we like bike porn . i just can not read any of the articles . chock full of over-the-top adjectives and 'xtreme ' language . i do n't trust a magazine that calls every new incremental advancement in biking technology 'revolutionary ' or 'amazing ' or any number of disgustingly inappropriate modifiers . they ceaselessly use vapid 'technical ' jargon made up to sound high-minded and high-tech , but is nothing more than marketing spew . the tech advice column is full of suspicious letters that have the stench of stealth advertising . if there 's one thing that 's well thought-out about this magazine , it 's how best to bombard the reader with sales pitches , half-truths and hype . in short , this magazine is blatant industry propaganda . my first advice : do n't buy it . if you do buy it ( for the love of god ) do n't take anything between those covers seriously .
1	i love this magizine and i have read every issue . it has great fitness tips for you whole body . i would definately recomend this magizine to you
1	my husband and i both love to cook , and some of our new favorites come from this magazine . the reviews are informative , the recipes taste great ( and are not overly complicated ) , and the basic cooking suggestions are helpful . the magazine likes to pick a theme for the month ( or several ) which has a couple of benefits . 1 . you can cook a meal right from one issue and it all tastes great together and 2 . you have several options for one basic idea . for example one month there was a whole article on rice pilaff which starting with the basics ( so you could modify the basic recipe your own way ) and then gave several variations . best i have found out there so far
0	not nearly as appealing as the other magazines i have read : motortrend , car and driver , automobile mag , sport compact . i do n't like any of the long racing articles and anything on old cars . car and drivers off topic articles tend to be more interesting and occasionally very funny
1	golf digest is the big daddy of a well-populated family of golf publications . it 's self-styled tag line -- 'the # 1 golf publication ' -- is well-earned . where other weeklies report the golfing *news* , golf digest is a monthly celebration of golf as life , or at least of the golfing life . it 's golf-star-celebrity-packed articles tend to wear titles in the imperative ( 'do n't stretch your wedges ' ) , giving the sense that the golf world is populated by feverish self-improvers . even those of us who are less than bent on links glory , the photography of this publication looks extraordinary . this aspect reaches its zenith during the magazine 's frequent published admirations of the finer courses around the world . no doubt about it , golf digest is a lifestyle magazine as much as anything else . yet the semi- to really-serious golfer will find its pages rich with suggestions on improving his or her game . golf digest anchors the world of english-language golfing publications . even better , you can frequently pick it up for the price of a few frequent flyer miles
1	good housekeeping is a wholesome , clean , serious magazine . various topics that may be found in an issue - how to raise children , household tips , financial help , or marriage advice - suggest that the magazine is geared towards the middle-aged to the older woman . i 'm married and only in my 20s , but i still get so much out of reading the articles and advice anyway . i absolutely love this magazine ! i was looking for a magazine with good , long articles to read , and i found this great one . they even re-designed the look , and it 's excellent . everything is more organized , clearly separated into their respective sections , and each page is clearly marked with the section header so i 'll always know which section i 'm on . i particularly enjoy the articles about real-life triumphs and tragedies , talk to me by joy behar about relationship advice , and peggy post 's etiquette dilemmas
1	this magazine is one of the alltime best mags for men . it has everything you want , including hot babes , cars , gadgets , and sexy bikinis . it is also very cool in that it can turn you on to some cool stuff , like the new watches they showed by fossil and dkny , and some excellent martini recipes , and then they turned me on to a dvd called `` new sex now '' which has greatly enhanced my reputation with the ladies . i , for one , am hooked .
1	of the big 3 ( fortune , forbes , and businessweek ) , i like fortune the most . businessweek feels like it 's always copying someone or dying to jump on the bandwagon for the next big thing . forbes is a good magazine but sometimes is so original that it veers too far from its original purpose -- -to report and analyze the business world . fortune profiles the people it chooses and writes about current events without just summarizing the way businessweek does
1	this newsletter is a great resource for dog people . the articles are well researched , detailed , and best of all , applicable . i keep them in a binder , and often refer back to earlier issues if i have a health or training concern about my dogs ( and have been known to share them with friends . ) both the positive training and the holisitic health information is great . i definitely recommend this newsletter to anyone who loves their dogs .
1	great monthly information on the latest design trends and figures . sadly it only comes 2x 's a year
1	i have been a reader of motor trend for most of my life . i am 50 years of age and since high school art/design classes there has been nothing like motor trend for past , present , and future car , truck , and other motor vehicle design like this publication . ***** j. e. hoove
0	i used to sell and fix macs since the original mac 128 , i have owned 14 macs over 21 years so i have seen it all . mac addict is ok but only because our choices are so slim . mac user was always the best and i could n't bother renewing macworld after they got nasty with my late payment after i bought it for almost 20 years . i quit buying macaddict because of all the free disks . they were full of buggy freebies and ii turned me off . to keep up with macs , read the ny times in the circuits section and david pogue 's column , web site . also . if you can afford the wall st journal , read walt mossberg for all techy things . he gives a fair review and answers any questions he can , mac pc , camera . the wash post on line has a good tech writer for mac stuff.we reallt do n't need a magazine with the web . happy mac-ing and order tiger . i just got my new ipod photo 60 gig and a 1gig shuttle which i use every day in the gym . buy applecare and apple will cover the ( probably ) 2 batteries . i have an original ipod ( 10gig in 01 ) and the battery still works and i abused it on many plane trips . it still runs and is my bedroom pod hooked up to my bose cd/radio . yeah i love toys . roger taylo
0	i thought i detected some deterioration in the quality of discover magazine in recent months , so i went to the web to see if anyone else had the same notion . indeed they have . sad .
0	i got this magazine for a year and a half before i had to quit my subscription recently . i liked all the fashion tips and articles on how to dress for your body size and style , and that is why i subscribed to begin with . but i was not expecting the bombardment of amoral opinions forced on me . ( not to mention an overload of advertising- which you will get in most fashion magazines anyway , so that 's not a complaint ) . sure there was a few lines here and there that were nonbiased ( telling the facts of stds and such ) , but 90 % of the articles on sex , were opinion and not fact . girls today are having sex with anyone and getting hurt emotionally and physically because of magazines like seventeen who say that sex is good if you 're ready ( what 15 year old girl is ready to have sex and get an std or a baby ? ? please . ) , and that condoms are 100 % effective . they are not , but that 's what most teen girls believe because of stupid magazines like this . they need to take advice from their parents and doctors , not magazine articles . i was disgusted at the opinions presented as truth to basically promote teen girls doing whatever they want without consequences .
0	nice cover pictures and headlines , but way too many ads . there 's a reason its only twelve bucks , this is an ad-sponsored mag
0	as you can tell by the title , i 'm not enamored of this magazine . i 've been playing video games since the early 80s , and have read many , many gaming magazines . my reasons for this negative review of gamepro follow in no particular order : 1 . ) their numerical rating system stinks . 1-5 points is just not accurate enough . most mags/web sites have a 1-10 system with decimals . not gamepro . 2 . ) the written part of the reviews are way too short , and often are written borderline incoherantly . it 's as if they hired the proverbial 1,000 monkeys to type them out . 3 . ) often times they cram two or three reviews on one page . screen shots provided with reviews are often the size of a postage stamp . 4 . ) the number of ads in relation to content is distinctly high . once when i was bored , i counted all the ads in one issue . out of around 110 pages there were 60+ pages of ads . 5 . ) their article layouts are confusing , and occasionally they print on colored backgrounds that closely match the text color . forget about reading it if you 're colorblind . 6 . ) their gaming tips are either so obvious that a brain dead chimpanzee could figure them out , or plain do n't work . i suspect that the ones that do are ripped off from various web sites . 7 . ) gamepro costs the same as better gaming mags , such as egm and game informer . so , in closing ... if you want a good gaming magazine , just about any magazine other than gamepro would be an improvement . many great gaming magazines have come and gone , why a turd like gamepro continues is a mystery to me
0	do not buy this magazine ! for any price , it is too expensive . marie claire has harassed me repeatedly to pay for my subscription . it was paid for in advance thru amazon . i have sent them copies of my amazon receipt twice . they are reporting me to a credit agency for non-payment . avoid them , avoid them . they are scam artists and will falsely and with malice destroy your credit rating .
0	it takes too much time to receive the first book . i have n't received the first book yet
1	this magazine has been consistently good for many many years . ca n't live without i
1	this is perhaps my favorite photography magazine . the printing is fantastic as is the subject matter . i really like the fact there are no ads in it at all . so many photography mags are just an extended catalog for b or adorama that this is a breath of fresh air . the photography itself is second to none . always something interesting and fresh
1	it always seems like a holiday when my utne arrives . it has never failed to delight me in my long tenure as a subscriber and fan . nowadays , with so much of our `` news '' actually being political spin and hype , with that forced-fed feeling , it is so refreshing to be able to read interesting , tasty , thoroughly satisfying stuff that is not the run-of-the mill , banal , overly celebrity-focused junk . [ hey , i like celebrities just as much as the next guy , but i like to take a break once-in-a-while . ] utne respects your intelligence . it seems to arrive just on time , every time . the focus here is on improving one 's life and , perhaps , one 's corner of the world ( or just a corner of a room ) . sure , there is a progressive bent to the content ( it used to be dubbed `` the best of the alternative media '' ) : there 's ample pro-environment , pro-organic , pro-diversity , pro-spirituality content here . [ have they made `` progressive '' a dirty word , too ? ? ? ] i find it consistently conducive to recharging my batteries . go for it . you will be amply rewarded . like entering a fresh , new world every two months . you will likely read it from cover-to-cover
0	this overpriced magazine is for the weekend warriors who would like to start a new hobby . there is nothing wrong with this , we all started somewhere . however , one can only stand for so much of new tool ratings and how to build the same old challege-less pieces of furniture . please do n't waste your money . try fine woodworking , woodworking , or even popular woodworking . you will be greatful you did , and will be on the road to becoming an expert weekend warriors
1	i 'm one of those people who always looks up product reviews before buying anything , so it was on a leap of faith that i bought natural health magazine without reading anything about it . a friend suggested it , and since this particular friend has never led me wrong before , i caved in and bought the july/august 2005 copy immediately . let me start off by saying that i 'm an extremely picky person . i have extremely high standards for every purchase i make , and i absolutely will not cut a manufacturer any slack if i find a fault . now that i 've gotten that out of the way , i will mention that i was thoroughly impressed with natural health . long ago , i subscribed to new age magazine ( now known as body soul , which i do not care for ) . it was among my favorites solely due to its wide variety of content and true-to-focus natural lifestyle tips and advice . i can not stand redundancy , incorrect information and excessive advertising . i found that natural health was much more long the lines of the former new age magazine , filled with dozens of little gems that make it worth much more than the $ 3.95 i paid . to give you an idea of what the magazine includes , here is a small sampling of the articles i found in the july/august issue : small articles include : - `` to bee or not to bee '' , a breakdown on aromatherapy ingredients that include bee pollen , royal jelly , propolis , and honey , stating just how effective and natural these ingredients are . - `` how can i get relief from pms ? '' experts ( including a naturopath , gynecologist and dietitian ) answer this question with excellent responses . - `` medicine cabinet : attack of the weekend warrior '' natural remedies and aids for those like myself who love to be weekend warriors . - `` clothes to pose in '' great yoga gear ! - `` medical breakthroughs '' - `` healing supplements : 8 ways to beat anxiety '' - `` fitness fix - knee savers '' longer articles include : - `` healthy appetites : savvy strategies for eating well '' delicious , healthy recipes and tips . - `` good medicine : a clean , healthy mouth '' a well-researched article on `` mercury fillings , fluoride toothpaste and the best at-home remedies '' . - `` five paths to peace '' five simple meditation techniques . - `` eat to beat the heat : yin foods '' more great recipes ! - `` sacred spaces '' - making your home your personal retreat . this is only a sampling ; in fact , that 's less than half of the magazine alone . some articles are fairly short , but provide just the right amount of information to get the point across . my personal favorite was the last page , `` make one change '' , where this month 's change is to `` upgrade your z 's '' . it included simple tips that i was able to implement immediately . the amount of advertising seemed slightly less than usual ( probably about the same amount as you 'd find in a yoga journal , but not nearly as many as in oprah magazine ) , and they seemed to be in line with the natural health focus . judging by the past reviews on natural health , it seems the magazine had a bad run in the 2003-2004 timeframe . let 's remember that magazines change editors frequently . i found none of the past complaints to be true in this issue , but that may not be so in future issues years from now . as for me , i want a subscription asap
1	revolver 's competing magazines in the heavy metal magazine world are hit parader and circus . i have bought all three of these magazines several times , and revolver my final judgement is revolver is the only magazine that is good enough to subscribe to . the other two i still buy occasionally , but only for wallpaper ( i cut out the pictures of bands in the magazines and hang them in my room . ) this magazine is , in a way , like a combination of circus and blender magazines ; it combines the best aspects of both . revolver still has plenty of great pictures , but it is also much longer and much better written than circus . it is not quite as long or stuffed full of information as blender , but make sure you note that revolver only reports on one genre ( heavy metal ! ) whereas blender could ( theoretically ) report on every genre ( rap , pop , rock , etc . ) chances are , if a hard rock band ( especially a big name hard rock band ) is about to or has already released a c.d. , revolver will do a story about it . the stories/reports are very entertaining but they also are informative and sometimes a lesson is learned from them . if it 's a cover story , an interview with the band is also included ; if it 's not a cover story , the writer integrates quotes and answers from the band into the article , anyways ( even though it 's not a formal interview ) . revolver writers frequently go on tour with a band ( i.e . lamb of god ) . in that case , they take the reader backstage , on the tour bus , and in a concert ( with a rundown of the show ) . when i first started reading this magazine , there was a sexual theme to it . there would be a picture of a `` hot babe '' in a t-shirt , and one side of the poster would be a woman-usually half-naked-in a sexual pose . in the past year or so , revolver phased that out ( probably to appeal to a broader audience ) . i sometimes miss the pictures of the `` hot babes , '' but this way there 's more room for real heavy metal pictures . yet , even though sex is n't a theme anymore , revolver is probably a bit too sophisticated for anyone younger than a teenager . plus , there are usually profanities ( mainly the `` f word . '' ) so , i would say this magazine is for ages 13 and up . monthly articles : -cover story -3 or 4 other biggish stories - `` fresh blood '' column ( where a small biography is given on a band you probably have n't heard of ) - ask vinnie ( an column where readers write questions , and pantera/damageplan drummer vinnie paul gives advice ) - hard rock news and notes - black and death metal news and notes - `` in the studio '' ( an update on bands currently recording new music ) -free poster ( in the middle of the magazine , there 's a fold-out poster of one or two bands . ) the poster is n't very wide , but it is about two pages long -free music downloads - '' ink spot '' ( a story about a musician 's favorite tattoo ) - '' favorite sh*t '' ( an interview with a musician , with questions such as `` what 's your favorite color ? '' ) -joke from a band ( revolver has just recently started doing this ) - reviews ( reviews of c.d . 's , music dvd 's , and video games ) pros : -- plenty of good pictures and a free poster -- professionally written with well known writers ( yet it is not too intelligent for teenagers ) -- edited well ( i have n't found any mistakes or typos ) -the `` fresh blood '' column usually introduces me to a band i have n't heard of , but i should probably check out -- revolver is accredited and well known enough to be allowed to go on tours with bands and be first for interviews -- news columns ( on both mainstream and underground metal bands ) -the stories are always done with quotes from the band that the report is on -- free music ! ( revolver has started doing a page that gives the reader a password , which he/she can then access free music downloads online . ) -- no stupid questions in interviews ( they ask up to date questions , and sometimes-i.e . in the interview with puddle of mudd-the writers are n't afraid to ask daring , cutting questions ) -- the `` in the studio '' segment is always informative -- helpful , reliable reviews ( they do n't automatically praise every heavy metal c.d . ) cons : -- if you 're up to date on your music news web sites , the news columns should n't really be anything new to you . -- not all c.d . 's are reviewed ( they give a rundown on the c.d . in the article about the band , but c.d . 's from bands that are on the cover of the magazine are n't usually reviewed . ) -concerts are n't reviewed -my biggest gripe is that it 's only issued once a month . the bottom line is , if you 're a metalhead , this is the best magazine you can get ! it is more than well worth the ten dollars you will spend for a years worth of entertainment
1	organic gardening ( og ) is an excellent gardening reference for gardeners of all skill levels . in addition to hints and tips for growing flowers and vegetables naturally , each og issue is packed with all types of interesting , insightful , and often humorous articles covering a wide range of topics from composting to building a bat house . from farmers to container gardeners , og has something for everyone
1	this magazine is so delightful ! fantastic tutorials-great photos and wonderful info . i enjoy it very much and would n't hesitate to subscribe again . i heartily recommend it
1	if you need to keep abreast of financials and business on a monthly basis , forbes and fortune are the two conventional choices . i started reading fortune - and subscribing - four years ago when i realized that the business people with whom i associated regularly simply assumed that one knew any news or analysis that broke in its pages . it fits as a must-read monthly overview in my reading habits . fortune represents a generally bullish and strongly pro-business perspective with just a touch of cynicism about corporate leadership and its trends . you wo n't find anything radical here , but you need to have read it if this kind of news , analysis , and opinion fits your job description or personal interests . there is a smattering of 'toys for the businessperson ' in each edition . for me , the highlight is stanley bing 's delicious , irreverent , and every so slightly jaded backpage column . i routinely scan it or mail it to a relative who laughs out loud at bing 's corporate lunacy as i do . fortune is behind the eponymous fortune 500 and other derivative lists . for me , one of the most valuable is the magazine 's annual '500 largest corporations by revenue ' , though this is dictated by the scope of my own interests . other readers will tear out or access other fortune lists online with equal interest . if you 're in business or work with people who are , you 'd better be reading fortune or forbes or both
0	i was looking forward to a magazine that took a good look at different subjects than those covered in the mainstream media . what i received was a manual on how to think the `` right '' way . i 've never delved deeply into politically labeling myself , but i vaguely considered myself a liberal . man , was i wrong . clearly , liberal means much the same as the demonized `` conservative '' . this magazine has a single viewpoint , that of an ultraliberal ex-hippie who has found themselves wealthy in the 21st century . it is full of articles about `` finding meaning '' and `` reassessing life '' that seem to have been written by folks who drive chevy suburbans and pay too much for a cup of coffee . the magazine gives off a strong smell of covert superiority , and it made me nauseous
1	i have been subscribing to this mag for a couple years , and think it 's one of the best gaming mags available . i have several different consoles , and appreciate that they review games for all platforms . i like the rating system ( 1-10 ) instead of the too-hard-to-pin-down 1-5 , and find the reviews well written and objective . while i have been gaming for years , i am not necessarily versed in computer lingo , but i never feel like an idiot after reading this mag ; the writing is erudite but very easy to understand . i read several different gaming magazines each month , and feel this magazine strikes exactly the right balance between the more serious and more frivolous gaming magazines in the industry . one suggestion : if you have a gamestop or affiliated store in your neighborhood , get your subscription through them . for about $ 15 you receive a 12-year subscription , and a card that gives you 10 % off used games at these stores , as well as an extra 10 % trade-in value on your used games ( sometimes there will be a coupon in that month 's mag to upgrade to 20 % for both ! ) .
1	this is simply the best woman 's magazine i 've ever read ! and i can say that i 've read a lot of them - both in the us and in germany . i 've read it for over 12 years and i can say that i never got bored with it . i 'm still excited about any new issue . the articles always matter and they catch just the right balance between being serious and entertaining . it 's for the modern young woman . to name a few subjects : career , love , sex , family , style , wellness , travel reports and interviews - every article going a bit deeper than the usual woman 's magazine . there 's really something to read for days . and on a side not : there 's more articles than ads !
0	i subscribed to this magazine in january for my husband . it took 5 months to get the first magazine , then i never recieved another one
1	if you have your own small business or start-up , or are even slightly thinking about starting one , this magazine is well worth the small cost . i usually bring mine on the plane along with a couple others
0	i ordered this mag back in june , now it 's december and i 've yet to receive it . this equals a big fat zero in my book .
0	this magazine is almost as bad as consumer reports . their comparison tests never adhere to their thesis about what the tests is measureing , for example a comparison test is said to be about quick acceleration and on point handling and then the car with the lack lust performance in handling and acceleration would be # 1 in ranking . often , the car reviews are always mentioning information about a car that is n't relevant , or does n't make sense , or the review is n't consistent with the posted viehicle stats . the magazine also seems to be biased . some vehicles are criticized with more irrelevant information than others to say its awful . after further reading of many issues , you would think they are playing favortism towards certain brands or recieving kick backs from manufacturers , for example , you will always see the domestic brand being referred to as basically `` trash '' and a japanese brand or a bmw is always the way to go , when once again the posted stats and sometimes photos say different.this is more noticeable when you can predict the out come of their reviews . ultimately , its a bad guide towards getting any information on automobiles period . its the pat robertson of auto magazines . if it were possible , i woudl n't even give this magazine 1 star .
0	sure i like a mystery- who does n't ? but when you a read a magazine like hitchcock you end up losing faith in the short mystery story . the tales are hard-edged and lacking in style and substance . we seem to have a wealth of mystery writing talent but time and again hitchcock magazine is a disappointment . the value for money is horrible , the magazine is printed on newsprint paper and the ink just needs to be touched to smudge- alfred hitchcock would not be proud
0	awful ! ! ! this is just page after page after page of ads for grotesque jewelry - mostly gaudy watches and necklace sets - and clothing . there were two `` articles '' at the very end of the magazine , and they were awful . one , on christmas in the english countryside , should have been beautiful . instead , it contained just a few pics and very little text . what a disappointment . do n't waste your money . first pick up a copy in the supermarket before you waste money on a subscription . once you see how really ridiculous this magazine full of nothing but ads really is , you wo n't waste your money on a subscription .
0	for ads only pretty much . there is not much to read or learn for the common reader . it seems like it 's mailing for the fashion elite not for everyone .
0	this magazine is chock full of supplement advertisements . advertisements in fashion magazines are annoying , but supplements can be unhealthy and dangerous . these ads may have something to do with the target audience of the magazine ... it seems to be directed to women who are hard core about weightlifting and fitness , to the level of competition . a recent article in the magazine was talking about what percentage of body fat was too low for women . some of the women had body fat below 10 % - i 'm trying to get mine below 30 % . it 's just a different fitness/weightloss league completely . i like magazines like fitness and shape better because it sets more reasonable goals and provides more reasonable advice . i can substitute toast with jam for bagels with cream cheese . i ca n't drink protein shakes for breakfast and lunch , eat 10 servings of protein a day , and pop potentially dangerous pills . i am very disappointed with this magazine..
0	i should preface this reveiw with the fact that i am an accomplished home cook . i have been cooking for 25 years and own more than 500 cookbooks . i do not buy commercially prepared products like breads , crackers , mayonnaise or salad dressings . i make these items myself . i suspect that i am not the target audience for this publication . the may/june 2006 issue is 32 pages in length in total . given that there are only 6 issues a year , i was expecting a little more than a mere 32 pages . the may/june 2006 issue contains the following information : simplifying moroccan chicken bringing home fish and chips grilled tomato salsa grilled london broil main-dish vegetable stir-fries how to cook pasta foolproof veal scaloppini a new twist on chicken salads garlic and olive oil mashed potatoes utimate turtle brownies best strawberry cream cake the scoop on vanilla ice cream a review of tongs if you are an experienced cook their is n't much about cooking in this issue that will be new to you . this issue contained not a single piece of new information for me about cooking . however , i enjoyed the equipment reveiws and did find them informative and useful . this magazine would be helpful if someone is an inexperienced cook . bottom line , i will not be renewing my subscription unless future issues have a little `` more meat '' in their content . i think that this magazine is overpriced for what you receive . i would suggest saving the price of the subscription and buy their `` best of '' cookbook instead . it costs about the same amount , contains many more recipes , has many of their equipment reviews and is bound in a hard cover so that it will hold up longer . additionally , check out an issue of `` fine cooking '' which is another test kitchen type of publication , just with more depth .
1	this magazine is amazing ! ! it keeps getting better and better , unlike all the other sell-out magazines such as muscle fitness . it 's a shame it does n't have more readers ! if you like the mag then pass it around , people work hard to put it together ! a great buy !
1	i saw this magazine while browsing a local bookstore and it was a magazine that stood out for some reason ... i picked it up and flipped through a few pages and came across an article on maggie gyllanhall . i had recently watched `` secretary , '' and i liked her , so i bought it . i 'm not much for fashion magazines but this is much different from others like vogue . after buying my first flaunt magazine , i wanted to buy more , but needless to say , the bookstore has not gotten any in for a long time ... : ( this magazine will be great for readers who are bored with the same crap churned out in every other magazine out there..
1	i have been subscribing to alfred hitchcock 's mystery magazine for many years . i find it an excellent periodical . the genres range from humor , cosies , hard-boiled detectives , to locked room puzzles , with an added dessert of a `` mystery classic '' at the end of every issue , some dating from the 19th century . i especially enjoy the absence of gore . the stories are just the right length to satisfy your `` mystery craving '' before bedtime . another kudo : the ahmm is notably hospitable to aspiring short story mystery authors
0	we received first issue of guitar world and there was no bonus cd-rom . called the magazine and was told that since we purchased the subscription from amazon at $ 19.95 that there would be no monthly cd-rom . they charged us another $ 10 to have the monthly cd-rom added to the subscription for the rest of the issues . but that cd-rom is mentioned in amazon 's editorial review of the magazine . you get the impression that you are getting a deal on this magazine , but you are not because you do n't get the bonus cd-rom . it turns out to be the same rate as if you buy directly from the magazine
0	love to review history today , but have n't seen a copy yet . any ideas
0	i liked time magazine a lot until they named george bush person of the year ? oh my god , where were all the educated editors/writers when they let this moron write this article
0	this was a gift for my daughter . instead of receiving the new yorker , she is receiving people . you need to fix this
