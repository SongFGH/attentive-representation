1	this is a great product . very quick to heat and i enjoy the dettachable base feature . the cons include a limited amount to pour water into the unit ( the lid does n't pop up very far ) and some of the finish does n't do great with steam . overall a good buy
1	i like this pan because of the tapered shape . it cooks sauces without boiling over because it is tall , and it sits perfectly on the small burner with no overlap for even heating . the handles stay cool , and the clean up is easy . beautiful exterior also . like all all clad products , this pan is worth the money . long lasting and well designed . the only thing i wish all clad would add is hash marks on the interior so i could see when i have reduced a sauce to half .
0	i have four 16-piece sets that i received for my wedding . they are beautiful plates , but they have a tendency to split in half with normal use - like heating food up in the microwave , going through the dishwasher or serving hot food . within 3 months , several plates cracked down the middle , making them unusable . a large serving bowl also split in half when hot food was added . i did a search on www.epinions.com and found i was n't the only person having these problems . everyone is having these problems . plus , it is impossible to find individual replacement pieces . you have to buy another set . what a racket . the clincher is that they are located in indonesia , so customer service and responsiveness is nonexistent . i 've gotten nothing but the international run-around
0	yes , it is pretty . no , it is not a good teapot . i have made tea for over 40 years , in all sorts of pots , and this is right up there with the worst . it drips a lot ! perhaps those who think it does not drip were just looking at the spout . and no , it does not drip from the spout . rather , lots of tea runs down the underside of the spout and ends in a big puddle under the pot . this happens with both fast and slow pouring , with full and near empty pots . this teapot will most likely have to become a pretty red flowerpot . just too much mopping up
0	i have to agree with the review about overflowing and basket popping ... .while this coffee maker does make excellent coffee , if you put a grain too much of ground coffee in it , it will overflow ... .very frustrating as we like strong coffee . because ours has overflowed so many times , the metal plate on the bottom has corroded and now it wo n't hold water ... .i 'll never buy this frogware again
1	i 'm glad we went back to braun for a coffee maker . tried a few others but they were n't as good . braun makes a hot , good cup of java , faster than most . i do wish they would go back to the 12 cup pot
0	the written description of this heater led me to believe that it would perform like the 2 5-yr-old vornado models that are the best electric heaters i 've ever had . the vh2 has major flaws . it 's single fan speed is way too fast , causing heated air to be cool/cold within 10 ft of the heater . the fan can not be slowed down . the thermostat causes the fan to stop and start in ridiculously short intervals ; thereby wasting energy i believe . finally , the thermostat is set so that when at the highest ( hottest ) setting it does n't allow the heater to bring even the immediate area around it to more than 70 degrees f. i 've had the heater 1 mo and will attempt to return it for a full refund in another wk or 2 as soon as i have an alternative brand in my home
0	i was so excited to get this set in the mail for my son , but when i took it out of the package it felt like sandpaper . i have washed it several times but it is still very rough . also the first time i washed it one seam ripped all the way down the side and frayed . it was very cheaply made , but my son does love it , purely because its thomas i 'm sure . i would n't buy this again
0	saw these canisters and fell in love with them . could n't wait to get them and when i did they were broken into a million pieces . they replaced them very timely but one lid is almost too small and the seal does n't fit properly . another lid fits so tight it takes two hands to get the lid off . i was disppointed in the quality . i would n't buy these again even if i had to buy something more expensive
1	this was my third foil cutter in one month . the other two were flimsy but cost about the same . they each broke in about two weeks . i have had this one for five months and it is n't broken yet
1	admittedly , i am a bit of a knife-buying nut . i love kitchen knives and own chef 's knives and santuko knives from wusthof , henckels , kyocera and furi . this calphalon katana 6-inch chef 's knife is incredibly sharp and it feels really good in the hand balance-wise . i like the way the handle is shaped , it is very comfortable and the bolster is ingenious . i love the way it looks too ! for the price , i 'd say you ca n't go wrong . i really like it a lot ! i have only had it for a few weeks though , but it seems to be of very good quality and hopefully we 'll see how well it resharpens when the need arises .
1	i thought i would by this product just to try with my senseo machine and some coffee i brought from europe . it works ! i also use it with my tea pods and got a great cup of tea . i will buy more
1	i used this pan just this morning and i really like it . it has a great non-stick surface and is easy to clean . the price is great also . the only thing that might be a problem for some people is the handle . it slants downward instead of upward . so , if you have a flat surface stovetop , your pan wo n't sit flat on the surface . i have a gas stove and it is not a problem for me . i did n't notice this from the picture and the descriptions do n't mention this but i think it is important to know . who knows , maybe i got a defective pan and do n't know it . other than that , it is a great pan for the money . i like it more than other non-stick pans i have had .
0	i almost threw this coffee maker across my living on more than one occasion due to it 's extremely poor design . mr. coffee really struck out on this one considering they are a company that only makes coffemakers . first of all , the water filter device failed after a few uses and would no longer allow water to flow freely through it . this could have been due to the hardness of the tap water in my area but regardless , it 's a filter , it 's supposed to be able to be subjected to not so perfect water . so before i figured out the filter wasnt allowing water to flow i would let it brew and the water would never make it out of the resovoir and would basically just steam up and evaporate . after the entire brewing cycle i would pull the carafe out and there would be no coffee in the carafe . after realizing it was the filter that was causing problems i just simply removed it and didnt use it . the coffee maker worked for a few days but only if you place the paper coffee filter in perfectly . otherwise , the dripping water would cause the filter to collapse and then the grains would run out of the filter , clogging the drain and then voila , you get an overflowed grain basket with dirty , grainy water all over your counters . i do not recommend this coffee maker for any reason . get the hamilton beach stay or go 45234
0	first of all add was deceiving : product description new ! non-slip cascading hangers hang up to twelve shirts or blouses , eight skirts , and eight slacks in the same amount of space it takes to fit a single hanger ! store more clothes than ever imagined in your closet and free up essential drawer space . use separately or hook together . non-slip coating keeps clothes on the hanger and off the floor . durable , chrome-plated . 12 shirt hangers 8 skirt hangers 8 pant hangers the last sentence makes you think that is what you are ordering . also , very cheaply made . 2 were broken in the box , one broke while hanging something up . i ended up super gluing them together . i did not want the hastle of sending them back . beware of this product ! ! !
1	i was surprised by the quick delivery . i opened the box to check the bowls . everything was intact and i was happy to give them to my cousin as a wedding present
1	i bought this knife for my daughter for her birthday . i 'm sure she 's going to enjoy using it . i had the occasion to use it at her house after she unwrapped it and found it to be amazing . it was so well balanced and weighted that when slicing a potato very little pressure had to be applied . now i just have to get one for myself . well , my birthday is coming up in february
1	i bought this for my husband three years ago , and he absolutely loves it . in fact , many people who come to our house ask about it , as the coffee is superb . we are very picky about our coffee , tending to buy expensive brands and grind the beans ourselves , and this coffeemaker wins hands down over the many we have had through the years . i would never consider another brand and would hesitate to buy another model . the coffee is usually hot throughout the day ( depending on how much is in it , of course ) , as my husband always heats it with boiling water before he brews the coffee . we have never had the first problem with boilovers , leaking , implosions ( huh ? ) , etc . in fact , i 'm getting one for my daughter and her husband for christmas , as they always admire ours
0	i received this popper as a gift , and while it looks nice , it only pops of 30 percent of the kernels the rest just sit in the bottom of the machine . i have tried numerous times letting the device warm up for several minutes and also tried different types of popcorn . nothing worked . if i had the receipt it would already have been returned . since i do n't , it is going in the garbage . also for some reasons hot unpopped kernels will fly out of the machine . stay away from this machine
0	they sent me a blue hudson jacquard diamond love seat slipcover 3 times . i gave up after the 3rd time . what really sux is that they did send the olive sofa cover ! ! ! so now they do n't match ! ! !
0	i 've been through four of these expensive units . they work great on my great pyrenees dog . at least they work for awhile . then i end up trying to figure out if the batteries are dead , then if the new batteries i put in were dead to begin with , and then i send it back for repair . once i got back a unit that worked again - for awhile . then i got back a unit that never worked again.i stopped sending in my broken units after that . so - in desperation , and impending poverty , i switched to a shock collar ; it was either that or what my breeder calls a `` blue juice special '' . it also worked - and yes , i tried it on myself and decided that it was n't cruel at all . but the punchline is this : the shock collars broke at about the same rate as the citronella collar . at least they were cheaper , so i did n't lose as much money
0	this is not a 2 quart sauce pan , it is 2.5 quarts , exactly the same as the one that comes with the se
1	this pan along with several others i have acquired from the calphalon tri-ply line is fantastic . great weight and balance , superb craftsmanship , the glass lids fit snugly and most important of all , the pricing is terrific . i have all-clad and yes , it is wonderful but quite frankly i find myself asking why spend more when you can get equal quality for quite a bit less . and it is still made in u.s.a .
1	i recomend this item highly . can be washed without fear of water inside and can be inside the oven while cooking . works like a charm . mik
0	just recently purchased the thermometer and the clip does not hold the theremometer in place . paid $ 6.50 for item and $ 6.34 for shipping and was very displeased/upset with quality of the item . i thought the clip would hold the thermometer in the upright position so you could move the frothing cup in circular motion . thermometer falls over due to clip not tight enough on thermometer shaft .
1	great all around microwave for singles . the only thing it does not do well is microwave popcorn
1	excellent . heavy duty and well made . the satin nickel looks expensive . it stands about 13 `` high with a good , strong support base . it should last a lifetime . jdg 3/6/0
0	was happy with this toaster until i had it for about 4 months . at that time the lever started acting up by not staying down . sometimes it worked other times we had to prop something heavy on it to keep it down . not what i expect from a $ 70 toaster . well , i have finally given up ( 2 months later ) and am sending it back to hamilton beach since too much time has passed to send it to amazon . they are sending me a new one , which i am not sure i am happy about . might just exchange it somewhere for a toaster-oven ... ... ...
0	a drawback of calphalon 's anodized alumninum is that it can not be cleaned in the dishwasher . but stainless steel is dishwasher safe , and amazon 's product description claims that calphalon 's stainless steel line is dishwasher safe . but if you check out www.calphalon.com and look at the description of their stainless line , it explicitly prohibits using dishwasher detergent . so it is `` dishwasher safe '' but you ca n't use dishwasher detergent .
0	this product is markedly inferior to its main competitor , the pur 2-stage dispenser . specifically , i found two main flaws : 1 . the spigot draws water from at least an inch and a half up from the base of the dispenser . as a result , quite a lot of water is left inaccessible for drinking , even after tipping over the dispenser . 2 . even more infuriatingly , the spigot 's connection to the main housing is so poorly designed that it eventually starts to leak water all over the place . the first dispenser i purchased started to leak after 1 week . i dutifully exchanged it for another one , which proceeded to leak after about 2 weeks . it appears that the `` o-ring '' that connects the spigot to the main housing shrinks when it gets cold . . . a rather fatal flaw for an item intended for use in a refrigerator . despite being a lifelong brita user , i exchanged this product for a pur 2-stage dispenser . i am now converted and will never go back . the dispenser is rock solid , and the water even tastes better
1	i wanted to dress up my kitchen a little , and this does the trick ( makes me not dread washing the dishes . an added plus ! ) . it 's a nice cherry red , and i 'm a bit of a `` red junkie . '' i gave this five stars because it 's perfect for my needs . if you have a large family and tons of dishes it 's going to be on the small side though . the red colander 's a great extra , as is the little sponge holder ( it has suction cups to keep it in place , but mine does n't seem to stay stuck . that 's a minor detail , though , and it could have more to do with my kitchen 's tiling than the suction cups ) . one thing to note -- if your sink 's drains are n't centered you might be annoyed with the hole in the middle of the rubber sink mat . overall , this is a durable and nice to look at sinkware set . what more could we want ?
1	i bought this espresso coffee maker to use with warm milk . it is great if you like to make lattes . or just plain expressos . it brews fast , less than two minutes . it makes a great cuban coffee but make sure you use the coffee like pilon or bustelo that comes in pressed packets not the cans . i do not use italian roast because i do not think it would give me the same flavor for my lattes .
1	in 1970 i was given a set of presto waterless cookware along with a pancake griddle . at that time they did n't have non-stick griddles . through the years the handles broke , but the grill fit over my stainless steel sink , so no problem . in 1999 i figured it was time to replace it with a new one . i really loved it because it never stuck and once again i could rely on it . in 2002 i started a pancake breakfast to raise money for our club . it started with my presto grill and soon i added a second one . over the next 18 months we raised $ 3,500 with those two grills , serving pancakes , french toast , bacon , etc . my 3rd grill is still going strong and puts out our sunday breakfasts at home . it is so refreshing to be able to depend upon the quality of an appliance these days . thank you presto
1	i had bought my first fiestaware cereal bown sight unseen from amazon.com , and i absolutely love the rich , cinnamon color of cinnabar ! the cereal bowl comes in handy and we use it for hot and cold cereal , soup , ice cream , and leftovers ( smaller portions ) . it 's microwaveable , too ! if you 've never used fiestaware before , this would be a great introduction to the line , especially if you have use for smaller soup/cereal bowls .
0	the pin is not properly secured to the body of the pitter . after a few uses it will pop off . i 've gone through three of these pitters from my local linens 'n things . how could the designers be so inept
1	the english take their toast seriously , and while i do n't share their affinity for beans on toast for breakfast , i lusted after this gorgeous piece of appliance art at williams-sonoma for years . about seven years ago , when the dollar was still strong versus the british pound , i bought the 2+2 combi model by mail from a restaurant supplier in the uk for about $ 100 less than the then-going us price . while it 's a bit dicey fitting thick-cut bagels into the slots ( not a big bread item in the uk ) , i solve the problem by using the sandwich baskets to contain them . the toasting is even , and i actually the enjoy the old-fashioned timer without pop-up , which keeps the toast warm while the rest of breakfast is being assembled . unlike others , i do not unplug it after each use . never had a problem . the crumb tray is terrific , and actually does catch every bit of crumb without a mess . i 've had the $ 100 krups and cuisinart models , which burned out within two years . this one is made for restaurant use , and i expect it to last a lifetime . worth every penny , if you appreciate high-end kitchen appliances and tools
1	this knife is great for hard cheeses , i can cut them without the slices crumbling to pieces . it feels very comfortable and sturdy in my hand like my other global knife . the blade has a serrated edge so you will not be able to sharpen it easily , but if you only use it for cheese , it should stay sharp for a long time . this is another beautiful global knife
1	i could not resist trying this method of making espresso . you know you can spend alot trying to get a decent product and i have not been disappointed with the practically inexpensive bialetti . the first attempt was successful and that told me this was for me ... .the bonus milk frother made more froth that an old steamer frother i used to have . there are a few tricks with the frother ( 1 % milk by itself not so good but add some half and half to the milk and voile ' ) . the milk mixture needs to be heated enough to coat the back of a spoon , pump it quickly and serve . regarding the espresso maker itself ... .just do n't add any more water than to that line..and oh do n't open the lid to look at it until it is done or you will get sputter onto your stove top . to know when the espresso is done just listen you will know when it is done ... .very quick and yummm
0	i read tons and tons of reviews of this product and decided to take a chance on it . well that chance did not pay off . even in combination with the spray model my cat continued to spray everywhere . if anyone else has ideas for something that does work i would really appreciate it .
0	we bought a well-reviewed carpet vacuum from amazon last year , and absolutely love it . after that positive experience , we were looking for something for our kitchen , bathroom and hallway floors and came upon this cleaner . starting with the dry vac part , that seems to get smallish pieces of dirt fine , but anything cheerio sized or larger it pushes around on the floor unless you lean the vacuum back . which would be fine , but if you lean it back too far , there is a suction filter thing ( made for the wet vac part ) that sticks and you have to turn off the vacuum and wait about 10 seconds for the suction to release that piece before you can continue . anyway , the small dirt and dust are really picked up quite well , but if any of you have small children ( we have 3 boys under 6 ) , do n't have any expectations of this getting up mealtime messes . now , onto the wet vac part , which was the main reason we got this . very disappointing . we used the included cleaner , warm tap water , etc as the directions indicated , and both my wife and i swear the floor is no cleaner than when we started . it does n't look cleaner , shine more or even have a nice smell that we could even close our eyes and pretend it was clean . spills or stains that normally take 1-3 passes with a mop are taking 8-12 passes with this machine . we bought this to save time and/or get cleaner floors , and i can honestly say that this machine did not do either . as briefly noted above , if you have children , do not expect clean floors out of this , and i ca n't recommend this at all . this product may be suitable for people who have no children , no pets and only small dust particles and light traffic ; i just know this is n't our house
0	these are not riedel crystal ! after i returned them , i told amazon that that need to update the description . if you read the fine print , it does say `` manufactured to exact specifications of riedel , austria '' . they are made by some other company , not in austria , and the quality is very , very low . you get what you pay for
0	we had previously bought this same coffee maker new and liked it so much that we wore it out . when i saw the refurbished for $ 20.00 i thought it was a great deal . it would have been if it had come with all the parts and did n't leak ! ! it did n't come with seals or with the water purifier . i tried everything including new seals ( that i bought separately ) . eventually we just went out and purchased a new one , because we still like the model .
0	i always buy products from amazon and i never have any complains about any of them . but about this product , i am so disappoint because the lids does'nt fit with the 32 oz . containers . i hope that they fix this problem because is a good way to keep your kitchen organized
1	getting those decanters to dry without spots can be problematic . this is a big help . the wide base allows better balance than you would think , and is really very secure . i would prefer a larger balance point , but this does the job
0	because just around the 60 day mark , the chime turned into a terrible noise like something dying . i just turned that feature off and continued enjoying the dispenser , but a month later ( 3 months after original purchase ) , the thing is spewing soap non-stop . wasted lots of soap this way . changing the batteries did n't help . soap just flows out until there 's none left . to maintain some customer satisfaction , sharper image should consider backing their products with a better return policy or providing some better quality control
0	riedel 's water glass and gourmet glass are both made in france of glass ( not crystal ) . the stem 's too short for wine in my opinion , but you could always use them for water . the water glasses are more suitable , though , as they have a wider mouth
1	this is a great pan . aside from the fact that it is easily the best non-stick on the market ( and i have used anolon , calphalon and scanpan ) , what continues to impress me most about this pan is its even heat distribution . there are no hot spots , not even the center . when sauteing the food colours evenly ( even when the pan is a little overcrowded ) ; when stewing , you often see tight little bubbles across the surfact of your food , demonstrating how even the heat distribution is . this pan also makes a fine risotto . oh , and did i mention its non-stick is simply the best . clean up is a breeze . nothing sticks . even baked on pasta sauce wipes out with a little water . the surface on swiss diamond is so good that if you make pancakes it is often hard to get the turner under the pancake without sending the pancake to the other side of the pan ! swiss diamond is the king of non-stick , as not only is their surface no . 1 , but the quality of their pans is second to none . i own two swiss diamond pieces , i plan to buy more , and i could n't recommend these pans more highly . this is the pan i reach for the most
1	it 's a towel . not too much to say , for more information , read the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy by douglas adams . very good quality , resiliant , color has n't faded , despite being used to dry me off after falling into a creek , being used as padding for my elbow at the firing range , and wiping up spilled cleaning chemicals . tough little bugger
1	this is essentially the all-clad stainless steel 3 quart saucier fitted with 2 short handles . the `` dutch oven '' sold by all-clad is a similar configuration of the 5 1/2 quart saucier . this is a versatile stovetop pan -- wide enough for frying , deep enough for liquids , good-looking enough to carry to the table . it can also slide into the oven when needed . it may not be big enough to do a traditional 19th century cassoulet , with large hunks of meat and a gallon or so of beans , as one poster complained , but it functions quite well as an `` everyday pan '' for up to 4 persons . the dimensions of 9 1/2 inches by 3 inches ( plus handles ) fit the 3 quart capacity into a compact shape , with a rounded bottom for easy stirring . if you are looking for a versatile `` do-it-all '' pan , this is a good choice
1	this is a lovely little crockpot whose small size makes it uniquely useful for a number of purposes . i 've owned larger crockpots for a couple decades ( currently a 6 quart rival smartcooker is my mainstay for preparing family-size meals ) , but the larger pots take up a significant amount of counter space are n't at all useful for heating or re-heating small quantities . this little crockpot , however , is perfect for heating or re-heating 2-4 servings of soup or stew . i originally bought it , however , because it is *absolutely perfect* for making hot cereal on cold mornings , especially those hot cereals that require more than a few minutes of cooking in the microwave or on the stovetop , such as steel-cut oatmeal ( try the nutty goodness of traditional steel-cut oatmeal once ( also available here at amazon ) you 're unlikely ever to return to instant or `` quick cook '' oatmeal again ) . there is nothing nicer on a cold winter morning than walking into the kitchen knowing that a healthy , delicious hot breakfast is awaiting you . from mid-october to late-march , virtually every night i prepare my entire family 's hot breakfast cereal for the next morning in this little crockpot , with no more effort than is required to make single serving of instant oatmeal or cream of wheat in the microwave . other uses we 've discovered : it 's perfect for making serving hot mulled cider ; keeping hot dips , gravies warm sauces syrups heated on the buffet ; as a substitute fondue pot ; for heating soup at times when hovering over a stovetop or near a microwave would be incovenient ( how nice to come inside from raking leaves or shoveling snow to a hot bowl of soup ! ) . for single people or couples who prefer not to cook in large quantities or apartment dwellers with limited storage space , this crockpot would be a very acceptable slow cooker , especially if used in conjunction with rival 's inexpensive sp100-pdq smart-part module ( also sold on amazon as of the date of this review ) , which provides the same timed-cooking controls that are integrated with many of rival 's larger , more expensive crockpots . the energy used is minimal , too -- only 80 watts -- the stoneware bowl fits easily in the dishwasher , as does the lid , for very convenient clean-up
0	i was tired of replacing wires on my old cheese slicer every couple of years . the blade `` bends '' through a block of cheese . it doesnt provide a straight cut .
0	we got this as a gift used it ... ..its loud and spits out water . we 're not happy with it
0	we bought these for our two girls ( 2 and 5 ) so that they could have dishes matching out stoneware and they were great , for a while . now we are down to 1 out of the original 4 we ordered due to the plates cracking over time ( 5 months since we ordered ) . they have n't been abused and have been washed in the dishwasher on no heat . same issue with the bowls . ymmv , but when 3 out of 4 are dead , i think there is a problem
0	i used this item twice-the second time i had one sweatshirt and one sweater on the rack it broke into 5 pieces ! waste of money
0	i have two earlier aerobeds and they are very comfortable and conforms to support our bodies . this new premier durasuede is like lying on a sheet of tin . the material is so stiff it does not conform to our body . i find it unusable
1	my only complant is that the cord is shorter then i am used to . but i guess it needs to be for the automatic rewind . this feature is a must however since my husband always griped at me for not coiling up the cord properly . it sucks great , is easy to clean , and light weight . the price is fantastic
0	i thought i was getting a good deal and a good product at a cheap price , but instead i got what a paid for and nothing more . cheap product at a cheap price . only used a few times , literally 2-3 times , then one time when my girlfriend put the glass down on the table it broke and wine went everywhere . luckily we acted quickly or else a bunch of carpet would have been ruined . they feel really cheap too . if you only want to use them a few times , get them , i know we will never get these again
0	ordered this item as a gift for my daughter..arrived quickly and did not appear broken or used but would not work at all..appliance would not activate.. very disappointing ... probably why it was such a deal..shipping was as much as the item ! valentine surprise failed
0	okay , i bought for the price . and it is effective enough . but it is very clumsy and unergonomic , so that after a couple minutes of use it is difficult to handle any longer . the main problems are : balance of weight , and the switch . first , the switch : because it is a cheap push-in button , which must be constantly depressed to keep the knife on , you lose optimum control quickly . the handle is badly placed for this , as your thumb must always be on top of the handle and forward toward the front of it , but you ca n't hold your hand up there because your wrist angle will be completely wrong for cutting . in addition , keeping that button depressed is difficult not only because it does require a constant application of pressure at a different direction from both the grasp and the application of the knife , but because the button sinks deep into the handle , so your thumb is inside the handle as you 're trying to hold and control the knife : quick cramp . moreover , as you 're pushing it in , if the food you 're cutting is moist ( like a turkey ) , juices may run onto the handle , your thumb -- and into the hole into which you 're pressing the button . not safe . a couple times i 've wondered whether that shooting pain in my thumb was from nerve torture or electric shock ; either way , it was n't good . then the weight distribution of the knife is not very good . look at the huge bulk of the motor -- and then look at where the handle is located , and how it is designed . there 's no way to hold this at a proper angle with the handle shaped as it is . add in the need to be depressing the power button as you 're holding it awkwardly , and ... 2 stars for effectiveness ; minus 3 for bad functional design
1	i bought a bed a few months ago and had to go out and buy new bedding at some local stores . i hated having to shop around and wish i would have seen a set like this . because i went from a queen bed to a king size - i had to buy new pillows , mattress pad , comforter , sheets , etc . i looked around and if you add up the pieces in the 10 piece set its a great value - plus much easier to buy all at once . i highly recommend this set for anyone upgrading their mattress . i was not able to buy the king size set - but did buy a twin set for my niece as a back to school gift . cheers ! ste
1	my cats love this ! they will play with it by themselves or with each other . it is a little wobbly for my big fat male cat , but he still loves to play on it .
0	i baked six loaves in this machine . i have been using various bread machines for the past 12 years and feel comfortable making adjustments when things do n't turn out just right . my big complaint with this machine is the low baking temperatures . even on the darkest crust setting and the longest baking time ( 70 minutes ) , my loaves were only marginally acceptable - they were not sufficiently baked . i was using a nearly-whole wheat recipe . the machine was quiet , strong , and had a lot of bells and whistles , but with only partially baked bread , i had to return it to amazon . amazon shipped it to me in a very poorly packed box which was gaping open when it arrived , but they included return labels which made it a cinch to send back , and were quick enough with the refund
1	these are called `` fruit bowl '' but they are the perfect size for a couple of scoops of ice cream
0	somehow i stumbled onto this item while searching for `` quiet '' and `` fan '' . now that i review the item description i do n't see any mention of `` quiet '' . oops . the fan 's primary flaw is that it only has two speeds , both of which are insanely high . i do n't need such a mighty wind to just take the edge off of my over-heated workspace . a gentle breeze would be great . instead i have a choice between either a hurricane or a tornado . on the bright side , perhaps this product will bring about a resurgence of interest in the paper weight . and then , one day , frustrated over my choices between a sweltering office or a deafeningly loud fan , i can grab my largest paper weight and use it to break a window , thereby cooling the office naturally . everyone wins ! also , while the fan looks identical to the holmes fan pictured , it is branded as a `` westpointe '' . really . `` westpointe '' with two `` e '' s
1	i forgot the toy needed a battery so for the first few days my cats played with it without the bird moving around in circles , but mostly they ignored it . when i got the battery , and the bird started moving , my two older cats were n't impressed , but my youngest ( about 1 1/2 years ) went crazy . it 's pretty funny watching her with the toy ; she can get fairly worked up attempting to take out the bird . it 's also entertaining when she 's finished playing ; she has a tendency to walk away from it too slowly , which means she is hit in the backside by the bird . naturally , this starts the fight with the bird all over again . i 'm pretty sure the other cats will play with it as well , but even if it 's just the kitten , it 's worth the money
0	i would rate this item -0- star but it is not an option . there are too many styles/models . it is very confusing . check item specifics carefully to avoid getting the wrong style/model . this vacuum has stationary brushes . save your money and pay the difference for the models w/ spin-scrub
0	this blender died after 4 months of light use . i never asked it to crush ice or do anything really strenuous . i only used it to blend smoothies and tofu desserts - so the toughest thing it ever had to handle was a couple of half-frozen berries . after two months the motor started to have that burned smell when i used it . after three months the plastic bottom part of the canister started to crack . at four months , the motor started making funny noises , it smelled terrible , and the crack on the canister widened so that liquid started to spill out when in use . all in all , this blender was a total waste of money and ended up in the trash . i will never buy a hamilton beach product again
0	i wanted to buy something that would remove the taste of chlorine from the kitchen faucet but even with the brita it still tasted like chlorine . after about 2 weeks it started to drip from the where the brita screws into the faucet . so now you do n't have filtered water . my husband replaced washer and it still dripped . if you accidently put the hot water on while someone in the house just before used the filtered part the filter is ruined
1	this set is a great way to get a few basic cookware pieces , however , once you start cooking with this truly outstanding cookware , you 'll want to buy more . over the years , i have spent hundreds of dollars on another well-known commercial cookware brand , but all-clad is far superior . the stainless looks great and is a breeze to care for . the handles stay comfortable and the pots are really well-balanced , making them very easy to handle . they heat evenly and cook uniformly , even over low and medium heat . i am very pleased with all-clad 's performance on my radiant cooktop . i would recommend this line of cookware to anyone interested in quality and performance . well worth every penny
0	one might imagine that the whole concept of vacuuming-flip-mopping is progressive in some way , but it really does not make the job of cleaning the floor easier . especially when the product is heavy and hard to maneuver with poor pickup . i 'd much rather go over the floor with a good vacuum , and then follow with a functional , well-designed good mop ( like the old steammop they discontinued ) . these things function better as seperate units , which is why there 's no washing machine that 's also a dryer . the flip-it is a very loud machine -- so loud , that i did n't hear my phone ring in the same room . this makes it difficult to listen for my 3 children , too . it 's difficult to push and feels like it 's gripping to the floor . it does n't fit into any tight places or under any low chairs/cabinets with it 's big fat part-vacuum head . and , when you 're finished , it 's a pain to clean out the nozzle and the filter ( which you 're supposed to keep dry somehow ) so you can look forward to a second job once you 've finished the job of cleaning your floors . and , because of the `` flip it '' back and forth design , the thing has no equilibrium ... it fell to the floor at least 3 times , even when i was so careful to rest it against something ... once when this happened , the `` dirty water '' recovery tank hit the floor , fell off the machine and spilled the dirty water all over my just-cleaned floor . a true nightmare . i bought this product because i could no longer buy replacement filters/pads for my bissell steammop , and i thought i had better give the latest and greatest a try , but , sadly , i was disappointed . i do n't review things often , but i felt a responsibility to warn others out there who are shopping for a good mop to keep their homes clean . this contraption is not your answer . on a side note , i wrote to bissell to bring back the steammop ( what an excellent product ) , so i 'm hoping that they will one day
1	this is just what i was looking for . i use it for the few dishes that do n't make it in to the dishwasher , but mostly for drying the baby bottles . the bottle drying systems are pretty ugly and can only be used for that purpose . this drying rack is very useful for the bottles and dishes
0	sometimes it sprays when she barks , most of the time it does n't . so i would say its effectiveness has been rather low . it 's not the battery or the fill level - maybe it just depends on the dog . i can bark into it myself and it sprays just fine . ( my children found this amusing .
0	this is an ugly vase . so ugly we are returning it the day we received it . it does not measure up to mikasa standards at all . it looks and feels like a cheap vase one would buy at target . we were very disappointed . stick to the clean , lean lines of other mikasa crystal vases
1	so far , so good . i have a 3mo shep that so far has a blast with this thing . i saw one reviewer that said it tore apart , and will update as time goes by . so far i love them ... .well , she loves them . easy for her to pick up , when the ball is much larger than her mouth ( holes in ball ) the football shaped one bounces in odd directions , but highly recommend the blue one , as dogs see blue well ( color blind )
0	this is a great maker for american coffee drinkers who have the occasional espresso . this will not pass for a full-time espresso drinker . the machine functions fine but the coffee is not robust enough to be called true espresso
1	the quality of the china is very good . the weight and feel of the product is substantial . i was disappointed in the color and antique look to them . from the pictures i thought the color was going to be more of a buttercream yellow rather than ivory white and the antiquing more attractive . they almost look dirty instead of antiqued but the price is right and they are certainly adequate for every day use for my family
1	i 've read a number of complaints about food sticking and difficulty with cleaning . we 've experienced neither of these - make sure the heat is not too high and clean with hot water ! it 's a great saucepan and the price was great . highly recommended
1	it 's kinda hard to imagine dimention on a non standart object . it works , and cleans , i guess a bit small , but for the money its well worth i
1	i bought one of these from a yard sale for use at my small office . i was getting stuck cleaning up the kitchen and decided to see if this little unit was worth it . i 'd looked at the small haier unit and was not impressed with the plastic interior . i broke a lot of rules setting this up . its not connected to the hot water supply , since i have a very old sink and the only other connection i had was to cold water lines . also , the machine is on the floor , under the sink . i bought new hoses to make the connections . luckily , the standard connectors on the back made this easy - the fill is a standard clothes washer fill line , and the drain can take a piece of garden hose . i was concerned with the garden hose holding up to very hot wash drain water , but so far its been okay . ( if i was installing this anyplace else or using this in my home , i might not be so nonchalant . ) my unit was used , from an area where there was very hard water , and the previous owners had never cleaned the innards of the machine . i soaked everything in clr to remove the scale from the sump grill , the heating element and the wash arm , and cleaned the gunk out from under the door seal , and away we went . since we are in an office , we always use the sanitary wash to keep the cooties down . the machine does an excellent job of getting even cold tapwater super hot , and the dishes will flash dry after the cycle is over , if you pop the door open . the machine has no problem pumping wastewater through the drain line and up 3 feet into the sink . one reason i avoided the plastic tub haier is noise . if you load this machine carefully , you can prevent items from clinking against each other too much , and the machine will operate more quietly . we 've found that we can run the machine , have the office radio on , and still comfortably make phone calls without much trouble . my only complaints would be that on occasion , the timer has gotten stuck ( once or twice in 100 washes ) . also , some plastic items have been slightly warped by the heater . capacity is very decent , probably because the machine is pretty large . measure first
0	this steamer performs very poorly . the wrinkles in my shirts just laughed when they saw it coming . now it sits in my closet collecting wasting space
0	the thing did not work right from the beginning and now the tail fell off would not recommend it to anyon
1	i recently purchased the sakura embossed palm 16 pc . dinnerware set for my mom for christmas . she absolutely loves them . they are so unique and when she has company over for dinner gets many compliments on them . nobody has ever seen dinnerware like these before . she is a big fan of palm trees and these fit her collection nicely
1	i think these little candle holders are great for any occasion . and they are n't expensive either . therefore you can buy any color for any occasion to match any room in your house . these can be used for formal occasions or just everyday use
1	i 'm impressed with the quality of these towels . i purchased them because i needed hunter green and could not find that color locally . they are large , soft absorbent towels
1	very nice peeler except it 's missing a feature that every other peeler i 've ever seen has ; a protuberance that can be used to remove the eyes from potatoes
0	i ordered this teapot because at the time it came with a free tea infuser . when it arrived , the teapot was broken , with a large section missing from the side . i returned it and had to pay the shipping to the company to reorder the same item after i received a refund only for the items price . after receiving my second teapot , it was cracked in the exact same spot . i returned the product and complained with no response . i was refunded the price for the teapot , but i am out $ 10 in the cost of shipping . it seems highly unlikely that two teapots would break in the exact same spot , so i would try a different product .
0	i do not think that the batteries were fresh . does n't seem to bother my dog when he barks
0	this towel start falling apart after one wash and a tumble dry on low -- one inch strings were sticking out all over the surface and little balls of frabric ( like dust-bunnies ) formed on it too . perhaps it would be good to use as an oil rag , but not in one 's bathroom
0	this is a lemon/lime press . the oranges in china must be real small , so if your planning on pressing oranges make sure they are small and forget about grapefruit
1	we bought this hand blender to get rid of the problems created by the power cord on our braun corded hand blender . the cuisinart took care of the problem . pros : very good power for blending , good battery charge life , easy to clean , clever modular construction ( battery separates from motor , built-in plug and charger ) , does not roll off counter . cons : larger and heavier than the corder braun . this blender may be difficult to use for people with small hands . very short people may also find use difficult as the blender is over 16 '' long . the surface finish of the plastic housing is very smooth , making clean-up easy . i do n't recommend washing the blending head in the dishwasher as this smooth surface may be degraded over time . the heat of the dishwasher may also degrade the rubber seal around the blender shaft . hand washing is easy and quick . one reviewer suggested that cuisinart 's recommendation of leaving the battery pack/charger assembly plugged in all the time was bad for nicad batteries . this may shorten the battery life , but the charger charges them at a very slow rate ; this protects the batteries from what really damages them : heat from fast charging . as the charger draws only 1 watt of current , some may want to leave it plugged in continuously . current recommendations for care of nicad batteries is to run them down until they no longer supply useful power . do n't run them down completely as was the practice in the past . the cuisinart batteries will charge fully overnight . they do n't feel warm to the touch and this slow charging rate will extend their useful life
1	this mug absolutely comes through as promised . hot beverages stay hot even hours later . it 's totally leak proof and easy to disassemble for cleaning . i am very pleased with this purchase ! the only thing that i am not completely satisfied with is it 's size . i would have preferred something a little wider , but the ability to fit in any drink holder is what the manufacturer was going for ... ..unfortunately it tends to move around in mine , but it does n't spill any thing
0	i have owned a few oxo brand utensils over the past few years , and in general i have been happy with them . but i was disappointed with this spatula when the edge of the head melted the very first time it was used . the product description does warn you that it 's only heat resistant to 250 degrees , but i was flipping eggs in a skillet , which i consider a basic use for a spatula . if it ca n't handle the heat of a hot skillet , than i do n't think it 's a useful spatula . not to mention that it 's neither healty nor esthetically pleasing to have bits of black plastic in your food
1	if you want the retro look and a super toaster ... ..this is the one for you . toasts perfectly and looks great ! i 've had it about 4 months with no problems whatsoever . make sure to measure your countertop area before ordering ... ..it 's a big toaster . shape is unusual ( taller in back than the front ) which gives it a little character ! excellent !
0	i have two cats both less than 5 months old . i bought citikitty training kit hoping it would save me from scooping the litter box . it turned out a piece of flimsy junk that 's way over priced . my cats would rather do their business anywhere but on this piece of plastic . save your money and use it on something more useful
0	the machine looks great . it sat nicely on our counter-top next to the kitchen aid mixer and looked really classy . if that was all i wanted to do with it , then i would have been very happy with it , but i actually wanted to make decent lattes and espressos . firstly , i found the steamer wand to be awkward to use . it rotates , but has little movement up or down . as a result , i found it pretty impossible to steam milk without spilling some on the counter-top when i was finished . it produced good foam though . secondly , the indicator lights are so dim i found it difficult to tell whether the machine was ready or not . finally the espressos i made had no crema at all . i have been making them for 3 years with our current saeco machine with a delightful crema on each one . after pulling the shot it continued to leak water from the filter holder . the machine was constantly leaking water steam when it got up to temperature and the design of the drip tray is such that it is awkward to empty it without spilling everywhere . in summary : if you just want a pretty machine to sit on your counter , buy this machine . if you want to make decent espresso-based drinks , do n't
1	i searched for a long time before i purchased this product and have not regretted my decision to buy . like all ice crushers it is a little noisy .
0	first i liked this press - good coffee , reasonable price . but in 3 weeks operation , the press itself has already broken . the plastic holder for mesh filter has broken ... may be this pres is good for ones a year usage , but not for everyday ...
0	we bought this rice cooker because of the reputable brand name . we have been using it for about 4 months now . it cooks good rice . however , the rice does not stay fresh for over 3 days sometimes regardless of what other reviewers said . we 've got spoiled rice in it a few times already with no understandable reason . and the rice was in `` keep warm '' mode at all times . in addition , if you forget to stir the rice and leave it in the `` keep warm '' mode for a day , the top layer becomes very hard and the bottom layer becomes very soggy . so , you do need to stir the rice quite often to prevent the dryout . i have n't tried cooking porridge or any other kind of rice besides white rice . if i were to decide all over again , i would stay away from this rice cooker . i thought i 've bought a top-notched product , now i regret that i spent this much on a rice cooker
1	this dish rack fits into small spaces and holds a decent capacity of plates , etc . perfect for a small apartment kitchen ! love it !
1	my 13-year-old cat was limping for a few days , off and on , and my vet said it was probably arthritis . a friend had told me that giving her arthritic dog nutramax cosequin had helped him , and i already knew that regular cosequin has helped me with my arthritis , so i bought a box of nutramax cosequin for cats from my vet for my kitty to try . it really made a difference ! he stopped limping and could walk farther and faster on our walks together around our lake . he was so happy , and so was i . on my vet 's recommendation , i continued giving him one tuna-flavored capsule each day , sprinkled over his food , as a good preventative to slow further joint deterioration , all without the side effects which he might have gottten from prescription medication . i would highly recommend this product for cats and dogs as a first line of treatment for arthritis ; and buying it from amazon saved me about 2/3 of the cost from the vet .
0	this waterer is a great concept , but does have some drawbacks . for starters , one of my dogs is scared to death of it and wont come near it because when the water level in the bowl gets low it gurgles just like a water cooler at work . the first time it happened she was drinking out of it and it freaked her out and now wont go near it . the other dog is just fine with it , but then again he 's deaf , so the gurgle does n't bother him . lol . the other issue i had with this is just like all water bowls , it gets dirty . so you still have to clean it as often as you would any other water bowl , but it 's a bit more cumbersome having to take the big jug off , clean the bowl and but the jug back on . so , if your dog is n't afraid of the noise it makes and you do n't mind the extra hassle cleaning it , it 's great . otherwise , just get a large bowl ; that 's what i ended up having to do
1	my dog absoluely loves this toy . we have had one since she was a puppy , over 6 years ago , and its still going . this is the only toy that she will play with for hours on end and gets excited when she see it . definitely worth buying , it gives great excercise . we sometimes use it as a distraction when our dog gets anxious
1	i received this knife for christmas after reading the review in cook 's illustrated magazine and then requesting it on my gift list ! my son ordered it through amazon and it arrived before christmas . it is now my favorite knife and is used daily . after cutting veggies , fish , meats , and fruit , this knife continues to be extremely sharp , well balanced , and easy to use . what a great gift
1	the riedel syrah/shiraz wine glasses are a nice combination of fine glassware , yet also have a sturdy feel
1	i have tried all kinds of feather pillows and foam pillows but just could not get comfortable sleeping on my side . while shopping for a new mattress , i came across the simmons beautyrest pillow . what a difference ! it provides great support but is still soft and comfortable . now i do n't toss and turn all night , and i actually get up earlier in the morning and feel rested for the first time in a long time . i definitely recommend this pillow for people who sleep on their side and are looking for good support
0	the towel is quite soft , however after using it , your body will be covered with small fibers all over . - not recommended
0	i bought this for my husand as a gift and it is awful . it fell apart the first time we used it . it even caught his hand when it fell apart and drew blood . i do not recommend this product at all .
0	the other commentators stress features of this kettle that pretty much any cordless electric kettle will have . it pales in comparison to my old hamilton beach , however , in several respects . well , really , one big one . it 's a plastic object . and it gets very hot . too hot . hot enough that it smells like it 's melting itself . i got this as a gift , rinsed it thorougly , boiled a pot just to clean it - and it stunk like melted plastic . ran it again to try and get the smell out . same thing . rinsed it with cold water and tried again - still melted odor . the outside of the kettle near the heating element was very hot even after it shut off ( a problem i did n't have with my previous kettle , which i lost in a move ) , and when i touched it a melted plastic film tacked on to my finger . you can bet i put this right in the mail back to amazon . i normally would hesitate to return a gift , but i 'd rather the person have his money back than this thing sit on my counter collecting dust
1	i 've had my juicer now for about 3 years , and i have n't had any problems with it . in fact , after having had several juicers , this one is my favorite in the price range . i also do n't understand the customer service problems . one of the rubber feet on the bottom split , and i called customer service . a week later i had four new ones in the mail ! pros - much quieter than most juicers of its type . as well , i did a side by side comparison with my buddie 's juiceman juicer , and my yield was approximately 30 % greater . cons - as with any other similar juicer , cleaning it gets old . that 's probably the only think that keeps me from using it multiple times/day
0	i would not use this unless it had a featherbed on top . i have two other waterproof pads from bloomingdales that are more expensive but much softer
0	the pans look very nice and very durable-but they are not ! ! ! save your money do not buy this ! ! ! i had to put them through the dishasher a second time to remove some more of the sticky residue on the bottom of the pan from the label . when they came out of the dishwasher there were rust spots all over them . i am going to try and return mine as soon as i get a chance . i never even got to use the pans before they rusted . it should be noted that a ) the pans were never left soaking in water or in the sink b ) there was not anything even the tiniest bit rusty in the dishwasher with them to have `` rubbed off '' rust onto them or anything like that . horrible , horrible pans-they should be ashamed to make or sell these ! !
1	i received the 10 pc set from my husband for christmas . i have been very pleased with the quality and how easy they are to clean after use . some veg did stain the bottom of the saucepans . maybe this will disappear if tomatoes are cooked in them . the pans take longer to heat up because of the thickness and the weight but once they are hot they cook evenly . i feel we made a good choice
0	i am extremely happy with this product . it works like a charm for making pancakes and they never ever stick . it 's a superb design and i am very pleased . i would highly recommend it
0	i returned them beacause they are nothing like the good old revereware made in the u.s.a.they are very thin and cheap.i do not recommend anyone buying them , you willonly want to return them
0	while the water tasted better , this model did n't last for more than about two months before leaking and eventually spraying water all over the place
0	i have sold a number of this style timer made by kitchenaid in pink , black and white . almost every buyer complained . all complaints were that the ring is not loud enough to hear if you are in another room , have a fan on or are listening to the tv or radio . replacing the battery does not remedy the problem either . if you want a kitchenaid timer invest in one of the red , black , blue , white or tangerine ones that are entitled digital timer with rotating dial - no one has any complaints over this style of kitchenaid timers .
1	i bought this chocolate fountain for a 3rd grade class valentine 's day party . it was the talk of the whole school . the kids loved it . i used sephra chocolate ( a coupon was included ) , so i did n't have to mess with adding any oil . the chocolate fountain worked great and left quite an impression . the cascading , flowing , chocolate was n't quite as perfect as the pictures on the box , but it probably would have if i would have added a teenie bit of oil , but the pure sephra chocolate tasted devine . i also saved $ 25.00 by buying the chp ( champaigne color ) version
1	these mikasa spoons go perfectly with your demitasse or espresso cups . very delicate with nice finish . we enjoy them every time we use them
0	i am very disappointed with this humidifier and its filter . it consumes about 1 filter per month and if you keep the humidifier off for more than 2 days the filter dries up and you might as well throw it away
1	i really like these glasses . they are attractive and pleasant to hold . i prefer having a wine glass that does n't contain a lot of wine - which is why i got these since they are the smallest in this line
1	i love that it has a mini bowl . so much less storage . also it runs so much more quiet than my old hamilton beach . i am so impressed . love kitchen aid anything
1	this sharpener is exactly what i hoped for . i have used it enough to overcome the learning curve and am very well pleased
0	i 'm a student in college , and when my first hamper ripped , i decided that it was time to buy a sturdier hamper . my roommate rarely does his laundry , so he has huge loads , but his hamper manages to carry it all . i saw the whitney design hamper online , which looked nearly identical to my roommate 's hamper , so i bought it . when the hamper arrived , i put my clothes in it , and prepared to do laundry . the shoulder strap ripped right off . i did n't even fill up the hamper all the way , as is shown in the picture . amazon sent me a replacement , but now i am afraid of using the shoulder strap again , and i have to awkwardly grasp the sides around the metal wires . this hamper may be able to function , but not well . and for a college student , this is definitely not sturdy enough
0	had this grinder for 8 months . two large cracks have formed in the side of the unit , now they are widening and trapping lots of coffee grounds . i 'm tossing it and getting a different brand . all form , no function
0	read the fine ( or missing ) print carefully . this is not a general purpose vacuum purchase . you need to buy the carpet attachment to be able to vacuum carpets ( another $ 100 ) . if you want to return this item , they charge a restocking fee of 10 % and also deduct for the shipment ( even if you got `` free '' shipping ) and you pay to ship the thing back . we ended up buying locally from sears and are much happier with it than from central vacuum stores - which is where the miele came from .
0	this coffeemaker does not keep coffee hot and fresh for hours as the user booklet says , even if you first fill the carafe with hot water and let it set before brewing . if you want a cup 45 minutes after brewing , it is luke-cold ! i was emptying the carafe right after brewing into another thermal carafe that actually keeps coffee hot just to avoid reheating cup after cup in the microwave ! it is hard to clean and very loud
1	very good rice cooker . the steam function is very useful for such a lazy student like me . i can cook the rice and steam my food at the same time . i used it for almost a month but still working functionally . highly recommended if you dun wan na pay too much for a useful rice cooker
1	i internet shopped for a week , reading consumer reports and customer reviews of just about every blender made . i decided on this one based on my research and i am glad i did . i make my husband fruit and juice smoothies almost every day after work and with this machine it is a fast , easy job . ice and frozen fruit are blended into the drink very quickly . it is a little loud but it is worth the noise to have 500 watts of power . i also like the fact the base is heavy cast metal , the pitcher is thick , solid glass with a tight fitting lid and the blade is stainless . i like the easy to use control knob and the fact it has 2 , yes just 2 speeds . i find most machines with 12 to 20 little buttons are fairly useless and all those speeds rarely used , they also take up more counter space because the bases have to be bigger for all the buttons . the fact that the hamilton beach comes in 6 colors is just icing on the cake and the moroccan red is gorgeous .
1	i 'm very happy with this mixer . it arrived in pristine condition , even though the box it was shipped in looked very tired and worn . the machine does what i ask of it with no glitches or complaints . i bought it mainly for bread making , and after a certain amount of practice , i 'm turning out great products . i also have discovered that scoop shaped measuring cups work wonderfully for adding flour and other ingredients , so i think i will pass on the idea of purchasing a splatter guard . my only gripe is not with the machine , but probably with amazon because i did not get the model that was pictured . i got the hd . i have researched as much as i can , and the machine i received is probably identical to the one i thought i was getting , but i just do n't understand what is so difficult about matching the picture with the product that one is buying . seems kind of elementary to me
0	the armoire arrived with the doors damaged and a nick on the top . i was sent new doors but they did n't fit . frustrated , i accepted the promised $ 175.00 off to keep the doors , knowing they would have to be repaired by my husband later . i have yet to receive this refund . the delivery was also a major problem . there was only one guy and he said he was told to leave the furniture in the driveway and go . there was no way i could get this furniture in my house alone , so i tipped him to bring it in for me . i will never buy anything from this company again ! ! ! ! ! !
0	i had high hopes for this nightlight after reading other reviews , but it is n't so hot . the light is n't very bright and quite diffused , and the light sensor is n't sensitive enough - it stays on in all but the brightest light . i ordered two , but have only opened one , and the other is likely to stay in its packaging
1	it does everything i need it to and more ! i 'm a raw foodist so i do n't need something that will `` cook '' foods like some of the other high-powered blenders will . however , if that 's what you need one for , this will do that , too . the l'equip is the only blender i have ever used without the lid ( not advised for households with children ) . i can start it out at a crawl and go up to blindingly fast with a turn of the knob . i liked my original one so much that i bought one to have at the office so my green smoothies could be made fresh for lunch . alton brown was showing off his appliances on `` good eats '' and he has a l'equip , too . made me feel famous
1	these are gorgeous bowls . they are my preferred bowl for baking and cooking . i am very satisfied with them - no discoloration problems and they clean up very easily . and they look fantastic on my pot rack
1	this is the cutest comforter , not the softest , buy my son loves it ! i had n't been able to get him to sleep in his own bed all night but as soon as we got this it was no problem . he loves to sleep in his 'thomas ' bed !
1	i love the large size of these tumblers , as i can get a whole can of pop with ice in them . the thermal feature works good , the ice lasts longer , and they do n't sweat , so i do n't need coasters under them . they are colorful , so each guest can have their own color , no mix ups . they fit on the top rack of my dishwasher , and they do n't seem to be marked or scratched yet . after seeing mine , my daughter-in-law got some , as did two sets of my friends . i am so glad to have found them !
1	have had the granos for about 1 month . great espresso , great latte and great design . i hope all the leak issues i read below have been solved , but only time will tell .
1	perfect for anybody who appreciates no-frills , straight lined , attractive furniture . it 's modern and sturdy and a great match for my kitchen dinette set . i love it ! and the price is right , too
0	sure , it looks nice enough without anything on it . but if you plan to actually hang coats and umbrellas on it , pick something else . it 's tippy and it does n't hold very many coats without the pegs cracking and breaking off . it 's cheap , but you 're getting less than what you pay for . it could n't last a winter when being used by only two people
0	while the wine pourer works as advertised i am disappointed that the company appears to have discontinued the wine stopper i was originally seeking . i was after the pourer that came with a `` flapper '' at the top that acted to preserve the freshness of the wine in between tastings . while the above item fits the bill as a spout i personally find it useless
0	i bought this item - `` drinkwell fresh water fountain and reservoir for cats or small dogs - fountain ( 6 cup capacity ) '' from petsmart at amazon . though the title clearly advertises that a reservoir is included , one did not arrive . i contacted customer service who told me that the reservoir is not included and would only assist me in ordering one . otherwise , the unit is nice , though simple . i will be returning it used to purchase elsewhere
1	i used this skillet for the first time and it was great . i love cast iron but the enamel coating sure made this easier to use . it cleaned quickly and required no seasoning . also , its a really pretty skillet . the sellers were really good also about emailing with order status updates , shipping info and the skillet came quickly through fed ex . very good customer service
0	after just a few months of occasional use the lever to lower the bread would not stay down . i see now that others have had this problem . typical `` made in china '' junk . no more t-fal for us
0	when we first bought it , it worked nicely and smoothly . thought we do not need to buy another opener again . boy were we wrong ! after the third use , it will open only a small gap and the handle will just keep spinning . reminds me of a car turning it 's wheels will all smoke and noise but no results . glad we still kept our old opener from a much lesser known brand . this opener certainly does damage to the kitchenaid name
1	i think i 'm a little crazy for buying this . i just had to find out if the copper-core was really better than an aluminum one . it is , but not by that much . you can buy a pan from cuisinart 's multiclad series that will do the same thing almost as well for a much cheaper price . that being said , this thing is very well designed . the rolled-lip is useful for pouring . the radius of curvature where the bottom meets the sides is large enough to allow for utensils to easily get in there ( a problem with most pans ) . the handle stays cool and is well designed . overall , this is the best 2-quart saute pan money can buy . is it worth it ? that 's up to you
0	its a throw . like a blanket . i would have been better off with a pretty cutain to think of it . it would be better than what i wasted my money on . also dont wash this with anything else . the die leaks
1	this came to me just in time to solve several cooking applications that have been bothering me since the holidays . as a lasagna pan it is the perfect depth to make a stellar presentation . as a roasting pan it works well and holds a small turkey or two 3 lb . chickens . it 's also good for a large casserole for a pot luck . the pan looks good from oven to table . yes - it is heavy to work with because of the cast iron , but i 'm really glad to add this to my pantry .
1	there was no dimensions on the description so i took a chance . it was a bit smaller than i thought ( about 2.5 '' cubic ) , but that happens to work out perfectly for my purposes . it is lovely , and the color really adds to the kitchen . my guests all loved it
0	you never ever use an electric wok to cook chinese food . it is all about the fire and the intensity of the heat . only people that use this are people whom have no idea what they 're doing . do yourself a favor and purchase a real wok
0	i bought this for my mom and had it sent to her address . it worked for two days and then it stopped . on my last visit i fiddled with it for an hour , but it only worked intermittently . she did n't keep the receipt so i 'm writing it off as a waste of money . when you think about it the inexpensive softsoap brand push pump dispensers make more sense . you can see when they are empty and you do n't have to keep up with batteries . i do n't buy the argument that the hands-free dispenser is more sanitary than the hand pumps because after you touch the hand pump you wash your hands
1	for $ 19.99 , you 'll not find many knife sets . i paid that for one kitchen aid santoku knife ! this set includes a long slicer/utility knife , one large paring knife , and a 5 or 6 '' serrated knife . the knives consist of good steel , comfortable grips , and are well balanced . they are very sharp and sturdy . i could n't find a better set for the price . i was looking for a decent utility/carving knife and a large paring knife when i found this set . i use mine as the `` disposable '' knives . for this price , you wo n't have to worry about beating up on them . and they sharpen up quickly , too . the red color is very festive . the grips feel like silicon , so they work when wet and greasy . and pleasantly squish when you grip hard . if you are in the market for a fine , high level kitchen knife , these may not fit the bill . but if you are looking for good quality , inexpensive knives , you wo n't find better in this price range . i paid $ 19.99 dec-200
0	the seals are not air or water tight . there is no problem with the cansiter or the clear window , but i can not store any flour or rice type products as the seals are not airtight and allow bugs in them . the canisters themselves do not rust and the lids are not easy to remove
1	this is wonderful . i have arthritis and my sister got the litter maid , but that ended up having to be scooped on a regular basis which was hard on me . i actually enjoy working with this . the only drawback is sometimes smaller clumps of litter can get stuck below the drawer , but using really good litter , and not too much of it stops that . i told my sister she should replace her own litter maid with this
0	after reading the reviews on this product i thought it would be a great space heater for my apt . i could n't have been more wrong . it barely gets hot - even on the highest setting - and gives off almost no heat ! ! perhaps mine is defective or got broken during shipping , but it was a huge waste of money . i have had to go out an buy another space heater already . it is so frustrating . one word - do n't !
1	i just received this griddle today and am so disappointed to find on the small print on the box ( and not in amazon 's description ! ) that this griddle can not be used on ceramic top stoves . it 's a beautiful piece of cookware , heavyweight and with grease pour spouts at the edges . exactly what i wanted , but very unfortunate that amazon does n't tell you that it wo n't work with some stoves . the warning on the box actually says that using this griddle on a ceramic stove can break the ceramic top . probably would have given it 5 stars if i could have used it
1	it is hard to find spoons for tall drinks . these are excellent quality- nice heft and good looking as well . highly recommend
1	using a chemex requires water to be heated in a tea kettle prior to brewing , and it requires a finer ground than what auto-drip machines ask for . after the water is brought to a boil , it 's important to wait for it to cool just slightly ( about 30 seconds ) and then you need to wet the grounds in the filter , wait for them to drain , and then fill the pot with water . want more than a single cup of coffee ? you wait for your first pour to brew , and then fill the filter again . some advantages over other forms of coffee brewing : 1 . taste : i do n't know how it does it , but the filter does keep your coffee from being bitter . 2 . cleanability : users can keep all necessary components clean ( anyone who 's brewed water and vinegar through their coffee maker to kill off a bitter taste that was n't there when you bought it understands this plight ) . oftentimes , the most aggressive criticism of the chemex is its ponderousness to clean because it 's not possible to get your hand into the reservoir . some people prefer to add hot water and soap and give it a good rinse , which is fine if you clean the moment you empty the pot , but if you 're like me and you let the remaining sip or two sit until a nice coffee stain is on the glass , then you need some good 'ol fashion friction to get it clean . the best thing i 've found : a baby bottle cleaner . it 's narrow enough to get into the reservoir and the angle can be adjusted to scrap the walls , too . brilliant ! 3 . electricity free : as long as you can boil water , you can have coffee . 4 . mud/sludge : french press and stove-top espresso-style brewing always leaves a thick slime at the bottom of an otherwise rich cup of coffee . do n't get me wrong : i think that 's good ( i use a french press when i 'm in the mood ) , but the cone on a chemex does n't allow that at all . 5 . style/size : the chemex coffee pot is a relic ( designed in the 40s ) and the wood cuff with rawhide tie screams simplicity and elegance and it 's a wonderful , minimalist sight on any kitchen counter ( and unlike electric coffee makers , easy to move if you need the space ) . some drawbacks any purchaser should consider : 1 . time : it does take 5 - 10 minutes of labor to get the morning cup of coffee . 2 . cones : you ca n't run over to wal-mart when you use the last filter ; you need to find a specialty store or go online , which means you need to plan ahead . 3 . cold coffee : no electric hot plate ( thank god ) means coffee not poured and consumed immediately gets cold quickly . you can buy a wire guard and a glass lid so your chemex can be warmed on the stovetop . i think that 's more labor added to an already laborious endeavor . just have a warmed thermos ready and use that to store any unused coffee . 4 . learning curve : it does take some time to get the grind right , the amount right and the water level right to find a cup which caters to your tongue . 5 . cleanability : i know this is in the advantages column , as well , but it 's worth mentioning that a lot of people hate cleaning these things . to submerge it does mean pulling off the wood cuff ( which is a small pain ) else it will get nasty over time
1	i bought this knife and block set as a christmas gift for my wife . she loves it . our only disappointment was that the block was a different style than that shown on amazon or , for that matter , on the box it arrived in . the picture showed a block with six slots for steak knives . the block we got is the one now shown in the amazon add . apparently henckel made a change in their set about the same time i ordered it . we can live with the substitution though as the knive set is now selling for $ 50 more than what i paid for it in december 03 . i would have bought the set regardless of the block design but the steak knive slots was a nice feature that appealed to me . the knives are well crafted , have a great feel , extremely sharp and we love them . there were two extra slots in the block that accomodated another henckel knife we already owned and one other . we also love the selection of knives , especially the paring knife and small serrated knife . some other reviewers have mentioned scratches or uneven sharpening but we 've not noticed either of these conditions
1	the price was excellent . ordering was quick and easy . delivery was prompt . the high quality of the muffin rings was matched by their performance in the kitchen . they performed flawlessly on my electric griddle .
0	i tried this knife at sur la table at the furi demo . they appeared to be very sharp . however i did not like these knives for the following reasons 1 ) i dont care much for the cheap plastic-like orange handles 2 ) the finish on the knives appear to be cheap . furi implies that these knives are made in germany . however they are cheaply `` made in china '' . now generally i dont care that much .. everything is now made in china anyways.. but when i am paying so much money for a product , i was hoping it was made in germany or usa . 3 ) the case is even more cheaply made . personally , i would wait for a sale on the global or the wustof knives
1	i read a few not so favorable reviews , mostly stemming from problematic attachment of the stand ( which mine does not suffer ) , but i decided to order it anyway , figuring the potential upside eclipses any issues with the stand ( you can also wall mount it ) . well it has paid off , as the magnets work as promised , the tines stay sealed tight , and the tops rotate to open two different sized outlets for the spices . i pitched the included spices and filled it with my own . as for labels , there are many clear preprinted labels available for purchase here or elsewhere to accommodate your own spices . i honestly have never seen a better designed spice rack , and it has worked beautifully
0	i loved this vacuum initially . you can even see how much dirt it 's picking up ! however , the shape of the filter severely limits suction almost immediately , to where the vacuum wo n't pick up a speck of lint . you ahve to empty the filter every 5-10 minutes . i do not have a terribly messy household , just one with no stairs going to the front backyard
1	this bread tray is perfect plum ! ! the color is amazing , and the tray is so useful for so many things ! ! get several of these !
0	when i first got this item i loved it i used it 4 times and it stopped working
1	i overheard a flight attendant raving about the neckbones and also saw it reviewed highly in shape magazine . i still have not tried it in the car or on a flight , but am excited to . it does feel comfortable , though is bigger than expected , so pay attention to the dimensions before you buy
1	wow , this salter kitchen scales is highly accurate . i always get a perfect bake everytime . i definitely recommend this product . you 'll never be disapointed with its quality .
1	this toaster makes the best toast of any toaster i have ever owned and it looks great ! i tossed my blue plastic cuisinart , which at best made mediocre toast , and had that icky plastic worn out look . this toaster is metal , sturdy and has a great retro look in today 's colors . mine is red . i also bought the matching coffeemaker and the drink mixer - a quick and cheap way to update the kitchen . amazon service has been great and with the $ 25 off i got some great buys
0	i had researched this product for juicing ability and power . i ended up buying this one and after using it *twice* the motor just shut off . i returned this product and waited 3 months for the replacement . i decided to try juicing carrots and celery , and after no more than 5 minutes the motor just shut itself off again . i might be able to forgive this if it was the only problem with it . if you are juicing small things , like berries , with larger vegetables/fruit the unit will get off balanced shake the top loose and damage the blade . i know i read these bad reviews and said , oh that wo n't happen to me ... but it did . i hope you choose a different juicer
0	i set it up for my dogs because they bark whenever they hear a noise or if someone rings bell , i have 3 dogs , i put it on and they went beserk , they started going after each other , i did n't hear anything myself , but i am quite sure the dogs did , like i said they acted very badly towards each other , the tone must have made them lash out like that . i can not use it anymore .
1	this is a mid-size whisk , not a full-size one . if you understand that you 'll be happy with it . it is a simple item , does what it is supposed to , and looks great doing it
0	i wanted a humidifier that was silent , but when i plugged this in , not only could i hear it from the other room , but it 's a high-pitched whine . i do n't know what to do about it . i think i 'll probably just return it for something different
0	the problem with this is that ( as it appears to me ) villaware has tried to cut corners by re-using all but the plates as it has on it 's panini grill ( which for the record is an excellent product - which i have given rave reviews ) . check out the panini grill - unless you had these products in front of you were able to open them up , you 'd never be able to tell the difference between them . i would say , do n't write off villaware products just because of one poor one , as i said i also own the panini grill love it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! however , do n't waste your money on this one - i hope villaware does right by their respected name pulls this off the market completely . one thing i will say , the `` audible warning sound '' that was mentioned in a previous review is actually a click - the same as the panini grill , but listen carefully or you 'll miss it
1	the best product ever ! i have 5 cats ... and let me tell you ... if it were n't for this product i would have gone insane a long time ago ( or i 'd just have a very stinky household ! ) have used it for a long time , and will continue to do
0	i was very hesitant to spend close to $ 160 on a single fry pan , but i had heard so many good things about all-clad and thought it would be a wise investment . for the first 6 months , the pan was great . i loved the large size and used it often . i was just about ready to invest in an entire set of all-clad cookware when my pan warped . i was using it on an electric stove as usual , and the pan just simply warped . i was thoroughly disappointed that a $ 160 pan would warp during normal use . i wo n't be spending this kind of money again . ****follow-up . i contacted all-clad regarding the warped pan-they had me send it in for evaluation , and yesterday a brand new one showed up at my door . i 'm impressed at their customer service and the fact that they stand behind their product .
1	i have never used any other dehydrator 's and found this very simple to use , clean , store , and the price was great . plus it makes my house smell great when i 'm using it . so far i have only dehydrated fruits and vegetables and still have to get used to how long to leave things in the machine and how to prep them however , the instructions really makes it very easy and overall i 'm finding it enjoyable to use .
0	i placed a substantial order , mattresses , sofa set , table set and cocktail tables with this vendor and they cancelled my shipment becuase the cost to deliver the items they said was `` too much '' nothing in their ads states they will cancel your order for such a reason and they state the shipping charge on the items and their site . this was a great inconvenience to me and i feel they are not a reputable dealer and do not conduct their business in an honorable fashio
1	i wish i would have bought the regular one instead of the paperback version . i love this light . i can see everything and do n't get the shadows hindering my reading . i prefer to read in bed and this allows me to do so without waking up dh
1	the refill accessory ( in both 50 and 70 oz sizes ) definitely cuts the refill-maintenance in half . since it doubles the capacity you only refill half as often . you still have to clean the fountain regularly as recommended . a different reviewer mentioned that the clear reservoir is not dishwasher-safe , and that warning is stated quite clearly in the manual . throwing caution to the wind i ignored the warning and now have an oddly-shaped container that with some squeezing still works as expected
1	we 've had this toaster for over a year and my family loves it . it toasts consistently . it accommodates all widths . and the digital selector is great
1	this worked as promised and turned out some very dainty little madelines- cute as a button ! it works the same as the large madeleine pans , and is made from the same heavy weight metal , but the result is darling . would be great for tiny `` garnish '' on a larger dessert , for a tea , or just because some people prefer small doses of good things !
1	love this product , excellent cheese cutter , three choices of thickness . highly recommended
0	my order was cancel because company will not ship to a fpo fp address , really unclear as to the reason , but i am sure it is a fine product , my turtles will continue to bask on their rock
1	love it that it keeps the butter soft and spreadable and fresh . this one holds a larger amount than others i have had . it is a bit more awkward to hold , however . it has a wide lid with no handle so you need to grab on to the sides of the lid to pick up . love the emile henry colors
0	this product is the worst there is . i purchased it in a target store going by the oster name . it takes forever for it to heat up and then another long wait for the waffle to be almost done . needless to say i am taking it back .
1	i got this for our 3-year-old daughter 's room as for some reason she does not seem to like the sound of a radiant heater . it does a decent job of boosting the heat level in the room , which she needs because she tends to kick off her blankets during the night . i would n't rely on this alone to heat a room unless it was a very small room . the top and back do get hot , although you 'd have to keep your skin in contact with it for several seconds to actually get burned ; bumping into it should not cause any burns . i have n't noticed any odors or noises from it
1	we bought this topper to replace a worn out topper of a different brand , that after 2+ years was no longer bouncing back into shape . this serta topper is just fine , as comfortable as our last one . my big complaint is that someone at serta ( though serta is n't the actual manufacturer ) needs to measure a queen sized bed , because this topper falls about an inch short on all 4 sides . if you place the topper in the included protective cover , it 's several inches short on all 4 sides . i know 1 inch sounds minor , but if you 're a stomach sleeper and tall enough where your feet hook off the end of the bed , the topper does n't protect you feet from the stiff edge of the mattress . as far as toppers in general , we have found that a huge advantage is the how much they help isolate movement across the bed . you do n't feel your partner moving around nearly as much with a topper ( though presumably with a full tempur bed isolates even more ) . definitely choose a topper with the highest density you can afford , and the thickest you can afford
0	i bought this item because other comforters from this seller had good reviews , but it was a complete mistake ! it really was dingy like described by other reviewer . i returned it , but lost over twenty five dollars in back and forth shipping costs for this item . i highly recommend against this product or seller
1	i bought this for my grandmother who cooks for two . it is small and compact enough to put in your cabinets and does n't take a lot of counter space while you are using it . its the perfect size to make pancakes , eggs and bacon ! we used it to make grilled cheese , and they came out perfect ! this would be great for singles , college students , and anyone who likes great things in small packages
1	the product came in a slightly damaged plastic cover pouch ... there was a smudged dirty smear across the damaged pouch area , which came out with laundering . other than that , the sheets are great . the lace needs starch and ironing . the fitted sheet fits over two twin beds that are made for individual remote adjustment positions of the mattresses , these two beds are put together to make a king bed . this product was a christmas gift and it was well received
1	this maker pours well and has a soft handle . we actually found one at a department store so we were able to see it in person before ordering it online . nice little coffee make
0	i returned this -- absolutely unusable . could not keep bottle engaged while pulling down the two rather unforgiving arms
0	i 've own my x3 for about 2 years now and overall , it has been used to make one double espresso daily . so when it stopped working a month ago , i was heartbroken . called ff , after some back and forth i sent the machine in for repair . the cost of repairing it is about $ 200 , incl . the shipping . add that to the $ 499 i paid for it and this turns out to be one very expensive machine . after several days of back and forth with customer service , i still do n't know what exactly is not working in my machine . apparently , there are 3 items that have failed , one being the thermostat , a washer and something else , that cs was unable to explain . i really liked the machine when it was working , so i gave it some serious thought of shelling for repair , but at the end decided against it - i rather purchase a new rancilio silvia . when i called the cs with me decision and asked them to send the machine back , i was told that on top of the $ 12 shipping there will be a $ 13 handling charge for packaging the machine . i refused to pay that and the rep turned outright nasty . long story short , i finally got them to send the machine back with just a shipping charge , but that was one very unpleasant experience . it is a whole another issue what additional damage they might have done to my machine after the nasty fight i had with them . i really liked the x3 when it was working , and i would love to have it back , but it is just not cost effective at all . what is really confusing to me is that with the low usage my machine had and the maintenance i provided , it has 3 parts needing replacement - if this was a good quality machine , it should have worked a lot longer without any problems .
0	as of today , 3/24 i have not received this product . very disappointed with delivery
1	i 've have looked for a very long time for this lighter quality and easy to wring out washcloths . they are also a nice large size . so many of the thicker washcloths can only be used once or maybe twice because they can not be wrung out properly . the colors of the towels are also beautiful . i 'm buying more for our guest bathroom . thank goodness i searched on amazon . i do n't believe these wonderful martex new splendor items are sold anywhere else
1	great to have crust all around on your cornbread slice ! ! ! you have to spray the pan really , really well with cooking spray then heat it before you put the batter in to allow the cornbread to come out in one piece . i run a little spatula around the edges before i dump the pan . gave one as a gift at christmas and it was a hit ! ! !
1	when i got this i was a little worried it would be too cheapy b/c the materials are light-weight . but , i set to putting it together and the directions were very easy and all the pieces were there and when i got done i was estatic . it was just so easy and looked so good ! i have a very small laundry closet and it fits perfectly next to my dryer and stands about 3 inches below the top of the dryer and is the exact depth of my dryer . unlike other reviewers , i find it rolls very well and is not flimsy or wobbly at all . maybe they overtightened it and stripped the bolts
0	i bought this underwater lighting system with four laser beams and when i installed it one of the beams came defective and did n't lit on ; i did n't matter because they look beautiful underwater ... one week later i noticed that another light went off and two days later the other two shutdown too ; i replaced the beams but they stop working days later . it 's my opinion that this is the worst product you can buy to your aquarium . ( unless you only want to use it for one or two weeks )
1	this is a well built pizza peel . i gave 4 starts instead of 5 because it showed that it was in stock and would ship with 2 day delivery . they actually were out of stock and it came a week after i really needed it .
0	i did a lot of research and chose this juicer based on reputation , motor power and style . i exchanged the first one and am now going to have to exchange/return the second one because it automatically turns off after about 90 seconds , even if nothing is being juiced and the motor just runs ! it is not the electricity as i have used several more powerful appliances in the same outlet
0	my husband brought home this neat black coffee maker , deliberately choosing one without a timer - the less bells and whistles the less can go wrong . . .right ? how can this company not even get the on-off button right ? ? ? it 's so cheap , when you push it , the `` lighted button '' just pushes right in , and does n't turn the coffeemaker off or on . why did n't we keep the box and receipt , so we could return it ? ? $ 20 down the drain do n't buy this
0	these sheets feel like sandpaper ... .they didnt fit my pillowtop either , thankfully , so i had to return the
