1	legendary stars billy barty and diana rigg bring one of the world 's most beloved fairy tales to life in the cannon movie tale , `` snow white . '' starring beautiful and charming sarah patterson ( the company of wolves ) in the title role as the princess who fled her wicked , jealous , and murderous stepmother 's castle as a child , `` snow white '' tells the tale of how the princess is taken in by seven kindly dwarfs living in a cottage in the forest . as the dwarfs go off to dig in their mines each day , snow white cooks and keeps house for years , growing into a sweet and lovely young woman . but , as snow white grows ever more beautiful , the evil queen grows ever more jealous . consulting her magic mirror and book of spells for ways to terminate snow white , the dwarfs must repeatedly undo her vicious magic . it seems the final spell is beyond even the dwarfs abilities to break though . their only hope lies in a young prince who is returning home from a long journey still seeking a great discovery to satisfy the longing in his heart . `` snow white '' sits among the best of the nine wonderful cannon movie tales , which are among the best live-action fairy tale films available to date . sticking more closely to the original stories from the brothers grimm , `` snow white '' and the other cannon tales mix in simple but fun-filled songs with fantastic casts and writing that blends realism and fantasy seamlessly . `` snow white '' features some of the best songs in the lot , and it 's clear that diana rigg really has a ball with her villainous role . it 's so terrific that these childhood favorites many of us remember from the disney channel 's 1980 's and early 90 's glory are finally available on dvd ( most of them at least ) . the dvds include trailers ( not sure if these films ran anywhere theatrically ) , and `` snow white '' is the only one of the four that i currently own that is presented in a letterbox format ( though not much of one ) . the cannon movie tales are mostly family fun , though be warned that some can have their scary moments ( for example , `` red riding hood , '' my favorite , is done as a werewolf story that at times may be a bit frightening ) . the other cannon movie tales , all of which i highly recommend , are : rumpelstiltskin , the emperor 's new clothes , red riding hood , puss in boots , hansel and gretel , beauty and the beast , the frog prince , and sleeping beauty . those last two have not yet been released to dvd , and i have yet to see rumpelstiltskin at any retail stores , though amazon seems to carry it . i wish to get them all , but currently only own my favorites : red riding hood , snow white , puss in boots ( starring christopher walken ! ) , and hansel and gretel . fairy tale fanatics should own all these films , and i also highly recommend my top favorites , the disney animated versions . also , for a scarier version of snow white , pick up the outstanding , `` snow white : a tale of terror , '' starring the beautiful monica keena . more recommendations : shelley duvall 's faerie tale theatre collection ( also best known from the disney channel airings ) , shrek and shrek 2 , the slipper and the rose ( for a live-action cinderella ) , ever after ( another live-action cinderella ) , the adventures of pinocchio ( 1996 ) , peter pan ( 2003 ) , the wizard of oz , return to oz , and rodger 's and hammerstein 's cinderella ( 1965 ) among others !
1	firefly is imaginative exiting and heartfelt . it is simply the best sci-fi ... no scratch that , the best tv i 've scene scince the x files . the acting is very good , the stoyline is compeling and by the last episode i felt like i was part of the crew . i cant believe they pulled it before they even had a chance , does that remind you of anything ? . so here we are stuck with law and order svcipu and the so called reality garb when we could be watching something truly original . what happened to tv that makes us think . dont get me wrong but , saving lives and putting away pervs is all good but , its all the same ! where is capt kirk , where is moulder , where is river ? ? ? : ( science fiction does'nt mean out of this world , firefly really hits home and holds a message for all of us right here in the 21st century . watch the first episode and you 'll be hooked , i was
0	i 'm a fan of ncis , but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd 's area released months behind those in the usa . why is this only available to those in the usa ?
0	this version is eleven minutes shorter than the orginal version based on the information printed on the dvd and listed in the imdb . i saw this film a long time ago and was looking forward to seeing it again , but was amazed at how much they had cut out of the movie . the dvd packaging does not state that it is an edited version nor does the information provided by amazon . they made it a totaly different movie with the editing that was done . i do not recommend this version to anyone . the orginal movie deserves better than this chop job
1	i remember seeing this movie years ago in college and have continued to like it ever since . the movie starts off at the 1988 calgary olympics . doug dorsey ( d.b . sweeny ) is a talented hockey player and kate mosley ( moira kelly ) is a pairs figure skater . both have mishaps during their big moments , doug suffering a career ending injury and kate falling during her performace and failing to meet her own expectations . the movie picks up a few years later with kate having trouble getting a new partner and doug is on the skids unable to fulfill his dream of becoming a star hockey player . added to the mix is kate 's russian couch anton pamchenko ( played by the great roy dotrice ) who decides rick will be kate 's new partner as they struggle to get back to the 1992 olympics . at first glance this is a sports movie about figure skating , but that is not entirely so . the scenes involving the leads on the ice are surprisingly abstract as neither is a professional skater . in truth this is a character driven story and most of the action takes place off the ice . it is absolutely charming to watch the two lead characters go from a dislike of one another , to extreme rivalry and finally ending up in love . the thing that absolutely makes this happen is the chemestry between the leads sweeney and kelly . they are magic together on the screen , so much so that i am surprised they never paired up again for another movie . i highly recommend this light hearted romance to everyone . on a side note about the dvd , the only special feature is the theatrical trailer . there are no deleted scenes . this is where i have a question , because the version of the film on this dvd and that i 've scene on tv in recent years is not the one i remember seeing in college . i distinctly remember the end scene was the medal ceremony . i somewhat like that version because what doug and kate won in that version was so much more . so where is the version with the alternative ending ? ? ?

0	the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his `` harmful if swallowed '' c.d . the c.d . also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long . the one star rating is not based on the content . it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers
1	`` breaking away '' is a true rarity : a feel-good movie that does n't that is n't silly . yes , there are plenty of laughs in it , but they 're the result of great acting and writing , not the cheap , crude one-liners that litter so many of today 's so-called `` comedies . '' and while the movie will tug at your heartstrings , it never spills over into gooey sentimentality or empty pathos . but i also feel sort of sad whenever i watch `` breaking away . '' the small-town downtown where the guys hang out is just a fading memory for most americans . and are there any old swimming holes anymore , like the quarry that the characters visit ? or have they all been paved over , for `` luxury '' mcmansion subdivisions ? shut me up ! just watch `` breaking away '' and enjoy it
1	this is a pretty original 70s horror movie starring two very likeable and attractive stars of the era - katharine ross and sam elliot . it 's just fun , not really all that scary or even too tense . basically sam and katharine end up unwilling guests in a spooky mansion where the guests are dropping off like flies while waiting for an old spooky man to pass away and leave them an inheritance . roger daltry makes an appearance . the deaths are all way over the top , and it 's just fun . dvd is the movie plus a trailer . that 's about it , but the transfer is great considering the age of the movie . great spooky flick for a cold night by the fire .
1	i just read dirk 's `` spolier '' ending to the mothman prophecies and had to say huh ? demonic , fallen angles ? what ? did we watch the same movie ? if all you go by is the movie , that might be the impression you 're left with . but if you 've ever looked into the events that happened around point pleasant , or any of the books on the subject , you 'll see that the mothman was more ufo related than anything . at same time of the mothman sightings the point pleasant area was in a wave of ufo reports , men-in-black , and all sorts of goings-on up in the sky . in fact , mothman played only a very small part in the drama , it was by far predominately ufo related , as keel makes clear . unfortunately , the producers chose to abandon this aspect of the story entirely , and so the happenings at point pleasant lost their entire frame of reference . if you see this movie thinking this was the way things actually happened , you might come to the conclusion of the mothman being evil , demonic , fallen angles , whatever you like . but if you research the incident at all , you 'll see you 're only getting a fraction of the story from the movie . and if , like dirk , you thereby think you know all about what mothman actually was based on just the movie alone , then all your conclusions end up being based simply on a hollywood writer 's imagination and script and nothing more . mothman having anything to do with demons and angels or any religious overtones is as far from the truth as you could possibly be . do n't judge by the movie , read the book
0	this was my first download of this type and also my last . i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare . there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless . the machines keep freezing up . the idea is nice but the technology is n't there yet
0	this movie is a dog , pure and simple . we ended up with two of these are the freebie give aways for the last few dvd players we bought . they ca n't sell it , so they 're giving them away . hide ... fast
1	this movie is so stupid it is funny . i saw it when it first came out and i still have n't forgotten it nor will i ever . this is what the writers of the groove tube , saturday night live , and second city television are all about . watch this film and see a true comedy classic . individual skits like `` catholic high school girls in trouble '' could have been made into a full length movie all to itself . it was an era where one did n't have to be politically correct . this is what comedy is all about . forget the garbage we see today . forget martin lawrence or cedric the entertainer . see kentucky fried movie and you will see what comedy is suppose to be or what it once was . oh , by the way , stephen bishop also has a cameo role in this film and he is n't singing `` on and on ''
1	i do n't recall having seen a film where the actors enjoyed more playing their roles . they seemed to have had a ball
1	the immortal yi soon shin is the best drama i have seen ever . korean , american , does n't matter ! this is better than anything i have ever seen on tv or in the movies . hollywood can not touch this one ! kim myoung min ( yi soon shin ) is outstanding in this ! ( no wonder he won the 2005 kbs best actor award for iyss ) it starts from when he was a child to his adulthood and can be emotional , funny , sad , and can make you angry ! ! the numerous obstacles and prejudices this man had to overcome and then always bounced back with no complaint because of the love of his country is phenomenal ! ! he put his country above all else and kim myoung min did a great job of portraying that ! my whole family , kids and all , watched this with me and loved it ! i can see why yi soon shin is korea 's hero and why other countries teach his methods
1	this is a good alternative to the bombard of hollywood films . it potrays beutifully and naturally the meaning of love and the loneliness of the elderly . i live in one of the asian countries where the famili members still have strong emotional bound to one another . watching this film , i came to realize how lonely one 's life can be when one grows old in the so called modern countries . because things are so modernized , things have got so mechanical , human relation is no exception . this happens to the mother in this film . it is so touchy to see when the mother and the father come to visit her son 's family , everybody is so busy with his/her business , everybody is in a rush and in the end the two of them have to stay in a quiet house with nobody around . their visit is not strong enough to hold people from minding his/her business . her being attracted to the young carpenter is a sign that she actually needs attention and that she is lonely rather than the raw 'love ' between a man and a woman . i recommend this film to those who love to watch a film about love , family and relationship .
1	we have all wondered what would happen if the alien and predator met ... head-to-head . this movie answers that question very well . no cheesiness . we have watched this movie so many times we have lost count , and we still watch it sitting on the edge of our seats or our knees to our chest . great saturday evening movie
1	there are buttered-up popcorn movies that entertain you , score a ticket to `` jurassic park '' and spielberg for that , and there are films with gravitas , that move you , disturb you , drag you to the altar kicking and screaming , to consider circumstances you might not brave yourself.. '' badlands , '' terrence malick 's 1973 directorial debut , an overlooked jewel of a film , forcibly moves you , and takes an unsavory subject , the charles starkweather serial killings ' crime spree , up in the vacated badlands of south dakota , and refines it til you posit , `` how did we get here as a country ? what went wrong ? `` ..and then you appraise the challenges a film-maker overcomes to project the psychopathic wrath of two teenagers ( martin sheen as kit carruthers , sissy spacek as holly sargis ) on a thrill-killing `` honeymoon '' , onto the silver screen and make it empathetic , palatable..why would anyone care in the first place about two low-life , lost highway delinquents , who shoot a parent , assume they can get away consequence-free , and move on with their careless lives like nothing more infractious than cutting an afternoon civics class has occurred ? ..however , `` badlands '' is rooted in unfortunate fact , these inexplicable events happened to a pedestrian populace in north america , and malick lets you tag along in this teenage angst riddled odyssey , deeper and deadlier into an american wasteland..the film is palpable evil genuis , arguably a top ten american film classic , irrespective it was shot by a first time director , with an unknown cast.. '' badlands '' resonates with gritty authenticity , cinematic style , fierce inhumanity , and the most haunting musical score ( erik satie 's gymnopedies 3 ) that underwrites a sissy spacek voice over narration , spoken in a lazy monotone like a detached schoolgirl explaining away her unexcused absence in the principal 's office , when in fact holly ( sissy spacek ) is the fractured other half of the kit carruthers ' killing machine , a bossom buddy in crime..some films are purposefully pure entertainment , escapist faire.. '' badlands '' on the other hand is rare art , belongs in a museum
1	this movie tugs at your heart strings in a completely honest way . the movie does not patronise or make pathetic the boy hero who has to endure . it is the very opposite of saccharine glop . it is a profoundly optimistic and yet realistic movie . the movie is peppered with memorable eccentric and kind characters .
0	i am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company 's software . the vid is encrypted so that you need amazon 's player to view it . blah . you 're better off buying the dvd for $ 20 with all the episodes so at least you can watch the dvd somewhere other than your own computer .
0	this is still to this day one of the most aweful films i ever saw . i took a girl ona date for this movie and wow , what a mistake . the movie has no real plot and just gets worse as you watch it more .
1	once more the irreverent vision of georges bernard shaw , carves in relief with this story about a rich girl who decides to join the salvation army . wendy hiller one of my beloved `` brides '' of the screen makes a delightful and terrific performance in this satire of mistakes where she will discover the other side of the life .
0	the extreme reviews here are very misleading ; people either say it 's the worst film ever made or godard 's best film . do n't believe either camp . if you 're not an expert on godard and/or 1960s avant-garde cinema , i could definitely see a person writing off this movie as `` sheer pretentious crap '' , but that opinion would derive from a mixture of shock and ignorance . on the other hand , those who say this is godard 's finest work must be riding high on acid and marxism themselves . the truth of the matter is that `` weekend '' , like every one of godard 's post-anna karina films , is more a flawed experiment than anything else : on occasion , interesting and thought-provoking , but more often static and didactic to the point of alienating the viewer rather than converting them . i respect godard 's attempt to create a new cinema built on `` ideas '' rather than `` emotion '' , but in my opinion , he went too far in this direction . a piece of art devoid of any emotion is a hollow experience and do n't we have enough of that in our crude , consumerist society ? and as far as experiments go , much of what he was doing in `` weekend '' , he had already done and with vastly better results in `` pierrot le fou '' . that film was a perfect balance between godard the political-scientist and godard the post-modern film-maker . plus , `` pierrot le fou '' benefited by having jean-paul belmondo and anna karina . they brought heart and humor to godard 's abstract explosion of ideas ; a perfect symbiotic relationship between director and actor ( s ) that he never achieved again . `` weekend '' starts off very promising with the sex dialogue and the long tracking shot of the traffic-jam , leading to a car-crash ... but then it descends into a grating mess of dated ideology and too much dead space . you really wish belmondo and karina would pop in and show the cast they do n't have to be mere nails to godard 's hammer .
1	hey , i wo n't pretend to write anything better than `` chris kent '' did below in march of 2003 . just read his excellent review that not only captures the film 's qualities , but also the era in which the film was released
1	derek jarman 's 'sebastiane ' is a momentous painting which is simply brushed on film rather than canvas . this is a master work and should be in any serious film buff 's cabinet . ( i should very much like to see it running continuously upon a smooth stone wall of a monumental pillared vestibule - perhaps like the four seasons in new york . it 's visual beauty should be constantly on view . not one element could be added or deleted . if i may continue the painting analogy , each stroke , whether finished or raw melds this work into a composition which i think is flawless . the men are beautiful , but in a tangible human manner . the settings , whether diocletian 's startling lurid palace or the rough bare terrain of sardinia evoke both pagan and christian motifs flawlessly . good and evil ( and all shades between ) found in both places ; the irony of the world as it is and has always been . the homoerotic nature of the film is vicseral , candid rather than overtly condescending - it might well be set in modrn iraq with 21st century troops . i felt each character 's longings , whether for the god of carnal flesh or that of human love and companionship or a spiritual and other worldly deity . the recognituion that each of these forms of eros may entertwine and meld is genious . it is everyman . it is a scrupulus portrait of the easily duplicit qualities of beauty , deceipt , brutality and even truth . powerful stuff .
0	there are bad movies , and then there are bad movies . `` universal soldier : the return '' is a cosmically bad movie , a movie so poor in every aspect of its execution that one would have to look to `` manos : the hands of fate '' for comparison . the first `` universal soldier '' film was a moderately entertaining shoot 'em up flick starring action stars jean-claude van damme and `` rocky '' refugee dolph lundgren that essentially accomplished what it set out to do : people perished in violent ways , stuff exploded , and van damme and lundgren beat each other into bloody pulps at the end of the film . even the presence of the charming ally walker as van damme 's female sidekick greatly helped the film . the movie garnered enough attention and fans to merit the release of a special edition dvd some time back . it unfortunately also garnered enough attention and fans to merit this unredeemable piece of trash sequel . the second , and one hopes final , installment in a franchise that should never have become a franchise achieves such heights of utter banality and stupidity that i sat in open-mouthed awe watching it . i think i can safely say i am less of a person for having sat through this atrocity . expect to spend a few days in a coma after the credits roll . van damme returns as luc , the reanimated soldier who triumphed over the forces of government sponsored evil in the first film . on this outing he now works for dr. dylan cotner ( xander berkeley ) , a scientist who reconstituted the universal soldier program with the help of his supercomputer s.e.t.h . luc , with his female sidekick maggie ( kiana tom ) , helps design and run training missions for a new batch of super soldiers . the film opens with what the filmmakers hope is a pulse-pounding jaunt up a river , a jaunt filled with explosions , stunts , gunfire , and the briefest glimpse of tom 's incredibly fit form . as the mission grinds to a halt we learn several important things : kiana tom is incredibly hot but ca n't act her way out of a paper bag , luc has a daughter named hillary ( karis paige bryant ) who you just know will get into trouble at some point , and the only soldiers we must pay attention to are romeo ( bill goldberg ) and the one played by michael jai white . frankly , turning off the film immediately after glimpsing tom 's amazing physique is probably a good thing . everything that follows is dull , predictable , and so full of plot holes as to defy description . `` universal soldier : the return '' feels like eighty minutes of dental surgery rather than an action film . sure enough , cotner 's computer goes on the fritz and unleashes the killing power of the universal soldiers . in the resulting conflagration s.e.t.h . implants its consciousness in michael jai white , luc and his loved ones flee from the compound , and the military swoops in to contain the problem . an extraordinarily untalented actress named heidi schanz also pops in as nosy reporter called erin who is interested in exposing the government 's latest shenanigans . predictably , van damme and schanz team up to track down ... er ... well , track down something to defeat the supercomputer . i think they need some code to shut the system down , but in the meantime the film takes them all over the place so that a wisecracking romeo can follow them around while absorbing all the abuse luc can hand out . even throwing in a few scenes set in an adult 's only club ca n't make this turkey fly . it 's dull , folks , and painfully so . by the time the film grinds to its inevitable showdown between luc and s.e.t.h . back at the shattered compound -- with an injured hillary 's life balancing precariously in the background to serve as motivation for an overwhelmed luc ( geez , what a surprise there ! ) -- i knew i just wasted far too much of my life with this car wreck . how bad can it be , you ask ? read on ... plot holes in this film are innumerable , as uncountable as grains of sand on the beach or acne on a teenager 's face . for example , luc explains to erin that he was once a universal soldier just like romeo but cotner `` cured '' him by restoring him to life ; he no longer needs injections or ice or any of the other devices used by the soldiers . what the heck are we doing marveling at this amazing supercomputer when cotner just performed a miracle of biblical implications ? he brought someone back from the dead ! how exactly did he accomplish this feat ? we do n't find out from van damme , who simply smirks his way through a few lines of dialogue that simply boggle the mind with their monumentally idiotic implications . i could go on , but let 's discuss the performances instead -- or the lack thereof . i should say i adore kiana tom ; she 's a drop dead gorgeous babe with a body that could stop the earth 's rotation , but watching her stumble through dialogue is like having your appendix taken out through your mouth . another problem is the lumbering bill goldberg , whose `` funny '' lines are anything but . and the more i think about heidi schanz , the less i think of her . you have to wonder about a film where jean-claude van damme is the best thespian in the cast . you might think a movie this foolhardy should n't contain any bonus features on dvd . you would be wrong . trailers for this film , `` the return , '' `` double team , '' `` desert heat , '' `` knock off , '' `` maximum risk , '' and `` nowhere to run '' showcase the dubious career of jean-claude van damme . a making of feature , a van damme career retrospective ( ha ! ) , a michael jai white feature , and talent bios round out the disc . my advice to those viewers thinking of renting `` universal soldier : the return '' ? run , my friends , run far , far away and do n't look back .
0	i love the avatar and i was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is i 've been trying for the past days and darn it all , it 's not working ! ! ! it 's not as if i 'm downloading it for free . i am willing to pay and yet it just would n't go through ! ! ! i think it 's better to just buy the dvds ... i think it 's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that..
1	i would reccomend this film to any robert johnson fan as well as to anyone just getting into the blues who wants to know where its really at . it includes some great interviews with johnny shines , robert jr lockwood and others who knew robert . its worth it just to hear lockwood play an unrecorded song of r.j. 's ! the parts where keb ' mo ' re-enacts segments from r.j. 's life are well done and effectively illustrate what life would have been like back then for a traveling bluesman . my only criticism would be that there are few extra dvd features , however , that does n't stop me watching this film again and again ! a very informative insight into the life of one of the greatest delta bluesmen

1	eisenstein 's verve has never been questioned , even if it was absorbed by living in 'dark times , ' to reference hannah arendt . this feature is worth anyone 's time as the angles of observation and superb editing defy adequate description
0	ken russell is a gifted director , as his erratic career has proved , but even the great vanessa redgrave ca n't save this one . `` the devils , '' a gaudy , loud attempt to blend period detail with stark surrealism , went painfully awry . grisly images of plague victims , quack cures , peculiar enemas , and oliver reed being burned at the stake were doubtless meant to provide realistic detail -- unfortunately , they are merely stomach-turning . a stocky , wild-eyed oliver reed is sadly lacking in erotic appeal as father grandier , the womanizing priest of a seventeenth-century french town , and most of the other characters are so unlikable that one wishes the entire town had been burned at the stake . gemma jones is one bright spot as grandier 's innocent love interest , and ms. redgrave gives her all to the thankless role of sister jeanne , but the film as a whole is unpalatable and disturbing . not for the faint of heart
1	my brother , henry , always said this was his favorite movie . he loved film noir ... ( although i did n't know what that was at the time ) and , of course , he loved richard widmark in his role . looking back , widmark should have gotten the academy award for best suppporting actor for this ( he was nominated ) but there are many oscar `` should'ves '' . if you like prison/gangster movies , classic film noir , richard widmark , victor mature and , of course , brian dunleavy , you 've got ta see/own this ... if you havn't/do n't already
1	this one has one of those touching endings where you get to see that even booth has a heart ... well , more so than we already know . the ending got me , i got misty over it . enjoy with someone you love
1	this movie shows the real life hell that was andersonville . a prison camp that turned into a death camp . not enough food , water or shelter for all the prisoners sent there . the south was losing the war so they had no provisions or men to assist in the detainment of these captured soldiers . basically letting them rot slowly inside the walls that confinded them . a well acted movie which shows the hell that can come from wa
1	there is no way around it , no matter how it is staged shakespeare will inevitably feel like a stage play . that it is acted by two of britains foremost stage actors of the time , kenneth branagh and emma thompson ( who at this stage were still married ) adds to the feeling . there is some over the top voice projection , but generally this feels light , fun and a pretty glorious rendition of one of shakespeares frothiest plays . much ado about nothing really is just what it says . the premise is that the duke returns from the wars with a half-brother whom dislikes him but has reconciled with him simply to create problems . which he manages to do , embroiling the hapless hero ( the heroine of the story ! ) and her love . it is all based on falsehood and nothing . branagh and thompson play the battling ex-lovers who are reconciled during the course of the movie , but this does n't stay their battling wits and shrewdness . this is one point where their clear diction and stage presence makes a huge difference as each word and inference can be celarly understood . there are wonderful set scenes - the arrival of the duke and his men , and the finish with the dancing through the grounds was gorgeous . the real winner of the movie has to be the house and grounds it is set in - how wonderful ! who would n't want to live in italy after seeing this movie - and a nice way to learn some of shakespeare good fun
0	if you are a christian , this book is n't for you . it is full of blashphemy , concluding that we must `` ... forgive god '' and that we must love god `` ... even if he isnt perfect '' . kusher even has the will to say that `` ... god would not be god ... '' without our love for him . at one point he reduces god to an aminal saying that in the garden of eden , when god said `` ... let us make man in our image '' he was speking to animals and creation . kusher explains that god created the world , and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution . since when was god in need of forgiveness ? isnt it that `` ... god so loved the world '' and it wasnt us that loved god ? i have no words in describing this book . it is full of error , because it does not base it self on the gospel of jesus christ . all this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner , and that it isnt your fault , and that actully you are a good person . why do bad things happen to good people ? wrong question . there are no good people in the world in the first place. `` for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god ... '' the world is in sin . the world does not have good people ! ! only by the grace of god , through faith in jesus christ you are made righteous . i beg you in the name of jesus christ to stay away from this book . it hasnt helped 4 million people , but it lied to them . kusher , please turn from your ways and come to jesus , then will you understand the life question `` why ''
0	i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion . this is the first of two downloads that did n't play . i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok
1	i have loved this movie ro years and was thrilled to find it on amazon ! the story line is cute , the acting is witty , and if you have ever loved a musical , this is for you ! there 's even an interlude with tom and jerry . fun movie
0	i purchsed this video a few years ago and was also very disappointed . i have nothing more to add to the other reviews posted here ; just to agree that the sound was poor and the viewing quite fuzzy . i remember watching not only the first broadcast on nbc but several broadcasts years after that , with different casts . it was and still is my favorite christmas story . i will certainly purchase the schippers cd and hope to see another video or dvd in the future
0	i 'm a huge don cheadle fan , but this film is unworthy of him . [ people ] who claim that it 's a story about racism either do n't understand the film or do n't understand racism . basically , here 's the plot : the character played by mekhi pfeiffer is an unwitting accomplice in a botched armed robbery that leaves three people dying on the floor of a grocery store . rather than summon help for the others , all pfeiffer can think to do is help himself to the money in the cash register . he is caught , and in the ensuing trial the prosecutor calls him an animal because of his depraved indifference to human life . that is supposed to be the psychological turning point in the film , because pfeiffer 's family insists on proving that he 's no animal and can take his punishment -- in this case , death -- with his head held high . yeah , right . guess what ? he is an animal , and if the story had involved all-black or all-white characters , racism would n't be an issue . a more compelling question : if pfeiffer 's family was so concerned with his `` dignity , '' why did n't they teach him moral values in the first place
1	herman wouk 's book `winds of war ' became a bestseller upon its publication , just like its sequel `war and remembrance ' a few years later . these thick books , joining the fictional and historical events during second world war , provided the subject matter for one of the greatest achievements in the history of the tv miniseries . this 6-dvd set covers the first book , with an 18-hour series shot in 1983 . the plot concerns a military family named henry , scattered and absorbed by the winds of war . we follow the patriarch victor `pug henry ( robert mitchum ) , an experienced military officer who in the spring 1939 is appointed to be a military attaché for the usa in berlin . he is accompanied by his dotty and yet quite likable wife rhoda ( polly bergen ) . their children include an oldest son , the flyboy warren ( ben murphy ) , another son byron ( jan-michael vincent ) who is in italy and falls in love with a bit older jewish girl natalie ( ali mcgraw ) , who is the niece of the famous american-jewish writer dr. aaron jastrow ( john houseman ) . the daughter madeleine ( lisa eilbacher ) is the youngest of the three and works as a radio girl . in berlin pugh gets the hint of the atmosphere in the nazi germany of that time ( like the fact jews are treated second-class ) and predicts the upcoming pact between hitler ( günter meisner ) and stalin , both of who he gets to meet during the series . byron and natalie witness the first days of war , being caught in the midst of warsaw , where natalie followed her fiancé , the american diplomat leslie slote ( david dukes ) . the series mixes the lives of the henrys with the historical events of the war ( the occupations of poland and france ; the blitz in london ; the nazi invasion of the soviet union ; the beginnings of the `final solution ' behind the lines of the occupied russian territory ; the japanese attack on pearl harbor to name a few ) . the last episode of this first part of the story ends with the aftermath of pearl harbor : the german offensive is halted on the outskirts of moscow , pug goes to command a battleship and fight in the war , unsure of his feelings for the beautiful daughter of an old friend ( victoria tennant ) , byron fights in the submarine , while in the meantime natalie , who fell in love with byron and bore him a son , is left onboard a ship in naples which is awaiting to live for palestine , since she and her uncle could not find their way out of fascist italy , due to his passport complications . the above is just the basic description of the series and despite of what it may seem , it is not a soap opera , but rather an interesting chronicle of the war and a family influenced by its impact . pug henry gets to meet all the important players of the war ( churchill , hitler , roosevelt , stalin ... ) and in this respect is somewhat similar to young indiana jones . the war itself is shown from these two viewpoints : the henrys and the rest of the fictional characters vs. the historical ones ( hitler and his generals etc . ) there are many things that make this show one of the miniseries highlights of its time . one of them is the excellent casting . robert mitchum brings his renowned charisma for the character of pug and he does it in an excellent way . ali macgraw 's headstrong natalie makes a fine contrast to jan-michael vincent 's younger byron . the historical characters are done more than convincingly . thusly ralph bellamy is the definite fdr ( a role he had an opportunity to play years before in the theatre ) and howard lang makes a believable churchill . one must make a special reference to günter meisner and his portrayal of adolf hitler . as it will be seen in the sequel , the director and producer dan curtis wanted hitler to be overplayed . the reasons remain unknown and one can only guess that he wanted to make it less human in this way . günter meisner , the late german actor who played hitler few times during his career , although a bit too old for the role , managed to keep things under control , so despite the fact his führer is stiffed and not altogether perfect , he manages to give a hint of the evil personage hitler was . this is important to note , since his successor to the role for `war and remembrance ' , the british actor steven berkoff , was awful , playing the character as a total one-dimensional yelling buffoon . the role of hitler is a hard and yet manageable task for an actor who can make a character , as shown by bruno ganz in the recent movie `downfall ' . one of the other appeals of the show is the fact it was shot on location , with attention put to details that make the historical accuracy . most scenes were shot in my hometown zagreb , the capital of croatia , then still part of ex-yugoslavia . the producers managed to use zagreb 's past as one of the former austro-hungarian capitals to recreate berlin , lisbon , warsaw , etc . the scenery and the costumes evoke the era perfectly , thus making the whole thing believable to the viewer . other locations included usa , italy and some more . but the greatest asset is without the doubt the interesting plot which does n't let go for a moment . it is also noticeable that some of the mistakes that were made in the sequel , `war and remembrance ' , ( the narrow scope of the victims of the holocaust being one of them ) are not present here . one can only get a hint of some of the future slips here , for example , the subtle message that all the germans are bad and all americans good . this dvd collection of the series deserves a+ . seven dvds come packed in a nice sleeve . besides the series , there are several interesting extra features : through the interviews with the cast , crew and herman wouk we learn about the process of adaptation , casting , shooting and the problems they all encountered while making this epic peace . some of the footage includes things shot during the work on location in zagreb . for anyone enjoying modern history , an excellent miniseries with the interesting plot or is simply interested in second world war , this is a must-have . highly recommendable
0	shark attack is an interesting tale of deceit and stolen shark footage . the movie features some computer harpooning police men and a crazy fisherman turned taxi driver . the most interesting part is all the shark footage ... the best scene is after the bad guy/hotel owner is eaten , the shark clearly shown with a hook in it 's mouth being pulled towards a boat . this of course has nothing at all to do with the plot . so where did this hook come from ? it was probably i was trying to stab in my eyes to stop the pain of this movie
0	lorna is pretty , and her suitor is devoted . the story holds your attention . for many that is enough . some auspicious beginnings , without depth . so maybe 3-stars for some people . i give 2-stars , if i do not keep it to watch again in later years . i found the romance unfulfilling , and so the movie . romance movies that i liked better are : `` north south '' , `` pride prejudice '' -1940 , 1996 2006 , `` wives and daughters '' , and `` a walk to remember '' . adventure with romance : `` the scarlet pimpernel '' .

0	this is n't funny . it is n't well directed or scripted . perhaps it could have been great , if it had had a decent scriptwriter or director , but it did n't , so it turned out mediocre at best . unfortunately , i believed all the hype on this website and bought a copy of this for my boyfriend and i to watch . i told my boyfriend that according to most of the reviews i 'd read , this was going to be a brilliant , hilarious cult classic . but now that we 've watched it , he and i both know better . we know it 's dreadful , and i can only imagine all the nice things i 'm going to have to do for him to make up for my expecting him to sit through this tedious monstrosity . the only highlight for us was a spirited argument he and i got into halfway through the movie about where we 'd seen one of the actors in the movie before . i 'm pleased to say i won the argument . that was pretty much the only highlight of the movie for me . in my opinion this is not a 'hilarious cult classic ' as others so often describe it . i do n't know how drunk i 'd have to be to agree with that assessment of the movie , or to find it even a little bit funny , but i suspect i would have to get smashed enough that i 'd need a stomach pump afterwards . if you want to see a genuinly hilarious cult sci-fi classic , pick up a copy of flash gordon . that has great actors , great sets , wonderfully campy scripts , brilliant humour , and a soundtrack by queen . furthermore , it has stood the test of time and is still great today , unlike 'the ice pirates ' , which has dated really badly . better yet , get hold of some 'red dwarf ' dvds ... seriously , red dwarf is sci fi humour at its best ! it 's so good , it will spoil you for other sci fi comedies

1	this has got to be the funniest , most warped show on cable today . it 's the ultimate show about nothing - a group of morally-deficient 20-somethings who own an irish pub in philadelphia . they care about nothing but outdoing each other for attention and money . they constantly argue over the dumbest things and come from families more dysfunctional than anyone can imagine . to give you an idea of the show 's themes : there are episodes that revolve around one of the characters trolling for dates at an abortion rally ; another in which the gang tries to outdo each other by pretending to be crippled , just to see who can get the most attention and sympathy from strangers ; and an episode in which the gang charges people to view a `` vision '' of the virgin mary ( actually a water stain in the bar ) . the dialogue is made up of all the things people are thinking but wo n't say . no tender or sappy moments here , these are episodes you would never see on the hallmark channel or lifetime . one of the most unique comedies on tv , and by far one of the best . i look forward to many more new seasons of `` it 's always sunny ... '' and am hopeful it does not lose its edge or pursue milktoast or nonoffensive story lines .
1	first of all i am a huge beatles nut so any movie made by them or about them i love . with that out of the way i can say that this was a very good movie . for those expecting a movie like a hard days night , it is nothing like that . this movie is about john lennon 's friend who was the bass player for the beatles at the begginging of their carrear . it shows how he lost his interst for music and fell in love wiht a german lady . i wont tell u the ending , but this is a true story . all in all i thought this was a great movie . you should defiently buy it

0	my main motivation in seeing this movie was to better understand the reputation of echo park , a little area nestled next to downtown los angeles . i moved to echo park in late 2004 . it 's depressing - the vicious cycle of drugs , dropping-out , and domestic violence . and it 's all here , told through the eyes of latina teenagers . it was easy to see the woman 's hand on the direction of the piece with the important roles that women played . i did n't care for the movie as a whole because it felt sluggish and uneven . i also found myself not caring about any of the characters . so-and-so gets shot , la la loo goes to jail . whatever ! as an aside , though , the evil neighborhood druglord was called ernesto . it turns out my next-door neighbor in real-life is also called ernesto . luckily , it 's just a coincidence
0	the episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes . this one happens to be only 18 minutes . this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle . even though it only cost me $ 2 i still got jipped . let 's hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway . be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them

0	i remember seeing children of the corn right after reading stephen king 's short story version in his classic book , night shift . i was excited because king 's story was such good scary fun . well , i watched the movie and was amazed at how awful it was . while the short story had a building atmosphere of dread and horror , the movie had an atmosphere of pure cheeze . king 's story was short ( like 10-20 pages ) and sweet , w/ sinister children and a mysterious god / monster in the cornfields . the movie has a town full of annoying brats and a cheap beasty that caused much eye-rolling and laughter . the running time is 90 minutes , including about an hour 's worth of padding . cotc would have made an excellent addition to one of king 's anthology movies like creepshow . as it stands , it 's bloated and pretty boring . of course , linda hamilton is in it , which is why i gave it an extra star ...

0	man , i do n't know what the other reviewers of this movie were smoking , but it should be illegal ! this is , first off , a terrible dvd : 4:3 ( full screen ) format , with a dark , muddy picture . worse , the plot is typical , predictable , and poorly written . other than looking for glimpses of teri hatcher 's body , sitting through this fiasco is a total bore . i was also surprised at how bad teri 's acting was in this movie , since i 've seen her do much better in things she was in previous to this . that is probably the fault of the director , erik anjou , a third-rate director ( at best ! ) who has done a total of two movies and one documentary . gee , i wonder why he is n't in more demand ( not ! ) ! i can enjoy `` b '' movies , and bad movies , but this one is just so totally non-involving that it is not even good enough to laugh at . i ca n't imagine that this mess was released on dvd for any reason other than to cash in on teri hatcher 's current popularity , and to suck the cash out of people who are anxious to see a younger ( 29 year-old ) teri hatcher nude . rent this , if you must , but , wow , there is no reason anyone should want to buy a movie this bad
1	i was contemplating on getting the director 's cut of gone in 60 seconds until i looked at the time length . usualy a director 's ct has more added to it , not taken away . believe it or not but the original ; released version of gone in 60 is 118 minutes long where the director 's cut release has a minute less footage . for those that do n't care it 's not a big thing , but for movie goers , a minute off takes alot away ... unless you 're in it for the new extra features

0	this is not the first interview that fra . junge has given . view the sensational 1974 documentary , `` the world at war , ' narrated by lord laurence olivier , and you will see a much younger junge musing over her tenure with hitler . most of the information that she provides in this documentary was given in `` the world at war . '' the 1974 documentary is filled with footage of hitler . having had relatives who were in germany at the time , and personally knowing former german soldiers and officers , i find it difficult to believe that junge did not know of the nazi death camps as both rumors and hard evidence surfaced while they were going on . i believe she knew but because of the fact that she was so taken by hitler , perhaps she did not want to believe the rumors . my mother personally met hitler when she was 15 and was totally mezmerized by his apparent charm and grace . at any rate , `` blind spot '' repeats `` the world at war '' interviews , and is a `` talking head '' that would have been better produced with raw footage with voice-over . the three stars is for effort , minus one star for `` nothing new '' and minus another star for german and not english ( english sub-titles ) . the younger frau spoke good english in 1974 but is lost in `` blind spot .

1	this movie was much better than i expected . with all the nonsense about the `` nc-17 '' rating wooooo , i thought it was gon na be all t and more . not that i do n't like that , but the movie was exactly what siskel ebert were saying at the time : a movie that has a plot and sexuality . not porn , but a truly adult movie . this is a movie that deals with grown up issues regarding sexuality , marriage and fidelity . those who are to immature or whose sense of morality forbids them from whatching a movie about two adults having extramarital and love affairs , definately will be offended and should avoid this movie . if you can watch something like that with an open mind and are interested in such a story line or you are interested in a love story that gets a little complicated and convoluted then this is for you . i am a big fan of uma thurman and that only makes this movie better for me . the story gets a bit complicated as the lovers grow in different directions . this is a very `` artsy '' movie . it deals with comlex love and sex issues . this by the way , was the first nc-17 movie . yes , they made that rating especially for this one , but its not anywhere as hot as showgirls as far as nudity . ( see my review of that one ) i was expecially surprised to find out that this is a true story about famous people . i loved it and i give henry june 5 stars
1	doctor who materialised without his tardis on this , my first timelord download in the amazon unbox , which is much larger on the inside than it appears on the outside . for a very reasonable sum , $ 1.99 , my family and i were able to enjoy the first third doctor adventure after his regeneration , where he encounters the nestene conciousness . the down load took only a few minutes although i had some considerable difficulty installing the microsoft program . thanks to the good people at amazon tech support i was able to obtain an alternative download from the gates empire itself which allowed me to enjoy our rental . a great experience and will not be the last . easy to navigate and fun for all the family . someone should tell the timelords on gallifrey about unbox and perhaps they could get rid of all the old type 40 tardis '
1	jane fonda plays a washed up has been actress in this movie with a very bad drinking problem . she wakes up one morning next to a guy with a knife in his chest and she ca n't remember what happened the night before . then she is on the run when she meets a sympathetic young man played by jeff bridges.unlike hitchcock movies when the violins start to screetch on the soundtrack then you knw something very bad is going to happen . the violins in this movie play pretty loud but nothing happens . i figured out `` whodunnit '' in the first 30 minutes of this film and then spent the next hour trying to figure out if fonda 's hair was a wig or did she get her own hair bleached blonde ? i give this movie 5 stars because i liked the look of the loft where the dead guy lives

1	a film that centers on four friends who made a pact to leave their small town arrive at zero hour and must decide if they will go through with it . the story is simple enough , and not a whole lot happens . but there 's no denying it , this movie is enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing in every way . it 's a treat to see an intelligent movie where the main charachters are teenagers , and that the film does n't have to resort too fart jokes for an audience . not one charachter is stereotyped . they are human , and they 'll probably remind you of people you know . i applaud this kind of a movie , and i wish there would be more of them
0	this is not a good tornado disaster movie by any stretch of the imagination . the worse thing about the film is the horrible , unconvincing special-effects ! the scene where the family in the car trying to outrun the tornado in the town and the mom shrieking `` it 's coming closer ! '' is badly done and also dan starting to fly out the window and his dad attaining super-human strength pulling him back into the vehicle is incredibly stupid and not dramatic in the slightest . i know , however , a guy named mike and 2 robots who would probably have to endure this terrible b-grade movie ( actually f-grade ) if you want a good , entertaining tornado movie that does n't include bad acting , bad `` special '' fx , bad script and dumb actors check out `` twister

1	logan 's run belongs to a class of old school science fiction films which were popular in the early and mid-1970 's , prior to the beginning of the star wars franchise . these films did not rely on non-stop action or dazzling special effects , but rather on thoughtful , intelligent stories , intriguing `` what if ? '' scenarios , and astute social commentary . they included sci fi classics such as soylent green , the omega man , the andromeda strain , westworld , and others . while the shopping mall setting and some of the special effects of logan 's run are pretty cheesy , it is still an interesting film and its themes may be even more relevant in today 's botox era than they were in the 70 's . i have heard they are doing a remake and would like to think it will improve on the original . unfortunately , given the recent history of hollywood , it is more likely that they will drain every last bit of intelligence out of the story , and replace it with more explosions , and perhaps will smith .

1	can watching paint dry be riveting , interesting , and compelling ? can looking at a beautiful woman who is naked for almost three of four hours long movie be not erotic ? is it possible to watch the movie where an artist creates sketch after sketch of his model in preparation for a painting and many scenes run in real time and not become bored but instead be totally absorbed by the painter on the screen and how he was progressing with his work ? jacques rivette 's `` le belle noiseuse '' is certainly not for every taste but i found it immensely rewarding . it is one of very few films where creative process with all its tension , uncertainty , selfishness and self-centering of an artist who once he began working is nearly oblivious not only to his model 's discomfort but to the feelings of the ones close to him have been shown on the screen with such truthful passion , technical excellence , and tremendous acting . michel piccoli as an aging painter edouard frenhofer , once famous and productive , jane birkin ( liz ) - his much younger wife and a former favorite model , and emmanuelle béart as marianne , the young , bright , and intensely intelligent woman whose presence awakened frenhofer from semi-lethargy and made him want to paint again were unforgettable . the film also explores a vital for any artist subject - what is more important , the process of creating a work of art or the result ?
0	actually , since a couple of the yuen brothers did the choreography for this movie , it is n't really ripped off . corey yuen kwai did the action for 'buddha assassinator ' and there is some sleeping style in this movie also , but i will get to the action in a minute . stephen chow plays the king of beggars . once a rich young man and great in kung fu , he gets cheated out of everything he should have had by a government official . he is now forced to become a beggar with his father . the main problem is that the movie just does n't flow together very well . there is just too much beggar talk . the story does n't move along at all except at the start and end . the rest is just mindless talking . this starts out like a kung fu movie , but when chow becomes a beggar , that becomes the main focus of the story . the action is very good when it does happen and i loved the sleeping style . sleeping style has been used in a few older movies and it was nice to finally see it in a newer one , but they could have used it more . the undercranking is way too fast but the fights are still pretty good . 2.5/
0	note : if you do n't want to know how the movie ends , do n't read this . ( i 'm giving you fair warning now , so do n't complain about spoilers later ) . the only reason i 'm mentioning the ending and the `` big secret '' is because i 'd like to spare you from the huge disappointment i experienced when watching this movie . when i first walked into the theatre to see this , i could n't have been more excited ; after months of waiting , i 'd finally get to see the movie whose preview had given me chills every time i saw it ! the movie started out wonderfully : great acting , scenery that could go from gorgeous to terrifying in a matter of seconds , and , at times , almost unbearable suspense ( that shyamalan really knows how to scare ! ) the story takes place in a small town in the 1800 's . at first this town seems like the perfect place to live : the people are friendly , the houses are cozy , and the scenery is beautiful . despite the peaceful setting , however , we get the feeling that something sinister lies beneath the surface of this sweet little community , something that frightens the villagers and keeps them from being completely at ease . every now and then , they glance fearfully at the forest surrounding the village ; nobody ever ventures into it , and a guard is stationed every night to watch over it . pretty soon , we find out why : according to the village elders , there are dangerous , hostile creatures lurking in the woods that will kill anyone who dares enter their domain . these creatures are supposedly unidentified monsters who are so bloodthirsty that the color red is forbidden in the village ( it attracts them ) . for years , the villagers and the monsters have had an understanding : as long as the villagers stay out of the forest , the monsters will not harm them . at one point , however , one of the creatures enters the village at night , leaving the villagers to believe that their uneasy truce may soon come to an end and more of the creatures will attack . while all this is happening , we ( the audience ) still do n't know what the creatures look like and half the suspense comes from wondering what they really are . it was halfway through the movie when all my hopes for the story came crashing to an end : there are no monsters in the woods . when one of the villagers revealed a monster costume and said the shocking words `` it 's all a farce '' , i still could n't believe what i was hearing ; it was all i could do to keep myself from screaming right there in the theatre ! after months of anticipating this film , of expecting a truly scary thriller , and of trying to guess what the monsters really are , there are no monsters ! disappointed does n't even begin to describe it . it got worse , though . the next big surprise was the reason the villagers created the story of the `` monsters '' . the villagers are n't really living in the 1840 's ; they 're living in a modern-day wildlife reserve . supposedly , the leaders of the village used to live like normal modern people , but when tragedy struck their families , they decided the real world was too much for them and moved into a wildlife reserve to start a new ( if extremely delusional ) life . the story of the monsters in the forest was created to terrify their children and keep them from wandering too far and discovering the truth . they even had the village retard dress in a costume and wander around occasionally to scare the other children and make them believe the monsters were real ! when the retarded boy died in the woods ( still wearing the stupid costume ) , the leaders , rather than mourning him , remorselessly saw it as another opportunity to lie to their children by telling them he was killed by one of the creatures . i basically went from sympathizing with the characters to being repulsed by them . what parents could lie to their children and deliberately terrify them like that ? i do n't think i 've ever been this disappointed in a movie before ; not only was it completely misleading , but the plot was pitiful and the adult characters were pathetic ( i 'm sorry , but i have no other word for people who are perfectly happy to live a lie and deliberately frighten and traumatize their children to continue living it ) . many fans of this movie have said that those of us who did n't like it `` do n't get it '' . i assure you , i did get it , and i did n't like it anyway . i 'm no fan of slasher films and i did n't expect this to be one , but i also do n't appreciate false advertising or almost totally unsympathetic characters . the two stars are for the cast and the filming . better luck next time , guys
0	have n't read the book , so ca n't compare , but the relic on film is simply pathetic . yes , it 's a monster movie . the problem is , this movie is no better than most of its genre , and worse than some . the monster looks like a refugee from one of the star wars episodes . the acting and dialogue are terrible . what a yawner !
1	i was about to buy the dvd since i found it in a store near home . i am glad i read the reviews and hope that the poor sound gets fixed for the dvd ... and that the poor reviews get deleted ( the ones about sound quality , that is ) . this is one of my favorite movies and i 'd really like to have a copy . i wish there were far more foreign films in this site . there 's a whole world out there that people do not understand because there is too much of the same around..
1	this is a monumental movie that helped to shape the identity of jamaica after its independence from britain . the character work is very good and the plot gets more and more interesting as the movie goes on . to top it up , the soundtrack on this movie is trully great . the only negative with this particular dvd is that it is slightly below par for a criterion transfer . having seen quite a few criterions , i can say that i was not particularly impressed with the quality on that one . i am sure though that criterion must have done the best they could with whatever `` raw '' material they had available
1	can the book reviewers please pay attention . this is not the book , this is the vhs movie section . i see many book reviews , but not a single movie review . i 'm glad everyone liked the book , but we need to see if the movie is any good here . i am sure it has alot going for it based upon the book , but i have seen some movies do a terrible job . what about this vhs movie ? has anyone actually seen it ? also can someone tell me how to get people to sell it for a reasonable price . used rental copies for $ 22 to 125 is outrageous . one can only hope it comes out on dvd and these scalpers lose money
0	back in the early 90 's , jane march made a big splash internationally with her uninhibited performance in the sexually explicit the lover . granted , the role did n't give her much to work with , but from a physical standpoint she made a big impression on a lot of filmgoers , including me . the movie garnered her a lot of notoriety and she had every opportunity to use that as a spring-board into a legitimate movie career . unfortunately , choosing the unbelievably stupid bruce willis vehicle color of night as her follow-up probably killed any chance at a career that she had . i 've always found erotic thrillers to be quite a dubious genre . most of the ones that i 've seen , while sexually explicit , are n't really erotic . nor are they thrilling in any way . this movie was following on the heals of the tremendous success of basic instinct and almost every studio was chomping at the bit to come out with something similar . as a result we ended up with some terrible films like sliver , jade , body of evidence and this film , color of night . the plot goes something like this . bruce willis is a psychiatrist who has a patient dive out of his office window , going splat on the sidewalk below . he is so traumatized by the incident that he loses the ability to see the color red ( ! ) . he decides to take a break by visiting his psychiatrist friend played by scott bakula and hanging out with scott 's therapy group . he hopes that he might be able to make some sense as to what has happened . scott 's group is a motley crew of screwed up people , from a woman who is nymphomaniac , to a weird androgynous young boy . bruce ends up meeting a beautiful young woman played by the delectable jane march and he quickly falls in love with her . we get treated to explicit scenes of the two of them screwing in the pool , the bedroom , the bathtub and the shower . meanwhile someone murders scott bakula and starts to wreck havoc with bruce . he tries to figure out if it 's someone in scott 's therapy group and on and on and so forth . the movie is really quite laughable due to the fact of how serious bruce willis was apparently taking this movie . virtually everyone else in the movie seems to have their tongue planted in their cheeks with their performances , but bruce seemed to think that this might be an oscar contender . add to the fact that the plot is absolutely atrocious and contrived beyond comprehension , and add way too many red herrings , and the movie quickly becomes a chore to watch . about the only thing this movie really had going for it was the explicit , but decidedly unerotic sex scenes . they really come across as more silly than anything else . the only thing that i enjoyed was getting to see a slightly older jane march in the buff and looking better than ever . what a smoking body ! but , like i mentioned before , she got a lot of the blame along with bruce as to why the movie turned out so terrible and as a result , she has appeared in very few movies since . i still think that if she had been given the proper chance , she could have been a great actress , but people have all but forgotten about her by now . it 's really surprising that this movie did n't kill bruce willis ' career . but i guess if he could survive hudson hawk bonfire of the vanities , he could survive anything . btw , the version i watched was listed as being the `` r-rated director 's cut '' with 17 additional `` steamy '' minutes added back into the film . since i never saw the original cut i could n't tell what might have been added back into this version . there is some fairly explicit sexual content and a shot of full frontal bruce willis nudity in the pool scene but nothing that 's too strong . avoid this movie like it was herpes . color of night is rated r and contains strong sexual content , nudity , graphic violence and strong language .
0	when a movie producer in 1998 foregoes available spectrum of colors and technology opting to feed his audience grain-black , white and jittery gray , the result had better be good . that fraction of members of the technicolor-drunk general viewing audience who will even stipulate to watch such a thing do so at decided perils of time and money , push play alongside mr. benefit-of-a-doubt and strain to see if it works . thus begins the argument of effect and more specifically , that of color . the problem with a black and white movie is that very few movies that resort to that , despite some grand intention , do not work , or , in the alternative , do not work as well . citing two examples - sin city which is near-tolerable acting paired with an absurd choice of black and white , tantamount to robbery , and good night america which is all and about the same . the dilemma with black and white productions is that regardless of how well it comes together , there seems always a thread of an argument in the back of one 's mind that if one must resort to black and white to make one 's point , one might be better served as a charcoal artist . color is the medium of life . from a budgetary perspective , black and white films save money as the 'challenges ' of color , which , in a good feature , can be excessive , are thus eliminated . yet complications arise - for instance - i was n't sure if that was blood or motor oil dripping from that guy 's hand . similarly , the entire cast in sin city could have been wearing hot pink , in shades of course , and we would never know . yet of course this is no excuse to dislike a movie - or is it ? one wonders , however , that , if pi production would have had more money , would they have opted for color ? moot point . it 's done . notwithstanding the obvious that i do n't prefer black and white movies and incidentally do n't know lots of people who do , pi , although a courageous artistic attempt with significant merits ranging from creative camera work , clever symbolism and high-octane guts , seems to lanquish for other reasons . despite pi 's visceral intensity which is delibertaely hot-wired throughout , spinning out scenes that sizzle the nerves , after max 's third or fourth headache it gives up the ghost . as as result , the movie stays earthbound , weighted down by a mediocre revolving-door plotline ( obsessing man chases number grail looking for key to life while beset by outside forces including the recycling feeds of his own troubled mind ) , unremarkable narrative with a gem here and there , failing repetitive effect and thin , uninspiring 2-d support cast , leaving the movie wanting for depth and intelligent character interplay . unresolved imagery and scenes lent the impression that this creative endeavor was a bit out of control and ad-hoc which is no fatal flaw in and of itself but in this case was signficantly detractive . despite a reasonably decent stockpile of cinematic victories the battle was n't won . the themes inspiring pi have excellent potential however this movie trafficked the runway like an antiquated flying machine - airborne one second , belly down the next . as a fine creative exercise , the creators are praised for their effort and bravery - pi is as bodacious as a skunk engaging rush-hour traffic and commands the watcher 's attention until that undefined moment when boredom sets in . contains subterranean theme seedlings which likely served as brain fertilizer for the subsequent more advanced spin-off - `` a beautiful mind ''
1	i purchased this dvd for my very passionate son 's 11th birthday . when he opened it his eyes filled with tears . he has loved gorillas , chimps , and all primates since he was very young . i watched the movie before and was a little concerned about his reaction to digit 's murder . it was as i expected , he cried in my arms . his dream is to grow up and move to africa to help in the survival of this extraordinary species . the movie was given to him for encouragment from ms. fossey with all her beliefs and struggles . we as the human race have a responsibility for all species on earth . this movie will open your eyes and make you realize how vain and selfish humans can be and it also shows that one person can make a difference and is still making a difference years after her death . what strikes me about mrs. weaver is that she was also touched by fossey 's accomplishments and she is an honorary chair person for the dian fossey gorilla international fund . dian fossey wrote this passage in her journal , `` when you realize the value of all life , you dwell less on what is past and concentrate on the preservation of the future . '' i hope this review helps you decide whether to buy the movie or not and brings at least one more person to acknowledge we must all do our part .
0	i used to think this film was okay but it 's really lame . he 's going home only cause he wants a car , shows you how greedy people in america are about christmas . they only care about the material goods they get out of the overrated season
1	i do n't have television , have n't for 11 years . when i learned cbs was allowing free viewing over the internet i checked it out and started watching episodes of csi , csi ny , csi miami , and ncis . i found ncis to be my favorite and this particular show dead and unburied is my favorite so far . i enjoy the light-heartedness of ncis . so i decided to download this episode from amazon unbox . i really wish amazon unbox would allow me to burn shows i 've purchased . as it is they are restricted to viewing on my computer . when unbox expands this service to allow me to burn dvds i will likely purchase many more shows this way . i like selecting individual shows
0	dear film company jackasses , surely you know we already hate you for your greed - why do you add insult to injury by taking fine films like `` the great santini '' and cutting them to full screen ? yet another fine film marred , no doubt , by some big company 's desire to cut corners . burn , hollywood , burn
0	i do n't understand what the people in charge of producing `` the wiz '' as a film , could get by joining the former `` big '' names of diana ross , michael jackson , richard pryor and lena horne in this trashy picture . the music soundtrack is by far , much better than the movie itself . i have lately become a great soul music fan , so i recommend to get the soundtrack album and enjoy it considering it just as a very imaginative soul music work , not keeping in mind that it 's a `` movie soundtrack '' . in such manner you will enjoy it more !
0	a poorly-conceived , poorly put together mess . do n't bother
0	this film was probably made not to entertain the audience , but more to show as much as possible the reality of the terrible agresion on bosnia . but it does so for a small part only , showing the bosniaks and serbs living together peacefuly before the agresion . with the begin of hostilities this film leaves its half-folkloral nature and becomes a pure propaganda movie of serbian nationalists . its attempt to blind the viewer , hoping he never watchs news or read a newspaper , is amaturelike and fails not only through its fake of reality , but also through poor cinematografic form . the dialogs are poor and the actors definitely not worth the theme of the movie . handfull of interesting phrases and few fleshes of situation are by far not enough to save the movie from the abyss . the handling shows several onlogical moments . and as a concept of `` we all suffered and we serbs did not start the war '' it only makes a serious and average informed viewer laughing . this movie does not entertain at all , and shows the events as unrealistic as any b - movie about vietnamwar . and about facts it shows only that there are very unserious and nationalistic directors and producers in serbia . my rating is absolutely thumb down . comparing with , for example , no man 's land this motion picture is failing in everything that makes movies about war a potential time window about occurences in former yugoslavia . instead to jump into the minds of people that participated the war , you can only get an idea of dogma that the director is trying to spread by making this underaverage movie
0	let 's face it . nothing anyone says can sway a particular fragment of this movie 's viewing audience one way or the other . those who love j.lo will declare the greathess of this movie , in a variety of ways . those who hate j.lo will counter their every point in describing how bad it is . and those who love quality film wo n't waste too much time even recognizing that this movie even exists . guilty pleasure , indeed ! one thing you have to admit about j.lo , she 's consistent . she sings bad , acts bad , and is merely eye candy , for thoe who find her appealing . and this movie is full of all of the above , plus awful , cliche ridden , emotionally pleading writing that should be an inspiration to anyone with hollywood writing aspirations , since this movie demonstrates how little talent it takes . at least it 's had it 's short , but sill way too long presence on the premium movie channels , cause for a while this piece of garbage was ubiquitous , just like the lead starlett . maniupulative only begins to describe this drek . but that said , it 's more than enough time wasted on this movie . i merely felt compelled to warn folks . do n't waste your time . it stinks
0	in case you 're wondering , the aforementioned 'suckers ' are anybody who paid to see this movie..and i dont mean just in a theater ... i count myself in because it cost me $ 3.79 at my video store ! looking back , i should have given that money to a homeless person , then went home and stared at a wall while playing suspenseful music ! i would have gotten the same effect of watching this pretentious piece of garbage ! this guy sucks ! ! seriously , his talent level should place him as a writer for the sci-fi channel ... maybe he could write a few decent outer limits or twilight zone episodes ? ? ..but he is in over his head when it comes to big-budget movies ... and where the f did the budget go ? has the the price of 'monster suits ' ( signs anyone ? ) increased to the multimillion dollar range ? my guess is he pocketed half of it and the other half went to the unwitting actors who 's agents suckered them into this sham of a film . if you read the 'quotes n trivia ' on amazon 's link you will find that ( a ) kirsten dunst bailed out on this sinking ship ( good thinking girl ) and ( b ) sigourney weaver had nightmares after she read the script ... obviously she had already committed.. spoiler ... . short summary of the incredibly unfeasible plot : a bunch of people from the city who have had deaths in the family do the logical thing and go live in a wildlife preserve ( although we see no animals in it ) , undetected by authorites , long enough to raise children , whom they traumatize into never leaving the village by dressing in monster suits and other scary tricks . anyone ever seen a scooby-doo episode ? then 1 guy stabs another and they send a blind girl ( with 2 guys we never saw before who wimp out immediately ) to go get medicine through the forbidden forest ( how she is supposed to acquire multiple-stab wound effective medicine is up to her ) ..but the 1st guy she meets gets it for her no problem and helps her back over the wall into the park ! and the cult lives on ... seriously..thats the plot . i 've read that he stole this plot from the book 'running out of time ' ... not to mention the scooby-doo thing , or his camera style which he takes from hitchcock ... this guy is a hack folks
1	i really did like this movie and the different kind of story . it was very imaginative and well acted . the story was very scarey at times and gorey as well . the only problem with the movie is that the director covered up ezra godden 's nude scene with a half shot of his butt in the begining of the movie . other than that , if you would like to see a town that prays to a fish god dagon that wants human sacrafices and the town 's people peeling off the faces of it 's visitors then this movie is for you
0	oh please - whoever has the rights to dub off the original 1972 masterpiece theater tv series of 'cousin bette ' do so and make it available on dvd . this was one of the finest shows ever created for television . truly , it totally eclipses the 1998 movie version and now , 40+ years later , i fear it will soon not be physically possible to render this production to dvd . for the sake of one of the theater ( and humanity 's ) most glorious theatrical efforts , please make the original tv version available ! ( btw - i rate the original item at 5+ stars !
0	curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website . yeah , at the cbs site you have sit through 4 commercials , but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs
0	do n't know about anyone else , but the dvd i purchased had lousy video . the only good shots were of closeups and sometimes it took the cameraman a few seconds to focus on a number of the shots . all of the long distance shots were grainy and not clear and the medium range shots were not good either . i know the concert was indoors , but i 've seen other indoor videos that did not have this problem . did i get a bad dvd or did anyone else have this problem
0	this is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen a must see so bad it is funn
1	i think this movie goes right to the heart of the philosophical question of what art and artists are supposed to be and do : are they merely to present facts/ideas/personalities/images with no comment , no moralizing , no personal ulterior motives ( leaving all those things to the viewer ) , or do they need to state clearly a moral purpose and certain direction ( which the viewer can then accept or reject ) ? martin sheen is kit , a garbageman working in south dakota ; he becomes friends with 15-year-old holly ( sissy spacek ) . when her father tells sheen he does n't want him near his daughter again , sheen kills him . the two run off together , living for a while in the woods like two `` innocents '' of some primitive society . but then they 're discovered by three men and sheen kills them , too . they now head for montana , sheen committing more murders along the way . he is empty inside , nothing fazes him ; he imagines he 's like james dean - misunderstood , alienated . but he does n't have a clue what he should be alienated against , and as far as being misunderstood , he never once gives the least hint there is anything there to understand . we finish watching the movie feeling as empty as sheen . i also felt a little angry at malick 's attempt to con me into thinking there is more to sheen 's vapid character than there really is : he truly is just a non-entity who kills half a score of innocent people . so back to my first paragraph . malick obviously works from the perspective of the first half of my question posed ( a view that became an obsession , i think , with artists , writers , film-makers , etc . beginning in the late 1960s ) ; i tend toward believing the second half . suum cuique
0	i downloaded it and i could n't view the video paste the intro . then i re-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file , but it again it only had sound and not video . this one is a waste of money
0	this title is the bootleg title for a film called the the ratings game . i 'm no sure why amazon is selling this on their web site . the quality of this dvd is terrible , i was suspicious when i got it . the dvd case and the dvd itself look like they were home made . having said all this , knockoff or not this is a bad film with a lot of big names in it . it 's like they were trying to make something campy and failed big time . i expected more of danny devito .
1	grand old movie , well acted , will watch many times agai
0	this film was dreadful . streisand is absolutely unlikeable . to enjoy this film , you would need to buy into the romance between streisand and nolte and i just ca n't see how that is possible . i could n't believe it when i found out how critically acclaimed this film was . along with the english patient , this is one of the worst 'critically acclaimed ' films i have ever had the displeasure of viewing
1	russians and yankees team up to save the world in `` meteor '' , one of the last gasps in the celebrity-disaster movies of the 1970s ' . ( like the `` airport '' movies - you 'd have a bunch of celebs tossed around for no other purpose than to have their headshots printed along a strip at the bottom of the movie poster . ) in `` meteor '' , a huge chunk of an asteroid , blasted out of its benign orbit after by a wayward comet , is now heading towards earth . called `` orpheus '' , the chunk is 5 miles wide and promises to kick off a nuclear winter on arrival . the only hope left are two space-based missile platforms lofted into orbit by nasa and the soviet union - each pointed at targets on earth rather than into space . ( i do n't remember if the platforms , named for hercules and `` peter the great '' actually violated any treaties , but their owners sure seemed keen on keeping them secret . ) the americans learn of the incoming asteroid first , having fatally positioned one of their spacecraft in the asteroid belt at the moment of the comet 's collision . they then learn that hercules is `` light '' -they 'll need extra missiles , and since they do n't have any time to put new ones into space ( and as henry fonda 's president puts it memorably , they ca n't just `` conjure some out of thin air '' ) they 'll have to go to the russians for help . waiting for orpheus to hit , the plot boils down to scenes of the scientists realigning their missile platforms away from earth , and other scenes showing the devastation wrought by smaller `` splinters '' . ( in an interesting move , there are n't any subtitles for the international targets . ) even if you find the special effects lame , the score annoying and the plot thin and holed as if it too was struck by a meteor , `` meteor '' surprisingly gets some good mileage from its stars . sean connery is great in a post-bond role as the civilian designer of hercules - a nasa fixture who resigned when his program was taken over by the military ( `` hercules '' was apparently designed just for this eventuality ) . brian keith is also great as dubov , connery 's russian counterpart . the script has most of the yankees getting along with the russians , so he 's never a foil for connery , but he gets some good scenes going from a genial to an enraged soviet , improbably speaking all his lines in russian . karl malden also rises above what seems like an incredibly unnecessary role as a nasa bureaucrat - he 's neither scientist , engineer or politician , but he keeps connery 's maverick in line . landau , a great actor , plays the thankless role of the cold-war hawk of a general who fears the russians more than shooting stars . the fx are actually pretty good for pre-cgi ( mostly excelling in the space sequences ) . the music seems repetitive , but laurence rosenthal 's score is also evocative of the russians and the oncoming asteroid . much of the movie drags on and many sequences seem redundant . ( did they need all of the `` splinter '' scenes ? the `` avalanche '' sequence is most ludicrous - the world is coming to an end , but there 's no hint on any of the faces of those out skiing the alps in that sequence . ) that said , the plusses and minuses of this flick make it memorable , and the plusses make it worth watching . the script places the control center for hercules underneath the old at bulding in tribeca , and i admit i ca n't pass the place without thinking of this movie
0	this movie was awful . that 's all i can say about it . it killed the book , which happens to be one of my favorites . when i got this movie after reading the book , i excitedly stuck it in my vcr ( yes , vcr -- no affordable dvd players at the time ) , i was expecting so much more than what i received . i know movies have to cut out a lot from the books to fit them into 2-hours , but i 've never before seen a movie cut out the main hero ! now , that 's just ridiculous ! if i were the author , david baldacci , i would be furious that my story had been so badly butchered . clint eastwood had to be the star , so he twisted the whole plot around to make luther whitney the hero , when in the book luther whitney is gunned down half-way though . in the movie , the book 's hero jack graham is totally non-existent . my advice to you if you 're looking to buy a good movie : look someplace else . read the book . *sigh* if only the movie would 've followed the book a little more closely ... it might have been a blockbuster hit . too bad .
0	my favorite show of the trek series but there 's no way i 'd buy another individual program from amazon . it will only play on their downloaded player ... wo n't burn to dvd so ca n't play it on my television . do n't bother buying this ... just go for the trek collection on dvd
0	first of all , i am a joy division and new order fan ; therefore , i tried to like this . really , i did . sadly , this film stinks . the focus is not on the bands themselves , but on the obnoxious character known as tony wilson . what a monster ! either it was the actor 's depiction or he does truly have a horrid personality in real life . maybe i 'm not british , but i did not find 24 hour party people to be very funny . only a few scenes made me grin . the randomness added very little to the overall quality of the film . in addition , the camera work was very jerky . looked like it was done by a novice ( and yes , i 'm one myself , having made two movies ) the only redeeming aspect has to be the scenes with joy division . too bad the members of this band are minor characters . i can only hope that the biopic of ian curtis currently in production will be much , much better
0	after watching this lame , stupid sequel all i can say is `` leave it alone already ! '' god this film sucked . first , after 25 years of trying to escape from brother michael , this is how laurie strode goes out ? ? ? ! ! ! major let down , it should have been more shocking and spectacular . second , while `` 20 years later/halloween 7 '' was made for lifetime , this one seems to have been made for mtv . all dimension films has done for this franchise since taking it over for part 6 , is give it style , no substance whatsoever . the only one of their 3 sequels that was remotely scary was 6 , fully due to bringing back the guy who played michael in 4 ( the last good halloween film ) george wilbur , he 's sorely missed but probably too old for the part now . third , i 'm so sick of rappers and models thinking they can act as is the case in this film with busta rhymes and tyra banks . no talent busta needs to stick to cursing and throwing his hands around to a repetitive beat and tyra needs to stick to walking a catwalk in some designer dress with her mouth shut . they suck . hopefully hollywood feels the same way since i have n't seen them in anything since , thank god . fourth , the story is just another retread with a new gimmick , the internet web cam . poorly executed , no suspense at all in this film . the film was originally suppossed to be released for halloween '01 , but they had to do reshoots to improve the film , unsuccessfully i might add , so it was released in summer '02 . funny , this film was directed by the same guy who directed `` halloween ii '' ( the best sequel ) . even funnier is the fact that they had to do reshoots for that one as well , but john carpenter did them and it did improve the film . his touch is sorely missed here . so , if dreadful acting ( except jaime lee curtis , but she 's only in the first 10 minutes , unfortunately ) , boring , dumb story and dialogue , shockless , routine kill scenes and no scares or suspense ( unless your 10 years old and have never seen a horror film ) if all that 's your cup of tea then by all means watch or buy this waste of time , money effort ( if there was any ) . it 's just another insult to fans of the original . and now , for next halloween ( '07 ) we will get `` halloween : the remake '' directed by none other than the man who brought us the classic ( not ! ! ! ) `` house of 1000 corpses '' , rob zombie ! i 'm also sick of bad singers thinking they can direct . the choice is refective of hollywood nowadays , style over substance , cool and trendy over timeless and great .
0	i dont wont to download it i wont it all on dvd this is waste mone
0	i am bewildered at the praise and adoration that is heaped on this terrible movie . to give an adequate measure of just how bad this movie is , it is only fair to review/describe it on several different levels . first , as mike judge films go , this is the bottom of the barrel . office space was hilarious in its simplicity , where the subtle sarcasm and deadpan rips on pop culture were well-timed , sufficiently developed , and acted out with talent . in idiocracy , the jabs at society and our 'dumbed-down culture ' ( regardless of how appropriate and accurate ) are a dime a dozen , with the vast majority of them falling way short of genuinely entertaining humor . i actually appreciate and am amused by the subject matter and the setting , but beyond that , this movie leave a lot to be desired . secondly , as comedies go in general , this movie stinks . i realize that judge wanted to , on some level , create a commentary on the self-destructive path that our culture is on , and i 'll even admit that the first 15 minutes were very promising . wilson 's character is funny in the same way as livingston 's character in office space ... he is a subtle simpleton who relishes in his blissful ignorance and laziness . however , beginning with the introduction of rudolph 's character , the movie begins its downhill plunge . she is not only not funny , she is downright annoying on screen . she over-acts in most of her scenes , leading most viewers in suspense as to when she 'll go away . her character , amongst countless others ( including dax shepard at his quasi-retarded worst and terry crews in a role that would make even the most avid randy savage fan cringe with his over-the-top-yet-still-not-believable machismo ) , is one of the weakest supporting characters i have ever seen . i found myself silently condemning the casting director throughout this movie ... not to mention counting down until it was over . i think that this is where judge 's latest offering falls [ way ] short : in office space , livingston is surrounded by an amalgam of genuine ( albeit nerdy ) characters who not only are tolerable , but in most scenes are actually as integral to the humor as the protagonist . wilson is talented , but even his drawling wit and everyman charm wear thin in this stinker . in addition , his agent should be shot for signing him onto this one without a better supporting cast . verdict : do n't waste your time . re-watch office space if you 're looking for some judge humor that actually elicits laughs
1	i absolutely love atlantis . from ronon dex , to sheppard , and to all the faces . i 'd cry if atlantis was cancelled . seriously though , steve should have never have died , he should also have been put in command of sg1 . can you imagine that ... '' why steve , welcome to earth ... you 're welcome to live out your life , if you only feed in self defense on enemies ... 'kay ? oh , you 're also in charge of sg1 . : p '' but seriously , the wraith make this show so awesome . from steve to bob to edward , to gordon and alexander , to michael and eric ( by far james 's best performance yet ) . the wraith make this show what it is . but one thing ? ? ? why do n't we have before i sleep ? seriously , you have no idea how irked i am at that , since i began watching in s.2.12 . anyways , i think atlantis totally pwns sg1
1	this is an hbo remake of the original 50 's 50 footer . naturally there had to be some adjustments for the new era . however it still captures the thrills and chills . you may also marvel at the spandex clothing that stretches for ever ( rats . ) nancy ( the little woman ) does not have quite the devoted husband . here life is not quite ideal . soon a chance encounter with aliens ( the space type ) leaves her feeling bigger about the situation . 50 foot bigger . now it is nancy 's turn for a little revenge . the ending is a little unnerving . be sure to see daryl in just as serious of a role in `` high spirits '' ( 1998 )
0	i saw this movie about two weeks ago and i ca n't believe how disappointed i am for this . i was expecting fireworks ; instead i got a truckload of bad karma on my head . not only that but it maybe the most over-the-top film i ever saw and it will be on my list of the worst movies i ever saw . to begin with half of the characters die in this film and i was like 'what is the meaning ? ' then there 's the film 's signature moment in which sinatra wakes up from his nightmare and they do it in such a matter that they put his face right at the camera . again i said to myself , 'what 's the point ? ' and then there 's the chilling climax which would be totally ripped off a year later by the kennedy assassination-from the scoped rifle right down to james gregory 's character getting shot in the head . in one of the documentries to this dvd director william fredkin says that there is no doubt this movie caused lee harvey oswald to kill president kennedy because 'oswald realized that he was raymond shaw . ' if he 's right that raises the question : did he do it by his beliefs or did someone push him over ? then fredkin ends his obseravation by saying that the release of `` the manchurian candidate '' and the death of president kennedy are the two events that made the 1960 's what it is and why people today ( including me ) are still obessed with that decade . in conclusion , i think this was a big disappoinment . and this movie is on the list of afi 's 100 greatest films ? please .
0	filmed in 1933 , this movie is in black and white , and might be considered dull and slow-moving by today 's standards . an accurate chronology of the six wives of henry viii , the characters of the wives are rather undeveloped , and the movie does not delve very deeply into the important religious and political questions around which the marriages centered . a good introduction for those who are unfamiliar with the basic story , but the serious scholar will want to conduct further research
0	i picked up the book at a yardsale without knowing much about it , and absolutely loved it ! it is so smart , funny , and heartbreaking , without ever being sappy . so , naturally , i was curious about the movie too . i figured that because ephron had written the screenplay too , not much could go wrong . and while the story line followed the book more or less , the movie turned out terrible . i could not have been more disappointed ! ! first of all , jack nicholson is completely miscast , because he essentially plays himself ( as usual ) , not the *interesting* guy that mark is supposed to be . he is the opposite of charming , funny , tender , lovable , i.e . somebody that the character of the wife ( rachel ) would fall so deeply in love with and trust so completely . you suspect all along that he is a cad ; therefore , rachel 's utter shock at his betrayal does n't make sense . besides , he is too old for the role ! meryl streep is annoyingly twitchy , but much better in her role as rachel . still , she ca n't carry the movie alone , and her love scenes with nicholson are flat ; there is no spark there . i wonder how happy ephron was with the movie adaptation of her novel , and whether she really did write all the scenes . the wedding scene , where rachel has doubts about marying mark and spends what feels like 5 hours in a room alone agonizing , while the wedding guests wait , is out of place , not to mention boring , not to mention heavy handed . a total dud
0	after two hours of watching it , i still do n't know what it was about . yes , the scenery is fantastic , but a national geographic film would have done more . i applaud the acting of milla jovovich , and nastassja kinski . but , the kudos reviewers have given to peter mullen would have been better deserved if this were a silent movie . i hardly heard anything he said and there are no english subtitles offered on the dvd . as for wes bentley , that 's acting ? he kept the same expression when he was having sex as when he was having a gun pointed at him , or a co-worker being blown to `` kingdom come '' ( that 's a pun based on the movie ) . he makes clint eastwood look like laurence olivier . the film is supposedly based on a thomas hardy book , but very loosely based , and the scriptwriters should have at least used cliff notes to have learned more about the story and the character development . they obviously fell asleep after the first couple of chapters and made up the rest .
1	dino made a number of westerns , everything from the comic western pardners with jerry lewis , to a whodunit western , five card stud with robert mitchum , to playing an alcoholic lawman in rio bravo . but martin had a field day playing the villain in rough night in jericho , a hard-bitten , violent movie . martin plays jason flood , an ex-lawman who has taken over the town of jericho . george peppard and john mcintire plays former lawmen as well , who have been contracted to provide a stage to jean simmons , who flood is trying to force into going into business with him . flood is also an ex of simmons , which makes him even more determined not to let peppard and mcintyre help her out . things get increasingly violent until the final showdown , where the blood flows freely . everyone is good in this film , fro mthe three leads to mcintire , who was always superb , particularly in westerns , as well as the great slim pickens as one of flood 's henchmen . rough night in jericho is overlooked , but it 's very entertaining
0	mortal kombat : annihilation is one of those films that is so bad that it actually hurts to watch it . from the nearly complete recast of almost all of the characters ( odd , considering that in interviews after the first movie , all of them said they 'd want/ be willing to come back for a sequel ) , to the horrible ( even by 1997 standards ) cg effects , to the cliched fight scenes ( gee ... two women in a mud pit . i bet it took them all night to come up with that one ) , virtually everything that could have gone wrong with this movie did go wrong with this movie . loosely based on the story of the mortal kombat 3 video game ( and set immediately after the first movie , which , while not great , looks like citizen kane compared to this stinkburger ) , the movie set about the lofty goal of depicting shao khan ( played by brian thompson , the alien bounty hunter from the x-files ) and his army ( shown in most scenes as a small band of extras . oooh ... scary . ) as they attempt to take over earth by merging it with the alternate dimension known as outworld . this merging of realms will result in the destruction of humanity . with only a week to do anything about it , lord raiden ( played by james remar , replacing the , and i ca n't believe i 'm saying this , much better christopher lambert in the role ) once again enlists the help of liu kang ( robin shou ) , sonia blade ( sandra hess ) , and princess kitana ( talisa soto ) , along with help from a select few other characters from the video games ' crowded lineup , to prevent this from happening . the story in and of itself is not necessarily bad . however , given the film 's obviously low budget the weak screenplay , the loss of most of the excellent cast from the first film , and most jarringly , direction even more inept than that of paul w.s . anderson , it quickly becomes clear that they set their sights too high , only to have practically everything come crashing down . the only saving grace of this film is its killer soundtrack , featuring an updated version of the theme created for the first movie , as well as music by kmfdm , megadeth , rammstein , juno reactor , and others . if ever you 're looking to punish yourself for something , then by all means watch this movie . however , if you actually like yourself and want to remain on good terms with yourself , you will avoid this movie like the plague . believe me , you 'll thank yourself later .
0	we have a lawman who for no explained reason starts to investigate the cause of death of a man with 500,000 on him and it all goes down hill from there . there is no rhyme or reason to the story . i gave it two stars because the landscape is great
1	... then this would be a really serious detective . as it 's executed now , it 's a superbly relaxed copper-gets-the-villain with serious undertones . cool
1	easily one of the funniest movies ever made . its incredible today to realize that irene dunne never won an oscar , and this year is the most galling of all , as she lost to the ridiculous luise rainer in `` the good earth '' ; and even more galling to realize that cary grant was not even nominated ( after all , its only a comedy , right ? ) but this is a movie that will never age : it makes me laugh as much today as when i first saw it on television thirty years back , and if id been alive to see it in a theater 70 years ago , the response would be the same . dunne and grant excel as a divorcing couple who sabotage each others new relationships , and randolph scott is a miracle as dunnes new fiancee ( `` not oklahoma city itself ? ! '' ) . but it is irene dunne who is the star here , and until such time as `` theodora goes wild '' and `` show boat '' are finally released on dvd , this is the best of her 30s roles .
0	i imagine this movie might be funny if you 're really into dog shows . i 'm not , so i could n't tell you . mediocre at best . `` this is spinal tap '' was better
1	i really love bones . it has everything : suspense , drama , humor , pretty people , fun storylines . i have yet to miss an episode , and even into season 2 this is probably my favorite . it adds depth to all of the characters . also , the winter holidays are my favorite time of year . i like holidays that are about what is good in the world . bones is about people standing for the good in humanity even though they explore the very worst every day . i cry through half this episode , but in a completely good way . buy , watch it , love it . but watch it with a friend if you do n't want to cry alone . so moving , great performances by the whole cast . emily deschanel was powerful in this one , she brings real vulnerability to brennan here . david boreanaz , as always the perfect sympathetic hero , loveably old-fashioned . cute , funny moments . touching , poignant moments . this really is the best of what is great about bones
1	on a june evening in 1968 i was awakened by my dad , a marine raider and one of the chosen few , at ten o'clock pm , that 's 2200 , to watch the di ... five hours before i was to report to the armed forces induction center , oakland , calif . i wo n't ever forget that movie session with my dad , and as one other person commented , ya never forget your dis , mine were ssgt gonzales , ssgt rogers , and cpl sexton . great movie , jack webb is still the di , sorry r. lee , got ta go with tradition here ! sure would like to see this on dvd , but for now i 'll settle for the vhs ... i bought two copies , one for me and one for a friend ! semper fidelis to all the brothers and sisters ! pau
1	flesh and bone is an evocative , haunting and rewarding study of a drifting man ( played with understated , heartbreaking perfection by dennis quaid ) who encounters a lost soul ( meg ryan , outstanding ) leaving a violent marriage and begins a tender relationship until a dark figure from his past shows up . plotted an as slow burning thriller , this is really more of a complex and intriguing character study of guilt , father-son ties , violent crime and doomed love . flesh and bone is a bleak but supremely well crafted film that reaches a truly sad ( though inevitable ) conclusion . the final moment between our two main characters is incredibly moving ( in a very unsentimental sort of way ) and a scene that i will never forget . i didnt mind the major plot twist as its no more unbelievable that a dozen of hollywood 's most praised suspense thrillers . the spare , atmospheric photography ( set in a desolate , bleak texas ) is exceptional and thomas newman 's suberb score will get under your skin . for those who wont something altogether deeper , affecting and more emotionally satisfying with their thrillers ( or love stories ) , flesh and bone should be ripe for rediscovery .
1	what can i say if you like clint eastwood your going to like this movie . i have not seen this movie since it played at my local drive-in ! what memories
0	i reviewed the subtle subversiveness of the sinatra version in an earlier issue . how does the update stand up ? well , once they moved the setting to iraq , cleaned up the muddy surrealism , sobered up the star , and played it straight , there was absolutely no subtlety whatsoever to the political message . like dropping a bowling ball on a birthday cake . or chinese cinema . `` we will tell you what to think . '' the locals might mistake it for a documentary . i quit watching after 30 minutes . you just ca n't carry an entire movie with a `` fake war hero via hypnosis '' plot . no movie should hinge on a single plot point , and if it does , please do n't make it a boring one . no disrespect to denzel washington intended . he played frank sinatra so well that co-producer tina sinatra probably got goosebumps . and what a waste of meryl streep . she did a great job and it did n't matter . but hey , one of the beauties of watching dvds in china is that i do n't blow three hours ' pay on each movie . as a brief aside , show one flew over the cuckoo 's nest to 155 chinese students . this film refuses to tell them what to think , and that confuses the hell out of them . then they ask you , mr . teacher person , to explain the film 's message . um , it 's about your school , but i 'm not saying that .
1	i grew up in australia with these rankin/bass christmas cartoons and i missed them when they were no longer shown . i can only say that the dvd 's are fantastic and the cartoons are exactly as i remember them .
0	this movie is so bad , it barely deserves mention . however , i am a big dl fan , and i am writing this in the hope that dolph will not abandon his fans -- -he may be making movies like this just for the $ $ , but , i believe , he is also doing irreparable damage to his career
1	it is truly a pity that the western has died off . they are rare and far between these days . a few years back tom selleck and sam elliot made a few together and separate . they are all worth seeing . this one has tom playing cable , a confederate soldier who has left the war early because he knows it is over and the south has lost . it just has n't been declared yet . his family and friends thought him to be dead , and the reunion seems a bit shaky . his wife played by suzy amis , is a tough as nails no nonsense frontier woman that knows guns well from her fathers gunsmithing business . eventually she works things out with her husband cable and it is a good thing he has her to back him since she is great with a gun . even though cable believes the war is over he finds sympathizers trying to enlist his aid in the confederate cause but he shuns them . when he is accused of murdering a retired union officer he must track down the real murderer and bring him to justice . the production values are excellent and the acting , directing , sets , and music are all top drawer . good dvd quality but no extras . if you enjoy westerns you should find it very entertaining . if you like it be sure to see `` crossfire trail '' and `` conagher ''
0	oh the humanity ! ... first , the obvious : tara reid as cybill ? i do n't know who in the film industry owed whom a favor , but it is a mystery how that happened . secondly , dominique swain just did n't act like the andrea marr of the book . it seemed like dominique swain did n't even read the book before she played andrea . i also happen to think that she is a very poor/mediocre actress all around , but that 's another topic . the movie did n't have any similarities with the `` feeling '' of the book , even though the plot was ( roughly ) similar . portia derossi as carla ? ummmm ... . maybe ? selma blair as darcy sort of worked . the only character i felt was well-cast was todd sparrow . anyhow , i re-read the book a few more times since seeing the movie , to try to recapture the feel of the book ( and erase the memory of the movie )
0	if you got elvis presley and dodie marshall and put them in the same film you will have easy come easy go , an elvis presley that people who like boats or sailing or both will love . but anybody that hates boats or sailing and is an elvis presley fan will be un-happy . and elvis ' leading lady in this film is dodie marshall which i guess is a re-make of a film with the same name came out in 1947 . and this is one of final films that elvis sings the same song with somebody else , and the song is yoga is as yoga goes . he sings that with elsa lanchester who plays a not very nice yoga teacher . if you are an elvis presley fan , then buy or rent jailhouse rock on video or dvd
0	curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website . yeah , at the cbs site you have sit through 4 commercials , but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs
1	the best.not exacley a shark movie not very many people die.lots of action and your in suspense not cause of the shark . cause of the people you dont now who to trust.good movie see it see if youl like it

1	in the sequel to `` john carpenter 's vampires '' , derek bliss ( jon bon jovi , who takes james woods place ) is a professional vampire killer who has been assigned to terminate the vampire queen in mexico uma ( arly jover ) . along the way he assembles what terns out to be the most montley of crews in vampire hunting history . zoey ( natasha wagner ) , a girl who is strung out on vamp blood . a priest who has n't quiet taken his vows yet . and last but not least a black redneck mercenaery . guys , this is what it is . actually it is n't too bad . bon jovi is not the world 's greatest thespian ( his antics in concert are amazing though ) . do n't quit your day job , jon . but he still has a certain charm thaat gets you through the film 's rough spots . arly jover was cast because she looks good naked , period . this is a low budget film , but vet horror director tommy lee wallace knows how to make it streach and give us a good time . just do n't be looking for high atr
0	i like japanese films , and really wanted to like this one . however i must say there are a lot of confusing parts to the plot . now i have read this is going to be part of a trilogy one day . if that is true i might give it a higher rating . as of now however , there are just a lot of things that do n't make sense
0	for that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of his/her dirty secrets covered up . i feel that it 's the most insulting film to be released . it hides the fact that we as citizens , and our government do n't really care about who we stick in office . if the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up . i ca n't fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time , and believe me i do n't feel it 's right to air it all over the news either . i feel that it comes down to the man , and if he does have the values his/her party believes in then he will do the honorable thing , and own up to his/her mistake . this movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it 's alright to cover things up , and there are no absolutes , or rights or wrongs . wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who 's rich ? do we wait until then to change the moral ? that 's pathetic , and so is this movie
1	oh yeah ! this is the film which set the standard for the women-in-prison genre . the big doll house has everything you could possibly need if you are wip junkie : cat fights ( one even takes place in the mud ) , group showers , sadistic guards , scantically clothed gun toting babes , lesbianism , torture , and pam grier . oh yeah !
0	so this movie is made of 2 stories . the first one is quick and involves takeshi kaneshiro and brigitte lin . both have their stories and i actually found kaneshiro more interesting . so this thing ends and the movie should have also . it should have been a 30 minute movie . so for the next hour or so we get to watch tony leung chiu wai sit around his apartment in his nothing but a white tank top and his briefs . wow , what a movie . the only positive to the second story is the girl who listens to the same song all day . she was fun to watch but i still wish i would n't have seen this dumb movie .
0	my favorite show of the trek series but there 's no way i 'd buy another individual program from amazon . it will only play on their downloaded player ... wo n't burn to dvd so ca n't play it on my television . do n't bother buying this ... just go for the trek collection on dvd
1	while i recently called `` ballad of cable hogue '' my favorite sam peckinpah movie , this outre take on revenge is undoubtedly his best , and imho one of the best of the 1970s . for those who havent seen it , the setup is the daughter of ( presumably ) mexican land tycoon has been impregnated by one alfredo garcia ; the angry dad offers a huge reward to whomever delivers to him the severed head of alfredo , and down on his luck bum warren oates ( think a seedier version of bogart in `` sierra madre '' ) is hired by a pair of `` entrepeneurs '' ( gig young and robert webber ) to do the dirty work . the irony : alfredo is already dead in a car accident . and that is the setup for where the movie really takes off in a spin of revenge , justice , betrayals , love , -- all against the sight and smell of the deteriorating severed head rotting in 100 degree plus heat . oates was always an underappreciated actor , but here he gives his best performance , matched by mexican actress isela vega as his doomed girlfriend . not a movie you want to watch frequently , but it is a masterpiece .
1	i wo n't lie . this movie sucks . however , it is so cheesy and lame that it will make you wet your pants . i do n't care what people say , but i like the no-name actors and the wanna-be power ranger ninjas . it is a great movie because it is the worst movie ever . also , i must add that the action was utterly stupid and the acting was absolutely pathetic . : ) great movie , though . yes , i will agree , the plot sucks . however , there is no plot , therefor the movie rocks . buy it now and own the best movie ever for two bucks used and new . it 's the corniest and cheesiest movie ever ! :
0	i wish i had read the other reviews first . though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch , the episode cuts off after 22 minutes . obviously , i already know the ending of `` the black death '' , but i still wanted to see the full show
1	i wanted it for my collection , however you can sift through all the youtube stuff and end up with the same video for free if you want to do the work
1	i have loved this movie since seeing it upon its ' initial theatrical release . many sleepless nights ( and views ) later , i was able to begin to make some sense out what jacob singer was going through . as listed in the other reviews , this is not a movie for the 'casual ' film-watcher , as it requires the viewers ' full attention . the imagery is amazingly suggestive without being overt , and is one of my favorite elements -- -what you 'think ' you see may sometimes be more psychologically terrifying than what you actually see ... but , this is not a horror film in the strictest sense , although it is horrifying , considering what jacob singer experiences . i am amazed , even here in 2007 how well this movie holds up in story , cinematography , acting , and general flow . it works itself into your brain and sets off a bomb inside , making you `` live '' through the mind of the protagonist , feeling his `` ascension '' ... if you 've not seen this movie , then you 've missed a real treat , but prepare yourself -- -do n't watch it until you 're mentally prepared , and certainly do n't watch it if you 're depressed already -- -this ai n't no `` feel good '' , `` happy times '' movie ... and , if you 've not seen it in several years , then watch it again and take your own climb ... or descent ? ? ?
0	this movie was awfull . supertroopers was awsome and beerfest was even better , so i suppose they can be forgiven for this cinematic abortion
1	i have owned the video for several years and just purchased the dvd . hannah and her sisters far exceeds anne hall as my favorite allen picture . such a joy . and the dvd is wonderful
1	i seen it a few months back then , to my dismay it was on again the same time as raw , but instead i recorded it anyways . it does a very good job of creating a nightmare orwellian future , without making the people seem too paranoid for the most part . the scenes of the president talking on tv were very powerful . it strongly reminded one of a `` big brother lite . '' yes there is violence and a love story and rebels risking their lives for a better future . some favorite moments : 1 . the girls running out of the clinic 2 . the guard and dog patrolling the quarantine 3 . the rebel leader screaming for guards there was a negative present ( which is punishable by getting shot on the premises ) 4 . the extremely moving ending and the new rebel leader awesome flick you do n't wan na miss , trust me .
0	dear film company jackasses , surely you know we already hate you for your greed - why do you add insult to injury by taking fine films like `` the great santini '' and cutting them to full screen ? yet another fine film marred , no doubt , by some big company 's desire to cut corners . burn , hollywood , burn

1	dvd newcomer `` fort apache '' ( 1948 ) looks great , with minimal wear on its crisp black-and-white images ( from original nitrate elements ) and bugle-brisk audio . the film , ironically , finds henry fonda playing the maddeningly hawkish cavalry commander against john wayne 's humanistic officer willing to risk all for peace and justice . the ( single ) dvd has no documentary on the exciting and heartfelt film , a shame . it does include a 15-minute piece on monument valley , covering ford 's significant and seemingly beneficial role in the indian reservation 's history . the navajo , paid good wages for their appearances , called him `` giant soldier . '' `` i 've kissed more babies than a politician , '' ford said . `` part of his vision of the world was that we 're all very small in the scheme of things , '' film historian joseph mcbride says . `` i think ( monument valley ) gives a dimension of moral seriousness to his work that was intensified as he went along .

1	dexter gordon is dale turner , an ex-patriot jazz musician living in paris and playing nightly at the blue note . ( his character is based loosely on lester young and bud powell , but mainly it is all dexter . ) a young frenchman ( francois cluzet ) idolizes him and later befriends him . dex has problems , mainly booze , and between blowing gigs seems most concerned about how to get something to drink . the cliche of the self-tortured jazz musician who 's got to find something new to say on his horn every night is , of course , the main focus of the film . ( that this is the only way to greatness for a jazzman is the great myth for the artform . but it sells . ) dex gets homesick for new york , returns , falls into his old habits , misses the flight back to paris , and soon dies . the movie is overly long , but gordon is mesmerizing . dexter speaks slowly , as if from behind a veil ( gordon was ill at the time and living in obscurity in mexico when he agreed to do the movie ) ; he had much input on the film , creating his own dialogue and insuring accuracy . the picture has faults , to be sure , but it 's a mighty achievement nonetheless . the music , of which there is plenty , is , of course , top-notch

1	doctor who materialised without his tardis on this , my first timelord download in the amazon unbox , which is much larger on the inside than it appears on the outside . for a very reasonable sum , $ 1.99 , my family and i were able to enjoy the first third doctor adventure after his regeneration , where he encounters the nestene conciousness . the down load took only a few minutes although i had some considerable difficulty installing the microsoft program . thanks to the good people at amazon tech support i was able to obtain an alternative download from the gates empire itself which allowed me to enjoy our rental . a great experience and will not be the last . easy to navigate and fun for all the family . someone should tell the timelords on gallifrey about unbox and perhaps they could get rid of all the old type 40 tardis '
1	prior to watching this , i expected something on par with `` striptease '' or `` showgirls , '' which are films about stripping that also attempt to legitimize their titillation by tossing in dramatic subplots . even with earnest intentions , films of this sort usually end up being clichéd and disappointing . adding to my trepidation was the fact i had never heard of this film , which was released in 2000 , prior to 2006 . i finally took a chance on it and gladly admit that it really drew me in and convinced me to care about the characters . like most people , these women only want to find love and something real in life , yet have lost their centers . indeed , it is the actresses ' portrayals of these characters that make each disappointment and set-back so painful to watch . sandra oh really moved me with her performance as jasmine , a would-be poet who sabotages her own happiness because she has come to believe she can not trust anyone , including herself . her performance as a sensitive , intelligent person is the most tragic among these lives because she lacks the confidence to escape her current situation , even though she easily could . as angel , darryl hannah is wonderful as a helplessly dim and hopelessly optimistic dreamer . ( she also looks unbelievably fit ! ) jennifer tilly is also very good as the out of control jo , a woman who tries desperately to win in a man 's world , but comes to realize the playing field is not level . charlotte ayanna is remarkable as jessie , an eager to please naïf , who has not yet had her spirit crushed by the weight of the world . come to think of it , it does all sound very clichéd and there really is n't much of a plot to tie it all together , just several subplots . nonetheless , the acting is exceptional , made all the more impressive by the fact much of it is improvised . ( and yes , the ladies here all smoke , which would ostensibly account for their trim appearances ) i enjoyed the entire two hours and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good character study without the hindrance of a plot . the dvd is quite decent , with a very good transfer , optional subtitles and some alternate scenes . this is a bargain for the price .
1	it 's a great human being , mr. elvis aaron presley , and his talent is real in this funny movi
1	this movie is a classic . we owned it on vhs and the tape finally fell apart , so i ordered it for our family for christmas . good for all ages , nice night of entertainment for all of us
1	the characters are likable , there is some decent progression and growth seen over the course of the film , but only about half of the scenes are necessary . it seems as if they just wanted to give gene wilder a few more chances to be quirky . gene is a funny guy , there is no doubt about that , but enough is enough ! the film is family friendly , except for a few instances of harsh language and violence , but it is really nothing compared to the sorts of things that get into theaters these days . it is worth a look , but only if you 're willing to deal with some pretty decent stretches of time when there is not a lot of progression in the story
0	i downloaded it and i could n't view the video paste the intro . then i re-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file , but it again it only had sound and not video . this one is a waste of money
0	i loved the book and made the mistake of buying the movie without watching it first . this movie is boring and did no justice to the book
0	this has got to be the worst film i 've ever seen . its not sad . its not funny , jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage . i do n't have any sympathy toward nick in this movie , because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him . the actor is the worst of all . i cant tell if he 's sad in some seens , or angry or jest retarded . i 've seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks , i guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present . it probably worked better back in 96 ' . but this movie is so so so bad . its embarrassing . do not rent it or buy it or view it on television . note 's : this film had some great talent a song from olivia newton jon , and ( one of my most personal favorites ) mila and my favorite comedians margaret cho . she 's to good but ... why this film , she ( and mila ) are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this .

1	words can not express how glad i am the adventures in motion pictures company made available matthew bourne 's swan lake on dvd . the cliché thing to say is it 's `` amazing '' , `` genius '' , `` sexy '' , `` masterful '' ... but it is all those things and more . you 've never see anything like this . to me this `` modern '' swan lake is now the definitive classic of a classic -- i ca n't nor do i want to imagine the swan roles as anything but manly now . the leads adam cooper and scott ambler are not only great dancers , they are great actors . their chemistry is enjoyable to behold -- and just as believable as the chemistry the traditional swan lake man/woman pair conveys . in fact , a male swan is more provocative *because* it 's not the typical sad , delicate princess from all other versions . instead we see something new and wonderful -- a true creature of beauty , power and majesty who utterly captivates the prince ( and the audience ) in every way . the male duets and solos in this show are just ... wow . i brought this dvd to my best friend 's house and i was unsure what she would think , she 'd never seen any ballet let alone one so un-traditional as this . my fears were put to rest in act ii . once the swan appeared she did n't take her eyes away the rest of the night . we both watched in silence as if mesmerized . it was a fantasitc feeling to watch it with someone else and see them be amazed . the music helped too , swan lake has by far some of the best music ever written for the stage . surely many people who are n't normally ballet watchers would appreciate this show -- its humor , universal themes of forbidden love , the unique way the swans look and act like real birds , and above all else powerful manly dancing -- definitely something for everyone ! share this with someone you love , quick ! !
1	this episode is a classic , and is one of the best in the series . it explores time travel and alternate time lines , and it 's storytelling had paved the way for many screen plays that followed .
0	i ordered this the night of the oscars . i will assume the mad rush to make as many dubs as possible was the reason for this atrocious copy . there was n't even a booklet or insert of any kind included in the packaging . it looks like a bad vhs transfer . i should have returned it , but it would 've been more trouble than it was worth . i thought the movie was everything it was cracked up to be - but unfortunately , in my case , i have to add : buyer beware .
1	seriously , one of my favorite movies of all time . thank goodness for 1980 's rewinds . kate hudson 's character is ridiculous , in the absolute best sense of the word . oh , and , martha plimpton never ages ... she 's a freak of nature . now get off the computer and let 's go party risa garcia style . f*** yeah
1	i first watched this movie in a class . a professor showed this movie and talked about oedipus complex . i am not sure about this concept in it but sure enough this is an excellent movie
1	darkness ( for those who wonder what the title film means ) is not the only time of the day tenebre 's would-be victims should be afraid of when a psychopath starts imitating the murders of one best-selling author 's latest creation . before you can even say what the -- , this 1982 horrorfest has already delivered the goods with style and flair . never has it been more fun to witness the untimely premise of its cast . with a touch of ingenuity from its director and a killer-score to boost , tenebre is a strong and inspiring piece of film that is a definite must-see . undoubtedly one of the best efforts of dario argento 's career. -- -- -martin bouche
1	a very funny and insightful examination of young adults all looking for love , happiness and meaning . the film takes place on new year 's eve , 1981 , and follows many different young people who somehow all eventually end up at the same party ( which the hostess later wakes up to find she slept through . ) elvis costello makes a cameo and provides a running joke in the last third . the soundtrack is great -- all late 70 's early 80 's pop and new wave . and the one who steals the show is dave chappelle as the cab driver who manages to give a ride to practically every character at some point , dispensing equally silly and profound wisdom along the way , on everything from friendship and destiny to life before an afro and how to `` get booty . '' ( smiling at a girl is very important , as is avoiding talking about death -- '' everyone knows they 're gon na die someday , they just do n't want to hear it from you . '' ) ben affleck is very amusing as a clueless suitor . oh , and courtney love was actually bearable . all in all , a very smart , enjoyable ride
1	eyewitnesses are given too much credibility and are notoriously inaccurate . conspiracy buffs have fashioned an industry out of events told and retold but this footage is the best witness . it is also horrific to watch . i had heard the parkland surgeons all talk about a head wound behind the president 's right ear . they should know , they were there right ? the film shows otherwise . if there is a conspiracy it is a well kept secret , show me someone who can keep a secret . if the us government is hiding evidence why is this footage available ? no one can tell where a shot came from by the target 's movement . the answer to where jfk 's missing brain is here , the third shot pulverized it , turning it into a red mist . had this film never existed the conspiracy people would have made millions more but the answers to their questions are in this footage . this is history which can not be retold by bad historians or knuckleheads . see for yourself
0	this was my first download of this type and also my last . i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare . there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless . the machines keep freezing up . the idea is nice but the technology is n't there yet
0	the first half if they had made movies back then , in 1871 , it would move as slowly as this . perhaps that date suits the film to perfection . the days of utter simplicity , with nearly nothing happening . where maybe days are filled with yourself . not distractions . after half an hour , all i could think was , if this was on tv , not only would everybody switch off , the sh** ( show ) would be axed . it may even beat so many foregin movies as the slowest movie of all time . but slow really means empty . the other half ( of me ) yet i have since come to learn , by others ' reviews , this is a movie which you must make , by the mood , or the feeling of dread others speak of . or else you are left with the feeling of dead . i failed to do that , and without that , the film fails miserably i reckon . perhaps because i am dead . so , therefore , i envy those creative creatures of subtle senses . or whether it was because they were so simple , or easily pleased , which means more modest , more modern . so , as in real life , it 's only the feeling which makes anything real . my first ( or worst ? ) half the other part of me thought that , the film being a feature length , they think they can just not try for half an hour , an hour . such is the problem with many filmakers , even today . when , being a torture , err feature , they should try much harder ! ! therefore the atmosphere spoken of in these reviews can only be like saying there is smoke without fire . virtually nothing happens , and what does makes little sense , as any unconcious creation . my better half of the schizophrenic but the acting of the lead lady is expressive and genuine , and not being stereotype ; is pleasingly real . weird as suits the role . as are the others natural , with no hollywood posing . how often have i heard that story - good acting , bad film ? oh i 'm sorry , i did it again . the only thing exciting is the title . the whole my conclusion is : i do n't know which is my better half , and which is my worst half . . . ? so , all things being unequal , i choose both . i stand and fall by both my views . ( i guess that 's why god gave us 2 eyes . ) i was going to give it only one star* at first , but now i give it merely two** , knowing i 'm still mean . i see this movie as perhaps the greatest measure of one 's temperament . if you feel better than me , are supernaturally sensitive , or have the patience of a saint to me , add one , two , or three more stars respectively . i intend to watch it again , and then maybe i can give a before and after shot . please feel free to reject me , write negative comments about me , or scare me . or kill me .

0	i thought this movie was decent but nothing spectacular . it kept me awake but just on the verge . the few comical scenes helped to keep me interested as did the totally unexpected ending which was probably the best part of the entire movie . i thought the acting in this movie was just mediocre at best . overall i was not impressed with the movie but the few good scenes earned it two stars over just the lonely one star .
0	sorry but i totaly disagree with all these positive reviews.i 'm a fan of war classic films but this one is a mess.nothing is moving , action is zero and filming is poor . we are very far away from dirty dozen , battle of the bulge , midway , enemy below etc ... . a total waste of time and money
0	i bought this dvd because a friend said it was one of the funniest films he had ever seen . we 're still friends , but i 'll never listen to one of his reviews again -- our taste must not be compatible . my wife , daughter , and i seldom agree on anything but we unanimously consider this the worst movie we 've ever seen . it 's the only movie i 've ever turned off before the end . on the plus side , watching most of this film has given me a new perspective on cinema . i used to think i knew bad movies . now i know that most movies are at least pretty good , and it 's only a very few that are truly bad . this is one of those very few bad films . best in show belongs to a genre of `` comedies '' that i find boring at best , but often cruel and mean . other films of this type are `` waiting for guffman '' , `` bottle rocket '' , etc . if you enjoy watching pathetic people struggle then perhaps you 'll appreciate this movie
0	an accessible story with all the elements of a great american novel was somehow transformed into a perverse , worst of the worst abc afterschool specials . if you had not read the book , you would be unable to follow what was happening . some of the worst directing and editing i have seen in a long time . the original evil dead , with all its flaws , is a better put together film than this one . this movie is flat-out painful to watch . you get no justifications whatsoever as to why the characters behave as they do . it all seems so random . read the book . if you see this movie in a rental store , just move along , please , nothing to see here
0	i have friends who might be into this stuff , if only because they like the old and the strange . me , i 'm just like -- is this `` it 's a wonderful life '' ? i think i might have enjoyed this more if it was a novel or maybe if i picked up the script . as it is , this just barely seems to translate into a movie , and -- forgive me for i have my own opinion -- '' city of angels '' was a good movie . too bad if you do n't like all this `` contemporary nonsense . '' i feel like it worked . my opinion : it 's long , it 's boring , it 's hard to hear . even if it has a message , i just ca n't relate to it . so maybe that 's my problem . your opinion : your own . keep it . you 're lucky i gave it two stars
1	i can not believe how mean and down-dirty elections can get when they get too close . does it tell us something about the election process . it needs to become kinder . democracy can be great if we work a little harder at it . it can be done ! it would have been nice to see more opinions of those on the right ... the film did seem to have a bit of a biased edge to it , like it was pushing an agenda . good awareness piece though .
0	this movie made me sick to my stomach . here we have a woman like nora ephron , a woman with professional job skills and talent and when she marries , she turns into a needy , desperate women whom evidently believes her own self-worth is determined by having babies , one after another . i ususally love all of meryl 's movies , but i could not stand seeing her turn into a needy , always pregnant `` homemaker '' . if i were a man , i would have run awary screaming , too
0	i love nature and cowboy movies . jeremiah johnson was on of the best movies i 've seen . it is unforgetable . it was my favorite robertredford movie . he did very little talking talking in this movie , he just acted , his best performance ever . the movie deals with the american indian also , in a profound and touching way . this movie is engrossing and based on a true story , it 's simply the best . do n't miss the opportunity to see this movie , it is a classic . it truly is in a league of it 's own .
0	three years after the first mortal kombat film , fans could n't wait for annihilation to come out . unfortunately , the sequel did not do well at the box office and after viewing it , i can see why . first , i will start with what is positive about the movie . kitana had more of a role as did jax , i preferred sandra hess as sonya a little over bridget wilson even though she did a good job with sonya 's character in the first movie , some of the fight scenes ( jax vs. cyrax , sonya vs. mileena , liu kang vs. baraka , sub-zero vs. scorpion ) were sequenced good , the dvd bonus features were nice , and the soundtrack was awesome . these positive aspects , however , could not save the overall film from disappointment . so what went wrong ? like the first mk , annihilation attempted to blend two mortal kombat games into one movie ( mortal kombat 3 and ultimate mortal kombat 3 ) . unlike the first mk , however , the blend was not successful . too many characters were put into the movie and therefore the character development for most of them was almost non-existent . aside from that , only three of the actors to my knowledge returned from the previous movie though it is understandable why the other actors did not return . what else went wrong with this sequel ? some of the acting was either over-the-top and/or downright pitiful . shao kahn 's character along with raiden 's character was poorly resembled . also , some of the characters did n't even get much screen time at all . one flaw that is immediately noticed at the beginning of the movie is that one of the main characters gets killed off ( i wo n't say who because it is probably obvious ) . while some of the fight sequences were good , most of them were rushed and some were just flat-out ridiculous . this goes double for the animality sequence . sadly , mk annihilation does n't rank up with the first one . despite all this , there is some good news . after eight long years of waiting , a third mortal kombat film will hit the big screen with most of the actors returning from the first movie . plus , the third installment will not only kontinue where the first left off but will also ignore the events of annihilation
0	okay , so to catch up on this exciting new series , i decided to try this revolutionary downloading program - amazon unbox ! i selected the first 10 episodes and hit purchase . minutes later , i was watching the first episode , it came quickly , sounded great , and looked wonderful ... however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end . forgiveable , until ... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video , making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing . but , this is a good concept ... unfortunately , amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality ! so , until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds ... do not try and download season 1 , episodes 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 ! ! ! 1 , 3 , 8 , 9 , and 10 were the only ones that were 100 % complete for me
0	years after its release i find myself writting what i consider a completely biast review for this film ( being somewhat of a star wars fan had made it difficult to look at it with any negative light before ) . let me first start by saying that my two daughters love the film . for me , i grew up watching the original star wars ( now titled episode iv , a new hope ) . when the original star wars came out , it changed the way people looked at sci-fi . i saw it several times just to be able to focus on the different aspects of the sets , props , costumes , etc . it was the best eye-candy of its time by far . substance became less of an important factor and if the movie had a couple of `` holes '' in the story we forgave it and watched-on mesmerized by its visual splendor and the likability of its characters . almost thirty years later the panorama is completely different . star wars movies still hold the bar for special effects but in a computer-generated world , amazing visuals ocurr within any television comercial , even the lowest budget sci-fi television show has special effects that are somewhat convincing or at least cool to look at . effects do not make a movie and `` attack of the clones '' is more about effects than story or even acting for that matter . awfully silly dialogue does n't help it neither . in retrospect , i wish that george lucas would have come up with two completely different droids than c3po and r2d2 ( the latter even flies ! imagine that , more capabilities than in the future ) . this premise is even absurd for the world of star wars . according to the story , luke skywalker and his uncle owen in episode four bought two droids that are about thirty to forty years old . as i 'm typing this review i can imagine myself typing it with a royal ribbon typewriter , that just would n't happen . it is scary to find things that are even too far-fetched for the world that lucas created but the movie is full of them . he does n't really give any explanation in the whole trilogy ( i , ii , iii ) as to why in the future the ships are not as cool or look and act clunkier , or why everything looks dated thirty years from now . in his world technology goes backwards and not the other way around . i , however have a solution for all these . george lucas should keep meddling with the original trilogy until all that is left from the original films is the faces of the protagonists . everything else should be computer re-generated in order to keep pace with a future more in sync with its past . then , you could buy all versions of the original trilogy ( iv , v , vi ) . as originally shot , the revised version that we all saw in re-release on the theaters , and the `` ultimate enhanced version '' to better match the second trilogy ( i , ii , iii ) . maybe he could even re-edited where the actors look as if they had no personalities and change the dialog to sound more confusing . then , you would have a whole set of six films that look fantastic but lack in every other aspect of story telling ( ie. , compelling characters , continuity , interesting plotlines , etc ) . the only reason i give the movie two stars is because the wonderful effects created by ilm still makes the film worth watching at least once . otherwise , i rather watch `` serenity '' which has a more star wars feel to it than this star wars film . the nickname of `` mannequin '' to `` annakin '' is well-deserved as it is any negatives regarding the characters of this poorly told story
1	hey if you have all seen the works of argento and fulci then you probably understand how illogical giallo is . this was not always the case and some of them come across as quite alright in the end . i would actually recommend this argento 'primative slasher ' over fulci 's `` do n't torture a duckling '' - not anywhere near as good as its giallo hype , this version of the bird with the crystal plumage i watched was uncut and a lot more violent than the pg version that has less murder violence , but is still dark all the same . although i give this five stars , it is more of a three star movie , but this is the one that started a whole cult wave of stuff like this , and for that it is recognized and prized , but you have seen better argento and giallo , i recommend that you get susperia before this . i say stay away from `` do n't torture a duckling ''
0	i did not like this movie . i know that times have changed and it would be revisionist to hold this movie to millennium standards of sexual conduct and infidelity . nonetheless , i found it very disturbing : his lack of concern for his wife and children , how the wife was unsympathetic and one dimensional , and how absolutely de rigueur it was in the sixties for married men to have `` a bit on the side . '' and what about her kids ? apart from the first scene we never see them again ; she instead seems to spend all her time cooking and keeping house for a married man . i 'm not a prude , really , but this film left a bad taste in my mouth
0	richard pryor is my all-time favorite stand-up comedian . i consider him the best in the business . but his performance in live and smokin shows he 's still just a rookie . he 's nervous in front of the camera , and says so several times . his material is typically raunchy , but not very funny . you can hear the forced laughter from a few members of the audience . buy this tape only if you 're a die-hard pryor fan , but do n't expect the side-splitting laughter you 'll get from in concert , live on the sunset strip , and here and now
0	i 'd give this movie a negative star if i could . avoid this movie . it 's terrible . not one positive thing could be said about this movie
0	to begin with the movie tootsie is classified as a genre of romance and comic.this movie is produced in new york . the protagonist is michael dorsey and he is the most important character in the film.the situation of this movie is of a man that is a talent actor but for reasons of money he decides to dress like a woman.for the reason that he can not continue woring in the job he has and that his manager tell him nobody would hire him because he is unemployed by that time . so there is where dorothy appears and he starts working as a women is a soap opera in televison where he becames so famous . he gets the job here but he did it without having the intention of hurting anyone and also anyone in the place knew that he was a man dresses like a woman.in addition he falls in love with one of the woman that works with him in the soap opera . thre is only one friend that knows what he is doing . he has one problem and is that his bestfriend falls in love with him but he did n't treat her well for the reason that he is in love with the other woman.the characters of this movie are really good actors evryone seems to knoe what they are doing.the way the character acts in the movie is ok and the decision the man takes to wear women 's clothin instead of try to find a job in the way he is seems to me very intelligent . because he could only accept that he was unemployed but no he decides to do something so that he could work . the stes in the movie are really well done and i like the part where the father of the woman that acts in the ospa opera gives a ring to dorothy without knowing thta she was a man.the lightnoing is was ok in every scene you could see everything ok and well iluminated . the costumes the actors used where a little diffrerent form he ones we use right now but eventhough they were not the same they look ok.furthermore th emusic they put inspires the movie to look more interesting , there were not that much music but it was ok . this movie could be reall in life because sometimes when people dont have jobs or they got fire they do everything they can to have a job . i will really recommend this movie to my audience because itis interesting to see how his man do all that work with enthusiam and it really leave us a message of life .
1	in the mid-'50s , columbia released a trio of nifty black-and-white `` monster '' movies : it came from beneath the sea , earth vs. the flying saucers and 20 million miles to earth . aimed squarely at the youth market , each of these films run less than an hour and a half , and are brave and spunky as they feature a human race that always survives and is better as a result of the battles with the monsters . most importantly , each has spectacular special effects by the master , ray harryhausen . in the years before computer-generated graphics , monsters were either created by very sophisticated cartoons , or , in the case of harryhausen , a technique called `` stop action , '' in which models would be shot a frame at a time ; natural movement was suggested by moving the figures slowly , frame by frame . this was time-consuming , painstaking arduous , and for non-fans , pretty cheesy . but the cheesiness is , in a way , more than half the fun . populated by such grade b through z performers as hugh marlowe , faith domergue and william hopper , these movies are a comfy as a pair of old slippers and a well-worn robe . these quick morality tales are a hoot and holler ; a campy , yet and faintly embarrassing , art form that demands the cliché `` so bad that they 're good . ''
0	the man died as he lived a loser . this uneducated thug was nothing more than a racist piece of crap . plain and simple truth . the only praise he deserves is praise that he is dead . thats one less racist thug off the streets . a two year old can write better music than he did . heck calling his stuff music is an insult to music and musicians every wher
1	to say this is a great film is probably an overstatement , but it certainly is a great idea for a film . gibson looks good , weaver looks good , hunt acts good , weir directs good , and the script is better than good . much . it 's a movie about ideas , which earns high marks these days , as so few flics can make that claim . sure , it stumbles a bit , and the ending is purposely frustrating , to carry forward the theme of white guilt and `` what then shall we do ? '' beyond all that , it 's sensual , and unpredictable , and pretty damned intelligent . seen anything lately in the multiplex that fits that bill ? i ai n't . see it for yourself .

1	it 's a beautifull movie . one of the bests to watch with your girlfriend . hghly recomended
1	i have always loved this movie , but especially love the music used in the soundtrack . it lifts the soul
1	tangled is actually a really good movie . you have to pay attention or you 'll get lost in the plot but other than that it was a great movie
1	i came to this film after rave reviews from friends , so perhaps i was expecting too much . there is much to admire here ; the acting is top-notch , the contrast between chatty characters and completely silent people in the opening interview scenes is well-crafted , and the plot premise itself is a fascinating one . for me , films are all about endings , and i felt in this area after life did n't quite pay off . i did n't really buy into the romance , and wanted to know more backstory about the female character so i could care more whether she gets the guy or not . i also thought they could have cut it a bit more - it feels 10-15 minutes too long to me . however , these are minor criticisms ; it is a film i will watch again , and recommend to japanese film fans , especially those who like the more slow-paced japanese films such as eureka , moe no suzaku and sonatine

1	i bought it on amazon a few days ago ( i saw the movie a long time ago but just now bought it ) and got it today . the movie is awesome . nick nolte and martin short make an awesome team . the story is probably the best part of the entire movie . it 's about an ex-con named lucas ( nick nolte ) who just gets out of jail and immediately gets involved in a bank robbery commited by ned ( martin short ) . there are so many funny scenes on here . here are the funniest ones : 1 . they think ned ( martin short ) is giving birth ( he stuck a teddy bear up his shirt to make it look like he was pregneant ) 2 . when doctor horvath ( kenneth mcmillan ) gives his story about lucas ( nick nolte ) ( tells about the `` hunting accident '' ) and there are a few more . there is even a bit of drama in the movie , most of it involving ned 's daughter , meg ( sarah rowland doroff ) . this movie is perfect . i recommend it to everyone . if you have n't seen it yet , you must see it now . because if you do n't , you 're missing out
