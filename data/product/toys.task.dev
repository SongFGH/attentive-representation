1	i looked for years to get the bozo punching bag as it was a part of my youth . finally i located it and purchased it for my grandson , 7 . he loves it as does all of his family who use it to take out their frustrations . lol built very sturdy as he drags it around the backyard as well
0	i ordered the smack and yack : disney cars sally , lightning and ramone for christmas . the only one of them that worked consistently after a few minutes was ramone . sally and lightning only worked sporadically after a few minutes and then after about an hour , they would n't work at all . i ended up having to order the same ones again because my daughter was so upset that they stopped working on christmas . i hope the new ones work for a longer time than the orginal purchases
1	i bought this doll on ebay for my daughter for christmas because it wasnt available in stores . my daughter who just turned 6 yrs old loves this doll . doll speaks both english and spanish . the only thing i dont like is that this baby keeps going to sleep after meals , but if your child wants to keep it awake you can press the bracelet or put the bottle in the mouth . its a good thing if you dont want to run out of batteries soon or to give the doll some rest
0	my 7 year old son received the giga ball for christmas . it was a big hit . he and all of his cousins had a great time with it for several hours . unfortunately , the very next day , it pretty much fell apart . i did n't expect it would last very long , but had hoped that it would last more than one day
1	i played `` atmosfear , the harbingers '' on vhs in the mid-90s and several years later bought a copy of the game through ebay . then , i saw this dvd update and gave in to temptation when the price was marked down . here 's my judgement : 1 ) the mechanics have been simplified . this has it 's pros and cons . it could have been made easier to learn without removing as many components . 2 ) the gatekeeper has less of a nasty/funny balance in the dvd update . 3 ) it is a major upswing to have his dialogue randomly disbursed . one reviewer seemed to think the game was boring . i 'll guess , instead , that the people he parties with do n't have the attention span for board games . too bad for them . atmosfear - the dvd board game get 's a b+ from me
0	quick shipping on product but the product was not what i was hoping for . the `` snow '' was much grainer than i had expected . i had seen what i thought was the same item in stores during the holiday season and that `` instant snow '' was very fine and really looked like snow . this product does n't look much like snow and does n't have the same texture
0	this is one of the most beautiful looking barbies we have ever bought . it is also the worst doll to date ! the doll never worked from day one . it 's tail bent up and it made grinding noises and did n't move or swim - just laid there . all the reviews on this site ( which seemed to have disappeared since i notified mga - the toy maker ) were correct - not one buyer had a working doll ! ! ! we bought this for my daughter , niece and friend - and none of the 3 worked . it 's not hard to follow the directions - they are pretty simple - so that is not the problem . also , the hair falls out and is everywhere in the bath water ( pretty gross ) , and the bikini top is near impossible to get back on correctly ! overall , the biggest disappointment in a toy so far
1	my son is 4 1/2 and he loved the set . he and his dad set it up on christmas and enjoyed ringing the bell . i would recommend this for kids any age
1	he 's into firetrucks and mickey mouse so you could n't ask for a better toy . it 's small enough to ride around the house without running into everything , but also durable enough to play outside with . it 's the first thing he goes for in the morning and the last thing he 's playing with at night ( most days )
1	this thing is great . our 4 year old loves it . the working drawbridge , breakaway wall for cannon fire and trap door are great . considering the size and number of pieces , it was remarkably easy to put together . allow 2 to 3 hours for assembly , but the directions are excellent . only complaint is that some of the small pieces that do n't always want to stay together - some of the `` details '' will likely be missing after a few weeks . overall , very happy with it
0	my son received this as a gift when he was 15 months old -- he was already much too tall for the toy ! the box advertizes height adjustment , which simply allows you to lift it up about a half an inch . however , even if he were smaller , the base does not even come close to providing the necessary stability to stand up to even a soft swing ! my son was amused by the lights and sounds for a brief period of time , but quickly lost complete interest in the toy .
1	i bought this for my 5-year old daughter . she really enjoyed using it and actually enjoyed the challenge of having to figure out the answers in the shortest time possible . the different levels of difficulty are useful so she can keep using it over the years
0	i got this as a gift for my 18 month old son . it only produces one lousy bubble with each pull of the handle , very sad . my son got very frustrated and so did i. i would not recommend this product .
1	i first purchased the winnie the pooh soft 'n silly tigger for my son when he was 4 months old . he is now 14 months and loves his tigger . we now have 2 tiggers , one as a back up , and he carries them everywhere he goes . it 's a great toy for young children to sleep with , being soft and cuddly . tigger has been a great comfort for my son and i do n't know what i would have done with out them !
0	i ordered 6 supreme moo mixers . they did arrive before christmas . i received 6 standard moo mixers that should have been priced lower . i notified the company of the error and did n't receive a response . very disappointed . shame on them . i 'm a victum of bait and switch ... .
1	we gave our nine yr. old grandson this train for christmas . he had a such a good time putting it together , then running it on the track . the train absolutely glides on the track , so quietly and smoothly . it is a great product
0	i bought this for my son 's birthday last night since he is interested in music . as i was wrapping it , i noticed half of the keys were stuck in the up position . i took it out and managed to bang the keys back into place , wondering how many times i was going to have to do this . i decided to test it once i fixed it because the toy just looked horribly cheap with very thin plastic keys ( you can even see through them ) . the dollar store has better toys than this . the sound is horrible and uncontrollable . the controls are worthless . i 'm returning it today , and good riddance
0	i think this product needs a lot of hands-on supervision . my son slipped off and knocked the wind out himself twice on the 2nd day of trying this . after a couple of weeks , he finally regained his confidence to try it when a friend was over -- and his 6 y.o . friend slipped and knocked the wind out of herself ( almost had to call the paramedics ) . knowing what i know now ... i would not buy this product for kids under 8 ( follow the age recommendations ! ! ! ! ! ) . i would like to take a pair of wire cutters and cut it down ... .
0	my 6 year old son wanted this so badly from santa . well , he got it and it is sitting in his bedroom and has been there since the 28th of dec. what was a fun attention grabber initially became a boring , furry annoyance rather quickly . it is cute but there are several things that i ( and my son ) found wrong with the product . when he is supposed to be sleeping his eyes do n't close all the way ... kind of creepy especially for something that looks so real ! then his arms that move up and down and are supposed to close in an attempt to give you a hug make a horrible grinding noise ! my son was shocked by the grinding and got upset that his monkey was broken . i explained it away by saying that he probably just needed a backrub . what else are you going to tell a child on christmas morning when his first choice present turns out to be a bummer ? ! cute toy in theory , not so much in person though . i would not recommend this toy
0	it says that it works with vibration , maybe if you are dancing on a trampoline . the kids are not really that impressed
1	we recently played bonkers at our game club . as we read the instructions we were hoping going bonkers would be fun and it was . bonkers is a game based on asking players questions . the questions are not trivia and knowledge-based questions , but instead word-based questions . for instance , a question might ask you to `` come up with words that end in bell '' . during your turn you have 30 seconds to `` go bonkers '' trying to blurt out answers like : barbell ; dumbbell ; doorbell , cowbell etc . your goal would be to find as many answers as possible in order to hit any or all of the four answers provided on the game card . for every answer you hit , you win scoring chips . that was just one category of questions called add ons - where you find words that begin or end with a certain word . the other categories are : what the blank - where you find words to complete the blank ; rhyme time - where you find as many rhymes as possible in order to match those provided on the game card ; and letter perfect - where you would find words which begin or end with certain letters . the game play is interesting because there is some strategy thrown in . at the beginning of the round , one player ( the card reader ) peeks at the question and answers on game card and decides how many scoring chips each answer is worth . so , in the example above , the card reader might allocate 5 scoring chips to the answer cowbell , four chips to barbell , three chips to dumbell and two chips to doorbell . this is done by placing the chips on the gameboard under target answer `` a '' ; `` b '' , `` c '' or `` d '' . the object is for the card reader to decide on which answers are hardest and place the most scoring chips on the hardest answer . this is because if the players do not hit some or any of the answers provided on the game card , the card reader will win the scoring chips leftover and advance on the board . however , if the players hit all or any of the answers on the game card , they win the scoring chips for the correct answers provided . i really like the strategy part of the game , it adds a good deal of spice . bonkers provided for an entertaining evening . we will play again !
1	i originally bought this monkey on vacation . i showed it to my son and he grabbed it and hugged it . how could i not buy it for him doing that ? it was so soft and cuddly and the feet are like beany babies . i eventually ordered a 2nd one from amazon for my parents house . so now i do n't have to drag it from house to house . as he gets older , he is liking it more and more
1	people say that the iquest stinks because it does n't have all their text books . but i honestly think that even though it may be a little different , there 's no harm in learning new things .
1	my daughter received this toy for her fourth birthday . she plays with it all the time ! ! ! it did n't come with any tapes and honestly she does n't need them ! she spends quite some time speaking into the microphone and using the slide to change the sound of her voice . it is so funny ! we all get a kick out of it . there are several different sounds to choose from . even her two year old twin sisters get into the act . they love it . love this toy . it 's extremely durable . would absolutely recommend this
1	this is a fun toy , just a bit difficult to stack because of the narrow wheels . you can ask which one is biggest , what color is this car , ask about the numbers on the cars , etc ... that is why i think it is educational to that respect . my son still has this , and is three years old and will play with it every once in awhile with his matchbox cars stacking them or just rolling them along
0	this looked to be a very cool item but what we thought was a miniature picture of the item turned out to be the item itself . how they expect you to enjoy a movie on a screen the size of a thumbnail is beyond me . fun idea to be able to carry this in your pocket but not worth it
0	wish i could give this a negative . when i did finally get a sticker out , it would n't stay stuck to anything for more than five minutes . ended up sending it back to the wholesaler as unworkable and overpriced
1	my 18-month old has been playing with this for three months now and just loves it . she even knows now which color balls goes in the correct slot . she whacks them all in , puts the balls back , and keeps doing this over and over and over
0	spongebob is making an obscene gesture . personally , i do n't think it is an appropriate toy for children . anyone that thinks spongebob is merely `` pointing '' a finger should n't be so naive as to how toys are marketed and the moral decline of our society ! !
1	we live in alaska and really wanted two of these games to pass on to our married daughters since it has been a holiday tradition to play . we found them for purchase on amazon but were displeased at the cost to ship to alaska . although we are part of the us and usps ships for a reasonable price , we were n't given that option and paid at least double what it could have been . ups and fedex rip off those of us in alaska while usps treats us just like everybody in the lower-48 . give us a usps option
1	this was the webkinz my daughter wanted , and she 's been very happy with it . there was a delivery problem , but the seller from whom i bought it was a pleasure to deal wit
0	it seems like a nice complete set of playfood , except that the boxes are really flimsy cardboard , and i 've thrown most of them out already . it does n't take much to crush them . there are much nicer sets out there , and there are separate pieces sold on ebay , that are probably used but will stand the test of your kids much better . not worth the money
0	my son received this for christmas 2005 and played with it every day . the conveyor belt is noisy when running and the sponges that whirl around at the end of the car wash were constantly falling off and getting lost . after a month of being played with on a daily basis the conveyor belt stopped working - it still made plenty of noise but did n't move anymore ! when i called mattel they could n't offer me replacement parts as the toy was discontinued in 2001 ! although they gave me a voucher to buy a replacement toy , it was n't for as much as i paid for the toy .
0	i 'm not sure how this toy ended up with a 4.5 star rating after all the broken microphones ! ! ours was yet another that broke within 2 months of gentle play . it was n't thrown or dragged around by the microphone or anything of the sort . my son loved it and figured out the microphone very quickly . he loved to see the lights and the little puppy `` dance '' when he `` sang '' into the microphone . i continued to let him play with it even after the microphone shorted out and the static began and he still kept trying the microphone until he got frustrated and then i finally put it away . i wish i had spent the money on something that would have lasted longer . my son is now 18 months old and the only other toy he has ever managed to break was the vtech nursery farm which was broken 3 weeks after christmas last year , just before this piano broke . i highly recommend fisher price or leapfrog toys over vtech . we have never had a problem with their toys and 2 of the 3 vtech toys we have owned have broken on us . garbage !
0	of all of the expensive gifts i purchased for christmas , this was the one thing my daughter played with consistently . the price is right and now they have free shipping . the one bad thing is that the cards are flimsy and we wore them out !
1	i noticed that this ladybug sand box only had 3 & amp ; 1/2 stars and the others all had 5 . i felt a need to speak up . we bought this sandbox for our first son when he was three . we lived in an apartment with a small back patio . it was perfect , not too big but still room for a toddler or two to sit in it and play . he played for hours ! ! now 5 years later , his little brother loves it and my first son , almost 9 , still plays with the little one in it . it still looks brand new , nestled under the tree in our big back yard . it 's really great just smaller than the others . we have since given this for every two year old birthday present we 've bought ! i highly recommend it
0	save your money ... because if you buy these for your kids you are going to need your money for the hospital ... .they do not work like you think that would..you kid is only bouncing on big rubber bands ... and fall ever time they try to bounce ... very dangerous..they are n't made for anyone..they should be taken off the marke
0	not only do you use chocolate syrup which runs off of the cookies , pretzels , strawberries , etc. , but it does n't even warm up the syrup . so , like someone else said , you may as well fill up a bowl with hershey 's syrup and let the kids dip away . the only reason i gave this two stars instead of one is because my kids did seem to have a really good time playing with this . they thought it was great even though it was cold syrup instead of warm chocolate
0	they show a pony in the picture . but you wo n't get it , just be careful when you think you will get the dining set and the pony . if you mistakly bought it . just keep it . you will only get partial refund which is half the buying price .
1	we are huge blues clues fans and this is our favorite blue ever ! his is really big and sooooo soft ! this buddy is much more cozy than the smaller beanie baby version . he is a great , cuddly , no frills ( no buttons to push or batteries to replace ) buddy ! my toddler sons love this blue
0	we are very disappointed in this product we purchased last summer . we constantly have many kids and adults of all ages over to our house because of our swimming pool and i do n't think we have found one person who has done more than try it once then walk away . also it is difficult to find the right size to hang it becasue of different sized people using it . not recommended
1	i read some of the reviews posted on this site before i bought this doll , i saw it on ebay but was afaird because of some the comments that was posted about the doll and thought i should buy it directly in case i needed to return it , but i had no problems at all other then the ubc cord the direction said to turn the cord one way when actually it is the other way , other then that i had no problem downloading anything and i ca n't wait to give this to my daughter for easter
0	we bought this for our son for christmas this year based on glowing reviews . what a disappointment ! the `` musical instruments '' are basically glorified rattles that all sound basically the same , the song the drum plays is tinny , scratchy , and short , and nothing seems very well made . i at least expected the different instruments to sound different from one another . on the plus side , it is cute , and the lobster has a pretty wind chime like sound
0	i bought this as a gift for my nephew . unfortunately it did n't work when it arrived , but fortunately my sister in law was able to take it to a local discovery store and exchange it for one that worked fine
1	when i was a little girl i stood along beside the table and watched the adults play . this was how i learned how to play the game . i have now been playing rook for about eight years and loved the style of cards shown above ( 90 's style ) . unfortunately , they have changed the style of the cards on us and i would like to purchase the 90 's style . if any come availible to purchase please be sure to email me and inform me of this so that i can buy some . i really dislike the new style of cards and all of my friends and family agree with me
0	my 5-1/2 year old son received this for christmas . he loves pirates and legos , so it seemed a perfect fit . we were wrong ! the mega bloks are poorly made , and it 's very difficult ( even for an adult ) to get the pieces to stay together . imagine how frustrating this is for a child ... ..we will never purchase mega bloks products again , we 're sticking to the original legos ! nothing more satisfying than spending money on a gift that makes your child scream and cry in frustration ... thanks megabloks
1	i love this doll i only saw her in the store and when i did i fell in love with her i cant wait to get her ! but i do think its a bit pricey but its worth the money
1	it is fun ! and most importantly educational . it has a game where you have to put the exact amount of money in the game slot . my kids like that part . they are 6 and 7 and ask me all the time if they can play their spongebob game , we are a two leapster family but they have to share their cartridges . next year my youngest will want one too , i am sure , as she wants to play theirs , but she is just too little yet , another year she will be 4 so will check into getting her one of her own then..
0	my son received this as a birthday gift and it broke the 2nd time that he played with it . while i was putting it on him the plastic belt just snapped in half . luckily we had a different belt from another toy that we could use with the gadgets . the previous reviewer was right about the difficulty of taking the gadgets on and off . there 's no way that my 4 year old son could do it without my help . if i had the receipt i would have returned it
0	the pieces were very tiny and the sticker flags kept popping off the plastic . my daughter 's favorite part was the pink and white horse with the carriage , which she promptly took over and put with her dollhouse . after asking santa for a cinderella castle she was a bit disappointed . this playset would probably be fine for a child who was just going to set it up and not play with it
1	my 3 year old son plays with them all the time . they are a little challenging and he loves to see the completed puzzle . the box is great and keeps the puzzles separate . each puzzle peice is marked on the back for easy sorting . i am ordering all of the boxed sets asap
1	my daughter had a 12 dancing princess party and she loved the game . it 's a little tricky for her to do the set up , but she enjoys playing it
1	this is a toy that my son always wants to play with and we 've had this dinosaur for quite a while now . usually , we buy our son a toy that he pleads for ( he likes it soooooo much ) and it looks like fun but then it ends up in the back of his closet after a few days of playing with it . this brontosaurus makes a booming sound with his feet when you pull a trigger underneath which both my sons love ( 4 2 ) and the included figures are great . this toy stands up to the brutual tug of war that accompanies our two small boys and it is quite the bargain at the price . i highly recommend all of the dinosaurs and cavemen in this series . not only does it keep my sons busy ( oh yeah ) but it also helps built their imagination as i hear them tell each other all these stories about their dinosaurs . imaginext has even come out with `` new '' dinosaurs in this line which can be found at target or other stores ( i have found that tru has a limited selection ) .
0	in order to answer the questions in this edition of trivial pursuit you would need an encyclopedic knowledge of the minutae of snl . most of the questions were beyond the ability of my family , who have watched snl since it began , and who quote it frequently . i was very disappointed in this game .
1	we were very pleased with the service we received . our purchases were shipped in a timely fashion and came in good condition
1	my 2.5 year old border collie just loves the tunnel and we train with it a few times per week . since the agility tunnels for dogs are a bit pricey , i decided to try this more affordable kid 's tunnel instead . it 's not as heavy and robust as the official agility tunnels , but it has been serving me great for just about a year - there 's just some minor wearing around the rings and small toe nail runs in it - but it 's still very usable . my ratings would change a bit for kids though - probably a 3 for educational and 5 for durability
1	this is a fun toy for anyone who is a starwars and mr . potato head fan
0	i thought the art had a certain charm , and used strictly as a picture book for children who ca n't yet read , i think it 's quite nice . ( too bad you ca n't make up your own story to go with it . ) the moment the child starts to read , though -- better hide it quick , because ... unfortunately , the book reads like a condensed communist manifesto for kids ( as others have noted ) , or a socialist agenda primer . i do n't know for sure that 's what marcus pfister had as an aim , and i 'm not going to speculate on his politics . he has three kids and may raise them as he likes , and indulge in any such philosophical musings as float his boat . yes , i suppose sharing is nice . certainly sharing one 's talents and abilities for the betterment of others is a great thing -- but in america , we get paid for that ( charity is voluntary , not coerced ) . furthermore , stripping yourself of what makes you unique and interesting ( not necessarily better , just unique and interesting ) , or giving away all your possessions , is a lousy way to make and keep friends , is n't it ? is this book implying that somehow friendship can only be obtained by placating envy ( a negative personal quality that should be dealt with by self-examination and intent to change , not pandering ) ? is it saying that being interesting and having unique qualities is bad ? almost seems like it , at least to me . furthermore , there 's an overtone of `` only by belonging to a group can you have self-worth , '' which is as hoary a case of balderdash as ever i 've seen . of course , people who agree with that egregious sentiment will disagree with me , but that wo n't make them right . ( the two stars , if you must know , are for the art .
0	the pictures get jammed in the camera and are very hard to remove . one picture got stuck in there and so this toy was broken after about 2 days of play
1	the checkbook package was opened . no pieces were missing . but it was hard to glue the plastic to the cardboard to give it as a christmas gift
0	what a disappointment ! the music quality is very poor -- most of the `` intruments '' sound just like every other cheap kids electronic toy . the piano is probably the worst ; the animal voices all sound the same . i thought i 'd get better quality at the price , plus , the left speaker does n't work . my kids had a toy casio keyboard that cost $ 12.00 and was the size of an egg-carton , and its sound was vastly superior . i will likely have to go through the hassle of returning this .
0	we received this as a gift and did n't like it at all . my two year old used it for about a day . but it does n't go very far with the remote ( you ca n't just have it move across the floor ) and it 's very noisy ! if it is walked away from you can hear it in the other room still making an annoying noise . i 'd go with something else if you 're looking for a first remote control ca
0	i just recieved a fisher price magazine in the mail and thought this product would be a nice christmas gift . i was thinking that amazon would have a good price , but they are almost double what fisher price is asking . if you go to fisher price 's website this item is only $ 33.00 + $ 7.95 shipping and handling .
0	my daughters are a little young for this toy and are n't that into it yet . it is very cute , with lots of sweet , tiny , realistic pieces , and i can see it having lots of play value and somewhat educational . however , they made it so the arms are jointed in order that she can hold the baby . well , my daughter threw the doll on the floor at the doctor 's office and the bottom half of the arm fell right off . even if it had n't broken , you have to place the arms just right or they look totally strange . this is the least favorite barbie my girls own . if it were n't for the arms , this would be a great toy . oh , and the back of the dresser is open , so you ca n't really store the small pieces in it . not sure why they did n't just close it up to make storage easier .
0	this sudoku yd-638 puzzle is very hard to use . and i think of my self as a computer geek . to make matters worse the instructions are very poor . they may make sense to someone who has used this for years , but not to a new user . save you money to buy a different game .
0	i bought this game for my new family for christmas . this is not at all the game of life that i remember playing for countless hours as a child . first of all , my old game had all of the mountains , houses , and spinner permenantly attached to the game board . with the new version , all of these things have to be attached with each setup , which takes about 10-15 minutes and they are easily knocked off the board . also , the spinner is hard to spin and frequently comes off of its pivot . the cars are less sturdy and the people pegs do not stay in the car so you are constantly having to put the people back in the car . finally , the rules of the game have gotten more complicated and yet the meaning of the game has become more trivial . i think i will put this in the top of a closet or in a yard sale and go find my old version of the game to play in the future
0	my 2 year old son loves to `` cook '' and to serve mommy and daddy meals from his kitchen . my only complaint is that it falls over easily and it seems we are often picking it up off the floor . it is n't very sturdy , but i 'm not unhappy with this purchase
0	this toy is great fun but it is n't very durable . ours broke after about an hour . there was a loud pop and then it stopped erupting . i guess the plastic bladder must have given out . the kids were terribly disappointed
1	i 've enjoyed playing this game with people from around the world- it seems to work best with a group of people who have n't been hanging out together since childhood . it gets people talking and makes for an evening of all sorts of interesting stories- and you get to find out what interesting people your friends are
1	my son turned 4 on tuesday and i had bought this and was saving it as a birthday gift ! he absolutely loves it ! he has spent hours and hours of time already sitting and playing with this playset and his turtles . even my husband thinks it 's cool ! it was n't too difficult to put together and it stays together quite nicely ! great toy for a 4 year old that loves tnmt
1	i recently bought these 4 little dora dolls for my 4 yr old 's birthday . she really loves them . she plays with them all the time . it is a nice collection to her dora stash !
0	i ordered two soccer ball kits for my two young sons . they were unable to inflate either soccer ball on christmas day because neither of the accompanying pumps and needles worked . if there had been no accompanying pump and needle with each kit , i would have been better prepared ahead of time to have my own pump ready . i had to go out and buy new needles the day after christmas . we 'll try again another day to see if we can inflate the balls with a different pump
1	my 4 1/2 year old recieved this red engine last christmas , and for the first couple of months was used practically every day . ( and yes , i agree with the rest of the reviewers- buy rechargable batteries since this engine eats them , and prepare to be disappointed since it can not pull many cars up the hills without getting stuck . ) i will tell you that i can not believe my son has not touched this engine since . his complaint is that all it does is go around and around . instead , he enjoys playing out stories from thomas , or making up his own train sagas . my husband likes to watch the engine more than my son . i do n't know how other children play with their trains , but the battery operated engines just can not hold his attention for very long . nevertheless , for the first few months , watching it is really mesmerizing , i could watch it for hours . perhaps instead of buying this one engine , purchase a setup with more cars and track for the same money . it will probably get more use in the end
0	i did not buy this from amazon but sought it out here so i could vent about this outrageous product ( that 's 'outrageous ' in its traditional meaning , that it outrages me ) . this is two packets of colored dust , approximately the consistency of unmixed plaster . empty the plastic bags and the colored dust flies everywhere , mold it in your hand and it retains its shape for a few seconds before blurring and falling apart . my wife and i repeatedly checked the packaging to see if we should add water or do something else to make this usable but apparently not . the claim on the package is that it `` molds like dough , '' obviously intended to remind us of play-doh , but play-doh is a clay-like material that retains its shape and can , in fact , be molded . this material -- again attempting to compare itself to play-doh -- states that it wo n't dry out . of course not ! it 's dust ! it ca n't dry out , there 's nothing drier than dust . in case you 're wondering i have no connection to play-doh or its makers ( i do n't even know who does make it ) , i 'm simply the father of a 3-year old who uses play-doh often and hoped this product might be a workable addition to our playtime . wrong
1	well the space is limated but i learned how to deal with it . the set comes with four parts rainforestchamber , bug chamber , aquarium , and ant colony . the aquarium comes with triop eggs or you can put a goldfish in . then we have ant colony which the air holes are a bit to big . finally we have rain and bug chamber which to me are the best of all the four . the rain forest chamber can hold a small lizard or frog but since i bought this during winter i will have to wait till spring to catch a lizard . and we all know what you put in a bug chamber . over all i rate this four stars due to small space . p.s there a bug catcher in it as well
1	everything was great ! great bed , easy to assemble , my son loves it . though he still wants to sleep in my bed , but he does play in it , that 's a good sign , huh
0	my two year old absolutely would not leave the store without this and she still plays with it a year later . however , there are two problems . one , it immediately needed repair to the basic connections and , two , it has a pinching hazard between the basket and the frame . but of course , my daughter never noticed either of those . she simply loves to play with it , constantly , and has to take it on walks around the block
1	the x-23 figure availible on amazon.com is dressed in purple but there also is a black one - a variant that is alot harder to find [ i resorted to ebay for mine ] . the build of the figure is great - there 's so much articulation , it 's insane ; and her feet claws actually tuck under her shoes so they can be concealed which is beyond cool . the articulation , for the most part , is great . my only qualm with it is it makes her arms look funny but i can deal with that . she 's barely 6 inches tall , i do n't expect her to be perfect . however , the reason i 'm giving her three stars is because i feel the purple outfitted one is far inferior to the black outfitted x. i recieved my black clad x-23 first and expected the same figure but in a purple for my other one but i was wrong . the black x-23 has very dark brown hair that lays straight and lank while the purple x-23 's hair is jet black and windblown which makes her head almost impossible to move around . also , the thing that bothers me the most is that x 's eyes are green on the black suited version but on the purple suited version , they 're orange . i am a big x-23 fan and i understand that when she 's `` triggered '' , her eyes go crazy reddish orange , but that 's not something i really want to see sitting on top of my computer monitor . it 's kind of creepy ! and on a sidenote , when did x-23 wear purple ? in her comics she was either in black , dressed as a civilain or in the old wolverine costume [ which you can see in the comic that comes with x-23 ] . i would 've prefered a variant wearing the wolverine costume while the black x-23 was mass produced . so , personally , i would recommend hunting down the variant of x-23 for your collection . she looks nicer and , i think , is more true to the character
0	it wroke 2 minutes later after openning , my husbund try to fixed but surprice all the inside partes are `` plastic '' you can`t fixed . do not waist your money
0	it did n't even last 24 hours before it split at the seams in several different spots . do n't waste your money
1	these dominos are great for the hello kitty lover . my six year old loves them . do n't be fooled by the picture though , the tin is not full . if you ask me , there are not enough of them in there . the tin is filled about three quarters with plastic to hold the dominoes up in the window and make it look full . i would have rated it five stars if it had been full
1	very complete with a lot of things to play for hours . my daughter still plays with it , and she is now four years old . definitely it was worth it . highly recommended
0	i purchased this item for my son 's birthday . not well built as it needed lots of tape to keep it together and readjustments after each attempt to fly it . also appears to need the wind just right and thrown a certain way in order for it to fly . after a couple of days we were able to accomplish only one 2 min . successful flight . on the second day , after 15 mins of recharging the battery , the battery case and wires melted . have contacted company for a refund .
1	another nice product from playdough . worth the ten bucks or so.. we just bought this from amazon . this would make a cute birthday present for a young child , say 2 to 8 ? hard to give an age as i myself like to sit with my son and play ! enough play dough for the price and the bucket is really handy for storage . i would buy this again as a gift
1	my daughter got this for her 6th birthday . she absolutely loves it , as does her 3 year old sister . one of them is using it all the time . the 3 different tops on the wand are a little frustrating for my 3 year old , as she ca n't switch them out herself and comes running to have someone else switch the tops for her . my 6 year old has caught onto all of the dance moves and is able to do them along with the dvd . my 3 year old ca n't do them all , but she has a great time just doing what she can . both of my girls love cinderella , so they put on their dress up cinderella dresses whenever they do the dvd . i wish there was a way to order just an extra mat , though , so they could do the dvd together instead of fighting over who gets to stand on the mat
0	purchased five of these sets thinking they would be fun stocking stuffers . wanting to check out what i purchased , i opened one of the five . the geodes are tiny ( not as pictured ) . it was like breaking open dirt-clods ... that have a small empty space inside ... but not crystals . maybe it was a `` dud '' box , but will probably be returning the other four .
0	i recently purchased this item for my daughter who has been wanting to paint . i thought this would be great because the paint is in the brush and it wo n't be messy . although all this is true , both of us found it very frustrating that it was difficult to get out of the tube . if this is made for children , should n't it be easier to use and should an adult really have trouble with it
1	it was the most popular gift on his first birthday . he loved pushing it , sitting on it and moving the small animal figures . lots of different kinds of fun for him
0	most of the other reviews for this toy are correct . when it works my kids love it . and it is pretty cool when it works . but it does n't work very well very often . you need to find just the right car and everything needs to line up exactly . and even then the car crashes a lot . we have found one car ( out of about 200 ) that works somewhat well . but even with this car the success rate is about 1 in 15. so , read the reviews and make your own judgements . personally , i 'm glad this was a gift and i did not spend any money on it . my kids will still play with and enjoy it , but not as much as they would if it worked better
1	this is the first rc ( radio control ) aircraft i have ever flown , although i have raced rc cars for quite awhile . it comes fully assembled with a nice manual and even a quick intro dvd to get you in the air quickly . i started out in my living room and it has worked just great . with just a little trimming out the heli is very stable and easy for which to get a feel . i 've run it for a few hours now with no incidents and i 'm getting pretty good at hovering although i still have a tough time with head-in flight ( controls thus reversed ) . the blade cx rtf makes a great first heli or just a great indoor heli . probably fine for anyone over 10 years old . i am getting 10-15 minutes of flight time on a battery charge . the only disappointment is that charging a battery takes 60-90 minutes ( typical with all lipo batteries ) . i 'd recommend getting an extra battery or two and maybe even an extra powersupply and charger . also i have tried the training gear add-on for the blade cp/cp pro -- it fits the cx just fine and allows you to use it later if you move on -- and it helps with damage but makes the blade cx slightly less stable in hover in my opinion but not terribly so . they 're probably worth the trade off at first . in a few more hours i think i 'll be ready to move up to the blade cp pro . highly recommended for anyone interested in entering rc helicopters or who just wants a heli to fly around the house . two good sites for further info are [ ... ]
0	unless you are prepared to be constantly putting the ropes and the masts back on the ship , this toy is a complete waste of money . my son had been wanting the black pearl for quite some time and this was a huge disappointment to him . buyer beware
1	love this new edition to yatzee . it is so handy to have the tray so your dice do n't go flying everywhere . this game is really a good game for the whole family
1	my grandson has truly enjoyed the easyscore basketball set from the first day he tried it . wonderful to have the adjustment for heightening as he grows .
0	my husband and i just bought the family feud 2nd edition dvd tv games . i have to say we both loved this game when it was first on ( and on gsn as repeats ) and i like the computer version . we played this once by ourself and a couple of times with friends and we all have found that this game was boring as someone said they ca n't believe they put this out . if you are going to get this game then buy the computer version . you have 5 rounds round # 1 round # 2 double money round triple money round fast money round you have team a and team b . if you get one wrong answer and you click wrong then it says go for steal . however , you only get one x . per guide ... if an answer is revealed that team a did not have written down , they press wrong answer button and pass the remote to team b . team b now has the opportunity to steal the round . so most of the game was passing the remote back and forth . if the steal answer matches any one of the remaining answers they steal the round ( even if you-team a had that written down ) and takes the money for any answer the other team has answered correctly ( even if they got 4 out of 5 and both teams say have the same answer ) the game itself was simple and basic . there was no real fun to it . we tried to play it with others and they said afterwards that they found it boring and not all that fun . one person said they would have more fun watching the game itself on tv over playing this version of the game . you get two markers ( red and blue ) to write on the two wipe-clean score cards . the negative on this is that the markers do not write all that good on these cards even though they were meant to . another thing is that the same game will come up more than once . we had the same question and answer come up even though we only played twice . this is the 3rd or 4th dvd game we have been given or bought . this is the only one where we disliked it so much after playing it a couple of times that we are giving it away as we will not be playing it again
1	my son loves the imaginext dino collection . he has almost all of them . they 're durable , fun and educational
0	a one star rating for this toy is way to charitable . the car does nothing but jerk , and thats only when repeatedly hitting the button . disney should be a shame of themselves for marketing this toy ! surely they had to have an idea about their product 's poor performance . my advice is everyone should print off the reviews from amazon and all like it . with this in hand , march into disney stores and demand ( 1 ) their money back ( 2 ) an apology . the only thing less reliable than this was my 1991 gmc jimmy
0	i bought this for my son 's first birthday . he loved it ! but , after only a month it stopped quacking and he lost most interest in it . he still plays with it a little bit , but not like when it made noise . i would n't have wasted my money if i had known the batteries would only last a month
0	the canopy bar broke only two days after christmas . now i have a sharp end on the bed frame . not good for little fingers . for the price , i thought it would have been a lot more sturdy
0	my 7 year old saw the ads for digidraw and drove me absolutely crazy until christmas rolled around last year . the look of excitement and happiness on his face as he unwrapped this toy was short-lived . it was nearly impossible to assemble . the time and patience it required to 'trace ' just a straight line was too much for an adult let alone a 7 year old . the only useable item from this entire toy were the colored pencils
1	i purchased this for my daughter a bit before christmas and she loves it . it is a great item for the price and does what the bigger brand names does . thank you
0	what a co-incidence , my first 3d puzzle too . average difficulty for the average user . would not recommend it for the beginner . the panels are not hard to put together , but it is fiddly putting all the panels together . once done , the model is quite magnifique . and got me started on 3d puzzles . hasbro/wrebbit should give everyone 1 free 3d puzzle , then everyone would get hooked on it . none of the 3d puzzles can stand a lot of handling , however this eiffel tower actually survived a show and tell . sadly it now rests in 3 pieces and i 'm too lazy to put it back together again . highly recommended
1	this shopping cart is the perfect height for my daughter . my two boys even love to use it to cart around their cars and blocks ! highly recommended
1	breyer makes such authentic lifelike replicas of the worlds most beautiful horses . my daughter is in horse heaven . the detail is so accurate that my daughter noticed even the footpad of the horses were unique to each one
1	i got this for my 5 year old , who started kindergarten this fall , and she is in love with the whole school concept . she loves to pretend to be the teacher with this playset . her friend came over one day and played with it , too , and they took turns being the student and teacher . i ended up buying another set for her friend 's birthday .
1	i do n't agree with the other review this doll is great to play with . she has such a pretty dress and vail . her hair is very long and it get tangled pretty easy but if your good with barbie hair its not a problem . i would suggest that you buy the groom at the same time take it from me i still really want him . the barbie with blond hair is also very pretty
1	ms. pac man was always my game back in the day . she just seemed less clunky than her male predecessor . i just received this game in the mail today and after a mad scramble for eight ( count 'em eight ) aa batteries i got down to business . i admit that i bought this game for ms. pac man , exclusively . here 's what i found , in a nutshell : pros : 1 ) graphics sound are faithful to the old arcade game with the minor exception of the placement of the score , lives and fruit . no problem . 2 ) old skool joystick . nice touch . 3 ) plug 'n play set-up . no brainer . cons : 1 ) i honestly do n't mind cords one bit . the eight batteries can be a bit of a logistical problem as i do n't usually have a dozen-or-so batteries lying around at any given time . 2 ) my main gripe is that the joystick is frustratingly unresponsive and has the habit of moving ms. pac in directions i do n't want her to go . i understand , however , that the previous version of this game was worse in this regard and has been slightly improved in this version . fair 'nuff . all-in-all a neat little contraption that is every bit as addictive as it was in my youth .
1	my son loves this game . when moving around the tracks , in the one game it can be difficult , the key is if you moving up or down , depending on which direction you need to go , push the joystick the direction once and let go , after that push the joystick the direction the train needs to go . i hope this helps . my son will be 3 in less then a month and it took him a week to figure out how to move around the tracks . mom , dad and sis had to play before that . the other games are a little easier , but i found the games educational and my son loves it
0	my 11 yr old thought this was amazing but the maneuver wheels on the bottom will only run over hard surfaces and not carpet which was ok with us . he did , however , run it over carpet and the traction wheel rubber pully snapped . the legs are also quite fragile and after only 2 days of play , one of the legs broke . because of that , the spider can not `` walk '' now ! too bad because its looks great . we are going to send it back .
0	anxiously awaited this very expensive box of cards mostly for the special insert cards but there was only the autograph card and no memorabilia card . you can not realize the disappointment one feels when this happens . you look and look , searching through the wrappers and identify each card hoping that you missed it somehow , but no . no memorabilia card as promised right on the box and in all advertised articles . of course , the topps company does n't have a website for me to complain to but this did turn out to be a surefire way to find another hobby ! thanks .
0	we used the machine once , and were disappointed by the performance . the second time that we attempted to use it , it would n't heat . after contacting roseart , i was told that i could ship it to them at my expense for a replacement . i will probably not bother , as it was a lousy product to begin with .
1	i love this nativity even though it i think it is pricey . there are no other ones like it . they are fisher price little people so you know they will hold up forever ! there are n't any other plastic nativity sets out there . get the set that plays the song when you place the angel on top of the stable . it is so worth the price when you know they will play with it every year . i even take this to church when i teach my 3and4yr old class about jesus birth . they love it
0	when we bought this , i liked the versatility it offered . i quickly noticed , however , that it is mostly good for strewing the soft pieces everywhere . there are actually too many pieces to keep up with , and frankly i 'm getting sick of stepping on the cow . my 6 mos old likes it for a couple minutes , until he 's rolled away from it . my 3 year old thinks it 's interesting , but she just ends up taking it apart and the pieces end up all over the place . after a couple days of playing with it i usually put most of it away and keep out only a couple parts to complement our other toys . the water play mat lasted until my 3 year old stepped on it once or twice . then that was gone
1	my nephew loves this gift . in fact , he would n't allow his sister to play with it , so now she also has one
1	my toddler and all of her friends love this play house . it is great , no assembly required
1	i purchased the parents magazine version first and my one year old son did n't play with it much but after watching him go crazy at a friends house with this hasbro toy i purchased it and he has been playing with it ever since . the buttons are placed in such a way that he can hold it with both hands and press buttons at the same time . he also enjoys teething on the keys . i highly recommend this product for mothers who want to hold on to their own keys
1	my kids grew up overseas and are quite familiar with renaissance paintings . they 've seen many of these paintings and are very familiar with them . i realize this is not the typical situation . i was disappointed that the game is basically a game of luck . it is not challenging or reinforcing of our kid 's knowledge . i had hoped for a game like `` famous authors '' which builds on and tests the level of knowledge of the players . nonetheless , the game is well presented . it 's on the expensive side , but the book alone is worth half the price . looking for a fancy gift with cultural overtones ? i recommend this
0	i have a big dora fan in my house this was one of her first dora dolls ( last year ) . she played with it for the first day or two ... its loud , very mechanical , not very appealing . the toy saw a rebirth in use when it was discovered that it she could make dora dance terrorize the puppy . the doll only does one dance , regardless of what skirt she has on now . from reading other reviews , if i pushed held it while she was wearing it she might ballet , but not worth the hassle ! since then , my dora lover has received various other dora dolls , so we have a collection that sings , dances , speaks various languages , and the only one she plays with regularly is the dress up adventure dora - she 's more posable , does something other than sing , and you can change her outfits . perfect for my almost 5 year old
0	i bought this identical bed at toys r us for $ 175.00 . this person is ripping people off , do your shopping before paying their mark up and shipping costs
0	i was very unhappy with this product because the paint is chipping off the wood side-boards which is very dangerous for kids . i was wondering if there was it possible for me to get new side boards for my grandson 's wagon which i purchased for his 2nd birthday . he is unable to play with the wagon because of the paint chipping off
1	my son got these blocks when he was 2 for christmas . he is now 4 and 1/2 and still playing with them . it seems no matter what new toy he has gotten , every morning i hear him carrying out his bucket of these megabloks . i only wish they came is a larger quantity .
1	love it ! the questions are great ... the `` party mode '' is great entertainment
1	two grandsons ( 4 years and 6 years ) have truly enjoyed this cartridge . recommend it highly !
1	i bought this set for my three children 5,4,2 last christmas at a fancy toy store . this product is top of the line and my kids can not get enough of this . the marble runs are easy to build , sturdy and so much for them to play with . there are a variety to build with the more advanced sets also we bought a few more `` fun '' and cool looking marbles as they raced them down . the kids can change out the different blocks to make the marbles react in different ways- which is a creative aspect . i love this toy ! ! ! ! my kids beg me to make them a new marble run all the time . you do need a hard surface to build on , since we did n't have a `` train table '' we put it on a hard piece of cardboard so it laid flat on the carpet , that way you do n't have to hear the clink-clink of the marbles as they hit the bottom..
1	fisher-price is bringing back old time well-made toy construction with their peek a blocks ! i have 4 kids who are 5 and under , and i have to say that they all get use out of these blocks ! if you love peek a blocks , please feel free to join my peek a blocks group at yahoo groups : http : //groups.yahoo.com/group/fisherpricepeekablocks/ it is completely free and we have been having some interesting discussions on there about unknown secrets of peek a blocks !
0	i recieved this itema s a gift . i thought it would be great i was wrong ! the designs it gives you are really cool but the ploish that comes with this is awful ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1	her favorite toy ... she loves the microphone ... keys light up to prompt her to press the keys and play a song ... . this thing is great
1	i purchased this for my son @ babies r us only because i had a gift card ... but i dont regret it at all ... this is one of kristobals ' favorite toys from the peek a block collection ! my oldest son enjoys it also ! not bad for 20bu
0	i bought this as a christmas present for my 4-year-old daughter . she is a huge my little pony fan . ponyville lives in our house in fact . we got it out and played with it for a couple hours . we did n't have the problems described with the hand crank . that seems to be very durable . the problem is with the flower that zippee goes in . a pony steps on the flower to open the flower and then you wind the gear counter clockwise to close it . after a couple hours , the flower petals are now broken and ca n't be repaired . toys certainly do n't have the quality in them that they used to . hasbro 's quality in general has declined . this was demonstrated in the newest my little pony castle as well . this toy has some neat features . the crank works well and the braiding mechanism is useful . the breezie that lives in the flower goes along with the story in the my little pony video series . the colors are vivid and bright . i would have liked to suggest that the pink stage that the daffidazey stands on should have had built-in storage to hold the hair accessories . some additional clips would also have been a nice addition to this set . 4 clips for a set that is designed to do all your ponies ' hair is a bit skimpy . the braids are nice and tight and even a young child can operate this toy ... .with a bit of assistance . ( hint : putting suction cups or velcro hook and loop on the bottom makes it even easier for little ones to play with minimal adult assistance )
0	my 4 year son is learning about the fragility of life the hard way with this tank . two goldfish , two flushes . if i take the struggling fish out of the tank and put it in a fish bowl it seems to come around , but they wo n't last 24 hours in this tank . i 've followed the directions to a t , adjusted the ph , tried lights on lights off , pump on pump off , even used bottled water , but the fish just do a slow fade when in the tank
0	this toy was a huge disappointment for me . my boys took one look at it and threw it . i thought it was much bigger than what it is . i was also upset that i spent as much as i did and it was n't even a decent size . my boys are moving to a car themed room and it just was n't what i envisioned . it also only says one thing which can be quite boring for small children
0	my 3 year old has 8 vsmile games and this is his least favorite . his top 2 favorite is toy story and winnie the pooh
0	i was very disappointed with the quality of this product . i had to request a second kit because the scented oils bottles were empty in the first kit . the second kit also had the same problem . both kits had to be returned . it is difficult to determine how fun this kit would be when it is missing items within the kit
1	ok so my son got it for christmas and here it is june and i just hooked it up . it took me all of 5 mintutes not even that to program it . the first try # 4 wouldnt take so what i did is i put the toy remote on one thigh and the remote on the other so that there were almost touching and so that the `` eyes '' were right on top of each other . and it took straight away . its really fun for my 4 year old my 10 year old got bored . my only suggestion is that there needs to be a bigger choice of games . they are so similar that my 4 year old changes games quite a bit . i am actually having trouble finding games for it now . its great and if they are going to be in front of the tv might as well be learning . he also hase vsmile which is a little bit better if you can afford the 60 $ for the game unit and 20 $ for the games . ( grandma and grandpa got ours for us with games ) so it wasnt bad for us . read with me dvd is good though , i really enjoy playing it and listening to the stories
1	our family played this game a lot during the 60 's . we had a blast with it . i did n't think much about it until this year when my son turned 6 . it 's a blast for family fun
1	there are always problems with an any type of bed , even an inflatable one . i am actually 21 , but i do n't have a credit card so i had to use the kid review instead . this bed is great . of course there are problems , but they do n't outweigh the good that the bed has . it is great to sleep on , you can carry it on trips , you can have it on another bed that is in one place , or on the floor . i do admit , it is somewhat hard to set up , but it is worth the effort , for the sleep is unparralleled . i sleep on it every night and i have had no problems with it at all . i recomend this bed to be for ages 5 to adult because of the gap it has between the side and the mattress . what is the most important thing of all is this : is the person you bought it for happy with it
0	there is no magic in this wand . what appeared to be a thin wooden malfoy 's wand , turned out to be a poor replica made of plastic . my son was very disappointed . he used his own hard earned money to purchase this item
0	i thought this toy looked fantastic as i was searching for developmental toys to help in various areas while they grew . the versitility of this one looks great . well , i liked it more than either one of my children did , as they almost never played with it except for the simple joy of taking it apart and strewing it all over the playroom ! the black and white face was good when they are first starting to be attracted to faces but other than that , it just got taken apart and lost its interest , no matter which way i arranged the peices . infants would do much better with a flat playmat with a mobile suspended above their heads
1	my son received these when he was 7 months old and we are loving them ! they 're adorable and chunky and work great on carpets or hard floors . they 're easy for little hands to hold on to and a couple of them rattle . when my nephews come over they always find these -- and they 're 5 and 7
1	i got this for my 2 year old for christmas . it was a nice present , he enjoys it . 2 things though , it only came with 75 smaller balls so i had to purchase another 100 from somewhere else and the picture is misleading as to how big the item actually is . it could fit 2 toddlers in the pit itself and that would be max , and that is two 2-3 year olds . it is comparable though to other ball pits in size and he seems to enjoy the hoop and putting the ball through the hole in big bird 's ice cream cone so i feel it was worth the money , especially since i did n't pay for shipping
0	i bought two of these trikes for my 19 month old twin sons . within the first 10 minutes of use , they both tipped over numerous times . they tipped over when they were trying to use the pedals and also when they were just using their feet on the floor . definitely not a sturdy trike . my husband and i were very disappointed and returned them immediately . in reading other reviews , i see that our experience with these trikes is not unique
0	i bought this for my 6 year old after christmas as her cousin received one and loved it . i ran all over town trying to find the pvd 's ( which are hard to find a good selection of ) . i ended up purchasing some online . by the time the pvd 's arrived , the player was no longer working . we have replaced the batteries several times . on a rare occasion , it will turn on , but that is very rare . we are very disappointed with this unit . i should have listened to my husband and bought the dvd player !
0	this suduko handheld game was not user friendly . i returned it for a full refund
1	my 28 month old son got this puzzle for christmas and loves it . he put it together the first time out of the box himself . it is the first thing he does every morning and then several times a day . my almost 5 year old likes it too . it is not as sturdy as the melissa doug floor puzzles , but it still really sturdy .
0	my daughter wanted this for christmas more than anything . but the doll is very difficult to use . suzie has these sudden shutdowns where she turns off for no apparent reason . then suddenly she 'll come back to life later . she `` grows '' almost instantly . despite my best efforts to try and protect the grow button . i reset her constantly . getting her to do all of the fun `` big girl '' things she is suppossed to do is frustrating for my five year old . essentially , i have spent more time fiddling with suzie than my daughter has spent playing with her . and the face paint came off almost immediately . even with the small amount of time that she has been working . perhaps when my daugter is a little older , she can spend time fiddling with her . she does play with her as just a `` baby doll '' so it has n't been a total waste . but i certainly did n't need to spend the extra money for all of the electronics that do n't work . oh , and sometimes i 'll walk into my daughters room and she 'll suddenly `` wake up '' and start saying mama . very horror movieish .
1	i loved this trike ! it was given to my son for his first birthday and he loved it . daycare was in walking distance ( i lived in the city ) and i used the trike to take him . my son loved to hold onto the handle bars , it gave him a sence of freedom from the stroller that he hated . my son is now three years old and i am buying a new one for my one year old . i understand some people give this product bad reviews but there is a 1-800 number that goes with the toy . the brand radio flyer is well known and the customer service line is very helpful and willing to replace parts or defects . this is the only gift that was given to my son that i can say `` i love '' and have had for more than just one year ! enjoy
1	my son is a very active 2 yr old and very hard on toys , and these are great . thick plastic construction . easy enough for him to hook them up himself . we have 2 different kinds and they are both super
1	if your child likes the wiggles like my 2 year-old does , then she 'll love this keyboard . except that there is no volume button , which i consider rude to the parents . :
0	my 3 yr old son received this toy last year for christmas and was so excited . in less than a week , one of the rear wheels cracked in half , rendering it a non-returnable piece of junk
1	i bought her and veronica too ! i love to them ! ! i play archie and date them..they are my fun girls ! ! my wife likes them too
0	we got this set for my 4 year old son for christmas . his eyes lit up when he saw it . he dropped everything and insisted that we open it right away ... .we did n't , of course ... we waited a whole day ... thank goodness ... it literally took an hour to put together . there are so many pieces that look alike but are barely different . it was very frustrating ... then it would n't stay together once it was finished . it has been nothing but a frustration for him and me ever since . he gets so upset when he tries to play with it . we saved the box . it 's going back , if they will take it ...
0	big disappointment . cheaply made . t-rex model does not snap together , can not even fit together as parts are improperly molded . microscope less functional than a magnifying lens . volcano is ok , the plaster does work , but you must provide ingredients for the eruption . weather center very very flimsy and breaks . i was quite surprised a name like smithsonian would be associated with this low of quality in a product . supplies for crystals subpar for what is required . was an enormous disapointment after the holidays for my sons .
0	it makes cotton candy in 30 minutes because it has to warm for 10 minutes then it have to put put the suger in the middle then wait til becomes webby then wait agian to turn it off . parents this machine dose n't work only made with suger thats all it is and also it takes forever ? think before you buy your children will get cavities you will also spend your money on this instead of food or other need
1	i 've been wanting this forever and when i got it , it was totally awsome ! ! first it comes with a really , really cool chair ( that you are going to love ! ) , it also comes with a sweet guitar with amp ( fyi . the amp has some really cool stickers on it ) and it also includes two ( 2 ) guitar magazines . i truly love this piece mainly because i 've always wanted an amp for my guitars . oh , i highly , highly recommend this you 'll love it ! well hope this helps . : )
0	good luck getting this bed ! i ordered it 5 months ago ( with availability being 2-4 weeks . each month i was told it will available `` next month . '' i finally cancelled my order and purchased the little tykes one before my frustrated 3 yr. old outgrows a toddler bed . kidkraft needs to focus more on actually manufacturing their products and less on marketing for orders they are unable to fulfill
0	we were excited to give this to our 5 year old for his birthday . after opening he loved the design and having his own cool looking notebook computer and was very excitied . however the screen is very disappointing . i ca n't even rate the games because overall i simply just ca n't see what is on it . the product is relatively useless in a dark environment and dissapointing . i should have gone to a toys r us and actually compared the product to other simular products . i would suggest anyone do the same prior to buying it
1	my family loves this game because there are several different games you can play with it and it goes along with the book , so the kids like to compare it.this product is very durable and will last
1	this toy is a wonderful first toy . it captures their attention and has all kinds of handles for them to grab when they 're ready ! i absolutely love it , and so does my son
1	someone gave these to us when my son was 9 months old . he loved holding them and it has been fun watching him learn to `` color '' and develop his hand-eye coordination . he is now 22 months old and we 've just used them up and i had to buy the crayola tub crayons because i could n't find these at toys r us . the crayola crayons are thinner ( which does n't hold up as well to toddler abuse ) and have more colors , but i like these better because they come with the ducky sponge to wash the crayon off the walls ( my son loves that part , too ) . these crayons are a surefire way to get my son into the bathtub
0	it seems like a nice complete set of playfood , except that the boxes are really flimsy cardboard , and i 've thrown most of them out already . it does n't take much to crush them . there are much nicer sets out there , and there are separate pieces sold on ebay , that are probably used but will stand the test of your kids much better . not worth the money
1	very interesting spoof of the original game . i found the first one boring after a few plays , but this one still interests my kids and i after 10+ plays . it 's a bit convoluted to put it together initially , but well worth it
0	this is a great starter deck for any duelist . with just a few booster packs this deck will become unstopable ! after only a few days of practice with this deck i had beaten all of my friends who had been dueling for months .
0	i would n't even give this toy one star if i was n't forced to . mattel should be ashamed of themselves for putting out a product with 1980 's graphics and even worse sound . it sounds like my husband 's 1985 casio watch . the only thing they did well with this product is market it . i gave this to my daughter from santa and i am still going to return it .
1	even though i 'm convinced that all monitors work differently in different locations , this model has treated us well . we got this monitor ( with dual receivers ) for my first daughter 3 1/2 years ago and it was always clear crisp . reception was perfect in the basement , in the frontyard , in the backyard ... even at the neighbor 's house . one of the receivers konked out after about 2 years but we survived with only one . the second receiver finally stopped working last week after doing waaaaayyyy too much internet research , i decided to go with the same , trusty , inexpensive monitor and it works great ! i 've never slept with a monitor in our room ( because our babies stay with us for a long time ) so i do n't know about nighttime quirks . i keep the monitor in our kitchen area to listen for the little one waking up from naps ... .and to spy on the girls when they play upstairs without me . : ) baby # 3 is on the way i 'm sure this monitor will last another 3 years until we do n't need it anymore . so , $ 40 over the course of 3 children is n't bad !
1	we received boggle jr as a gift at christmas . my daughter is almost four and absolutely loves this game . she is learning her words and is learning to spell . this is a wonderful game for learning picture recognition and verbalization and moving on to spelling three and four letter words . i told my sister and she requested it for her son . he 's a happy camper with the game , too
0	my son loved the idea of this toy and was so excited to receive it as a birthday gift . however one club broke almost immediately and the other broke shortly after that . it is poor quality and construction . do n't use it unless your kids are the gentle kind . most kids would break this the first time . [ ...
0	this item came in the mail and my 4 year old son and i were very excited . i guess we should have read the description more carefully because i was n't expecting so many tiny little pieces . we used ticky tack and began the tedious process of sticking the different sized stars and such all over his room . we waited that night to see the glowing celestial extravaganza . we kept the light on for some time to 'charge ' the glow in the dark element then turned off the light . what we found was nothing close to amazing . the glow was fairly dim and only lasted for a very short period of time . we even turned a blacklight on them and all that did was make them glow a little brighter but , again , the glow only lasted about 10 -15 minutes . i ended up going back online and buying glow in the dark paint and a star shaped sponge . we dabbed stars all over his ceiling . these glowing stars last most of the night and our friends and family think his room is really cool
1	okay , we all know about the disney cars craze and trying to hunt down all the new die-cast characters mattel puts out . these 1:24 scale models are very , very nice and the size is perfect for young boys , girls or collectors . the only downside is that they only made mater and mcqueen . who would n't love to see chick hicks or the king in 1:24 scale ? ! come on mattel ! get with it ! ! ;
0	this thing is a waste of time effort and money . it falls apart the minute the child tries to swing the baby , not to mention it is too small for a two tear old to play with
1	we learned about these blocks years ago when my now 13 year old was in pre-school . i was amazed at how these seemingly simple pieces of wood , so totally enraptured these little kids ! kapla , are 'blocks ' that are all exactly the same size . at first glance , they seem boring . but once you start playing with them , they are so much more . they can be made into all kinds of structures , and can even be raised higher than one can reach , without falling ! ! when our 'surprise blessing ' turned 2 , i pulled them out for him . he enjoyed them ( though at 3 he likes them much more ) , but what surprised me is that my older two ( 15 and 13 ) love playing with them as well ! ! in fact , we all do ! ! i know it seems like a lot of money to spend on these , but they are more than worth it !
0	my daughter got this for christmas this year and almost immediately pulled off the top half of the greg character on the keyboard . in their defense , none of the other characters have come off so we will try to return this in case it was an isolated incident . other than that , she seems to like it . she also received the accordian and loves it so i would recommend that over the keyboard
1	the wagon is great , as expected . 5 stars for the wagon , no stars for delivery . it arrived with a dent , though , and when we called they told us a replacement would n't be available until mid-february , plus we 'd have to figure out how to re-pack the thing , which was halfway assembled before we noticed the dent . . . so we gently banged it out and spray-painted the spot , and the recipients probably wo n't care , but it was a pain-in-the-butt , and there did n't seem any way to deal with it that would n't have been too much trouble .
0	just received one for my son 's birthday . he loves it as he has a laptop like daddy . the quality is terrible , like another user 's experience the right side of the device does n't work properly and this is brand new . apparently the sensors on the device do n't line up properly with the go circles or volume icons on pages with them on the right side . i ca n't exchange it as i am not in the us so we can only play with half a book unless we experiment with finding where the right side sensors actually are . this of course is very frustrating to a 3 yr old as it really messes up alot of stuff . also the type of pencil seems rally sharp and brittle for a 4 yr old . ps the box says for 4-8 yr olds vs amazons text of less than 4 by the manufacturer
1	i like the language tutor and the music stuff ! i also like the screen savers ! it 's given me great ideas ! i play with it in a different way than you are supposed to . like if i need a story starter i go to the `` magic act '' and read the sentences for an idea
1	we bought this toy for our 1 year old son . it is very sturdy and well made and the blocks inside are great . i agree with the other reviews that the wagon moves to fast on wood floors and it does not turn well . my biggest compaint , however , is that when both lids are closed , the wagon looks just like a 2-step ladder . our son constantly tries to climb it , like stairs . the other day , he finally stood up on top of the wagon and the wagon tipped straight over onto the handle . my son fell over with it and crashed on his face . there are two rubber stoppers on the back of the wagon , but they do not prevent it from falling over . my son is fine , but this toy is very dangerous and i do not recommend it !
1	i am confused by the poor reviews of this product . my daughter received this toy from the easter bunny this year and the whole family plus grandparents/aunts/uncles etc . have had a ball with it . it creates huge bubbles round or long , that float in the air for quite a bit of time . i do agree that the solution runs out very quickly and it is too hard for a three year old to work ... but for the price i have to say this toy is well worth it ! we also made our own solution ( granny 's recipe ) and it worked ... very messy and sudsy though . i would recommend this product to anyone who loves bubbles
0	the stars may be really nice , but the package i received looked already open . the 3 sheets with stickers appeared as if someone soaked them in water and the package was missing the putty to stick up the bigger plastic stars .
0	swing comes out of base every time you try to put the baby doll in it and i bought the exact baby for it . the educational value of 3 stars is for me , you get what you pay for most of the time
0	this is a piece of garbage . the balls deflate after a couple hours . the rim is so frail it wo n't hold up to much . my friend came over and yelled slam dunk threateningly at my hoop at which point i got in between them and the hoop and said this hoop was not for slam dunking . they correctly pointed out that it says `` slam dunk challenge '' right on the back board . do n't do it - it will break . when i turned it on it kept score wrong and gave points for misses . so that function is worthless . the only reason i gave it two stars is that it looks kind of cool but will have to find a nerf ball .
0	this jack in the box is pretty flimsy . not worth the price . would have returned it but it would have not been worth the expense .
1	my three children are huge fans of melissa and doug puzzles and with as many as we own we sure needed a way to store them neatly . being an organization freak myself , i was in search of the perfect storage case . not only did it need to hold many puzzles , but it needed to be made well and look nice too . melissa and doug to the rescue - once again ! we purchased the same storage case in natural and it 's been a life saver in our toy room - it makes it easy for them to put the puzzles away without them losing pieces anymore . you might find it hard to spend $ 30 on an empty storage case so i suggest looking for the storage case that comes with six puzzles for $ 60 instead . more for your money ! in our case , we own so many puzzles that we did n't need anymore and especially duplicates of what we already have
1	we bought this pool toy for our daughter , and she was thrilled ! ! ! but after being on this toy one time we now call him the bucking bull . good luck staying on the silly thing . now my child sits and hangs on to the handles and we pull her around the pool on it . my husband and i can not stay on this thing either . every now and then we bail on with sheer determination , only to be off in a matter of seconds
0	i bought this toy along with mr . incredible for my son 's birthday . he loves the movie and was very excited to get these toys . unfortanitly , they lasted all of five minutes before syndromes head fell off , and mr. incredibles hand broke off . after that i had to deal with a crying kid . if you want the toy just to look at , then it is good , but if you buy it for your child , do n't expect it to last long
0	whatver your favorite fruit may be , this game will certinaly not be in your cadre of favorite games . it is basically boring , and ill-conceived . i have played it a few times with my kids , and found it to be of no particular interest on any level-it is neither fun , exciting or challenging , for them or me . i strongly recommend you try a cranium game , or how about chess ? ? ? the only positve thing i can think of with regard to this widly overrated game , is that it 's better than tv , which is n't saying much
0	i purchased this for my 8 year old for christmas and thought i would be able to store more than just a few songs , but the memory capacity is actually only 109m and will actually only hold about 8-10 songs , no where near the 2 hours promised . i would not recommend this purhcase to any child
1	just wanted to let others know this info that i found out after reading the tip given by the reviewer about getting the table for a lot cheaper at costco ... i called costco and they carried the kidkraft art table with two stools back in january of 2006 , and will no longer be carrying it . you can find it at walmart for $ 66 plus shipping , just check the website . the table is not the same however -- the dimensions are different , the sides of the tables is slightly different ( on one side of the kidcraft table has two cups and a mesh basket in between the two cups , and the other side has a space where little legos can snap onto ) . the stools are also tiny compared to the ones that come with this table . overall it looks a little less substantial , but since i have n't seen it in person , i really ca n't give my opinion . hope that helps someone
0	i bought this for my 2 yr old daughter . i was so surprised at the quality for little tykes . it has no storage and the refridgerator door would not stay closed . i think it should cost half of what it does . i purchased the step two kitchen when my daughter was three , and it is way better by far
1	i am the star wars fanatic i really like this toy ! it has firing misiles and stickers to put on the vehicle . and , you can open the wings ! this is a great toy !
1	this is the best game for the beach and the car . the little letters clip right into the board . it has a zipper case also . it 's great and we enjoy it very much
0	this was purchased for my 2 yr old son who loved to draw and scribble . he was so excited to see thomas riding the track - well it worked the day we opened it and never again ! i would recommend not spending the money on this one and get the regular aquadoodle for 1/2 the price ! you are not able to wash the mat so if you get anything on it ( eg . crayon or dirt ) you ca n't get it out .
0	i was so excited when i ordered my star wars holographic emperor figure . i 'd been waiting for this exclusive figure be available for weeks ! ! when i got home today , the box with the amazon logo was on my doorstep . upon opening the box , i was completely disappointed to find that the emperor figure i 'd been waiting for was damaged since it was jammed into the box so that the backing card was crushed . the people packing this stuff are half-wits ! ! anybody with a brain would know better than to cram something into a box like that ! ! they should be ashamed of their service to all you collectors out there ... .beware ! !
0	my son kept seeing the commercials for this doll and he wanted it so badly . talked about it for a month so we got it for him . he was super excited when he got and and the thing did n't work . it just randomly gives clues that confused my son the point of tears . he was so confused it would tell him that he was close to it , then say he was no where near it . then when he was standing next to it , it said he was no where near it . he was so disappointed . he thought the toy would be able to play hide n seek with him . we followed the directs and helped him play with it . he 's 4 . ( he was n't running around like crazy like another person mentioned was why it does n't work for some kids . ) i think this is a terrible toy and hayley 's now in the trash . she 's too cheap and junky looking to even save for my daughter as a regular doll to play with
1	my son received this as a christmas gift , and thoroughly enjoys it . this is not a regular dvd . it is designed to go with the `` read with me dvd '' system ( a separate remote control that works with it on your tv ) . a previous reviewer was not aware of this , so it should not have received a bad review for consumer error
1	i enjoy seeing my twin four year old son 's play with the read with me dvd program and cd 's . the children are learning as they play . i see them recalling information and reviewing parts of the story . this educational toy is very engaging . the only problem i have with this toy is sometimes if the child is not on level with the dvd player it takes several tries to get the dvd player to respond to the remote .
1	my two year old boy absolutely loves these puzzles . they 're soft but sturdy and are more challenging than peg puzzles . it 's a great puzzle for kids that can do more than peg puzzles but are n't ready for the regular 10 piece interlocking puzzles . there 's a base template for each puzzle to help put it together or you can remove it for a bigger challenge . the only downside are some of the very small pieces ... definitely need parental supervision for kids under 3
1	i 've heard no complaints from either one , it 's a hit
0	please . these things suck . oh , wow ! its got a 3 inch screen ! ! big deal ! my portable dvd player is 10.2 inches ; almost tripple the size of this ! the quality is pixely and crap , and you have to buy the stupid `` video now '' pvds . $ 14 for , what ? 6 episodes ? oh , thats so cool , as in not really . trust me people . stick to portably dvd player . yes , they are very expensive , but they will last twice as long . if you want a really good dvd player , buy the 10.2 inch insigna portable dvd . yeah , its $ 260 , but it is worth every penny . so , all in , if you are gulliable , and like blowing your money on a device that is better left in the store , buy this ! but , if you are like me , stick to dvd players .
0	i 'm sorry no as a matter of fact i am not sorry this doll looks like she can be in three six mafia video dancing in the background . who told mattel that this was a good idea ? is this mattel 's vein attempt to give the dolls an `` urban '' feel if mattel feels this is appropriate to teach young girls to dress like ho 's and teach them that their body is all that they have to offer then mattel has some messed up views of the world . honestly people this doll is not innocent looking it looks like it could be on that hbo documentary about hookers . what happened to the times when a kid could be a kid and play with a normal looking doll .
1	i bought this bed for my two year old because he got too big for his crib . he moves around a lot in his sleep so i wanted a safe first bed for him . he absolutely loves this bed and actually he is sleeping much better now than he was before . the only problem was that the mattress and box spring we bought were too high , so we just use the mattress for now . eventually we 'll put the box spring back in .
0	for the most part this is a good toy . it was actually one of the easier items i took out of a box this week : ) my daughter ( 4 ) loves it and as long as you can tolerate the `` mommy/daddy the wing fell off can you put it back on ? '' every 5-10 minutes then it really is good . i guess if your child is old enough and has the dexterity to put the wings back on by herself this toy would be great
0	with five kids under the age of 9 and four leapsters in the house , there is rarely a time when someone is n't playing one ( if not all ! ) of them . we have about 10 of the cartridges , and this was the most disappointing ( followed closely by spiderman ) . there simply is n't enough for them to do with it . the beauty of the leapster is the ability to interact with the games , and learn while they do it . watching a video on a 2 inch screen just does n't cut it .
