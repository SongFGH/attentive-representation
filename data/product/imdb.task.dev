1	if you  " get it "  ,  it's magnificent .   if you don't ,  it's decent .   please understand that  " getting it "  does not necessarily mean you've gone through a school shooting .  there is so much more to this movie that ,  at times ,  the school shooting becomes insignificant .   above all ,  it's a movie about acceptance ,  both superficially--of a traumatic event ,  but also of people who are different for whatever reason .   it's also a movie about unendurable pain ,  and how different people endure it .  in this case ,  the contrast between alicia's rage and deanna's obsession creates an atmosphere of such palpable anxiety that halfway through the movie we wonder how the director could possibly pull a happy ending out of his hat .  thankfully ,  the audience is given credit for being human beings ;  our intelligence is not insulted by a sappy ,  implausibly moralistic ending .   above and beyond that ,  i try to keep a clear head about movies being fiction and all that .  yet i must admit ,  i cried like a lost little baby during this movie .  there were certain things about it that hit *very* close to home and opened up some old wounds that never quite healed .  but that is not necessarily a bad thing . 
1	   " burning paradise "  is a combination of neo-shaw brothers action and ringo lam's urban cynicism .  when one watches the film ,  they might feel the fight scenes are only mediocre in nature but that doesn't matter ,  it's attitude and atmosphere that counts .  this great film has both !  !  always trying to be different than his contemporaries ,  lam gives us to traditional heroes ( fong sai-yuk and hung shi-kwan ) and puts them in a  " raiders of the lost ark "  setting .  however ,  these are not the light-hearted comedic incarnations that you might see in a jet li movie .  instead these guys fight to the death with brutal results .  what makes the film even better is that anyone could die at anytime ,  there is no holding back .  too bad ,  they don't make films like this more often . 
1	this is definitely an appropriate update for the original ,  except that  " party on the left is now party on the right .  "  like the original ,  this movie rails against a federal government which oversteps its bounds with regards to personal liberty .  it is a warning of how tenuous our political liberties are in an era of an over-zealous ,  and over-powerful federal government .  kowalski serves as a metaphor for waco and ruby ridge ,  where the us government ,  with the cooperation of the mainstream media ,  threw around words like  " white supremacist "  and  " right wing extremists as well as trumped-up drug charges to abridge the most fundamental of its' citizens rights ,  with the willing acquiescence of the general populace .  that message is so non-pc ,  i am stunned that this film could be made - at least not without bringing the federal government via the irs down on the makers like they did to juanita broderick ,  katherine prudhomme ,  the western journalism center ,  and countless others who dared to speak out .   " live free or die "  is the motto on jason priestly's hat as he brilliantly portrays  " the voice ,  "  and that sums up the dangerous  ( to some )  message of this film .   
1	i love ghost stories in general ,  but i particularly love chilly ,  atmospheric and elegantly creepy british period-style ghost stories .  this one qualifies on all counts .  a naive young lawyer  (  " solicitor "  in britspeak )  is sent to a small village near the seaside to settle an elderly ,  deceased woman's estate .  it's the 1920s ,  a time when many middle-class brits go to the seaside on vacation for  " their health .  "  well ,  guess what ,  there's nothing  " healthy "  about the village of crythin gifford ,  the creepy site of the elderly woman's hulking ,  brooding victorian estate ,  which is located on the fringes of a fog-swathed salt marsh .  when the lawyer saves the life of a small girl  ( none of the locals will help the endangered tot -- you find out why later on in the film )  ,  he inadvertently incurs the wrath of a malevolent spirit ,  the woman in black .  she is no filmy ,  gauzy wraith ,  but a solid black silhouette of malice and evil .  the viewer only sees her a few times ,  but you feel her malevolent presence in every frame .  as the camera creeps up on the lawyer while he's reading through legal papers ,  you expect to see the woman in black at any moment .  when the lawyer goes out to the generator shed to turn on the electricity for the creepy old house ,  the camera snakes in on him and you think she'll pop up there ,  too .  waiting for the woman in black to show up is nail-bitingly suspenseful .  we've seen many elements of this story before ( the locked room that no one enters ,  the fog ,  the naive outsider who ignores the locals' warnings )  but the director somehow manages to combine them all into a completely new-seeming and compelling ghost story .  watch it with a buddy so you can have someone warm to grab onto while waiting for the woman in black .   .   . 
1	daniel day lewis in my left foot gives us one of the best performances ever by an actor .  he is brilliant as christy brown ,  a man who has cerebral palsy ,  who then learned to write and paint with his left foot .  a well deserved oscar for him and brenda fricker who plays his loving mother .  hugh o'conner is terrific as the younger christy brown and ray mcanally is great as the father .  worth watching for the outstanding performances . 
1	personal taste rules when it comes to talking about movies such as this treasured little gem .  way back in the eighties ,  the early eighties ,  i discovered this movie ,  like so many released at the time ,   " night patrol "   " bad manners "  or even  " king frat "  the artwork and blurbs on the back of the covers tempted and teased you .   of course being of an age ,  movies like that i have already mentioned as well as stuff like  " screwballs "  and the many others ,  captured the imagination ,  and thankfully many years later i still remember some with fondness and some with disdain the many movies that help maintain my love of such genre as parodies or pastiches .   made many years after the huge success of  " animal house "  and having seen how it had fared down through the years ,  i now know that there would be no way this movie would ever eclipse the box office bucks obtain aforementioned nor would it linger in the memory ,  much like that of national lampoon's vacation .   to be honest ,  not everything that has carried the national lampoon logo has been a wild success ,  however to me class reunion remains one of my all time favourite movies ,  with instantly recognisable characters ,  such as the aloof bob spinnaker played to perfection by gerrit graham ,  so good in charles band's  " terrorvision "  still lingering in the past glories of his youth .  or how about stephen furst's brash and ballsy turn as the high school lazy drunken sex crazed bum hubert downs .   sweet as .  which makes me ponder .  as i already said ,  personal taste not withstanding .  people can be so cruel ,  so it will never win any awards or be compared to the like of its's peers within the comedy world .  it does have some merit .  being one of the earlier scripts penned by john hughes ,  who would later go on to do one of my own favourites of his work  " weird science "  as well as having a wonderful theme title sung by the great gary u . s bonds .   what more can i say ,  it's a movie just waiting to be rediscovered ,  time and time again . 
1	this indie film looks at the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class in connecticut .  the plot is fairly thin .  what drives the film is the characters ,  excellently played by mostly unknown actors .  standouts in the cast are brewster as a high school teacher experiencing marital problems and weixler as a casino dealer who moonlights as a stripper .  the two actresses give natural performances and work well together .  this is an impressive feature film debut for writer schechter and director setton .  the latter keeps the narrative moving at a fast clip .  the film title and poster suggest something raunchy ,  but this is a marvelous little comedy-drama . 
1	panic delivers the goods ten fold with oscar caliber performances from william h macy ,  neve campbell ,  and donald sutherland .  in a movie about the choices we make and the consequences we live with .  chillingly honest and thought provoking ,  panic is easily one of the best film to come out of hollywood in years .  the impact stays with you right after you leave the theater . 
1	one of the great classic comedies .  not a slapstick comedy ,  not a heavy drama .  a fun ,  satirical film ,  a buyers beware guide to a new home .   filled with great characters all of whom ,  cary grant is convinced ,  are out to fleece him in the building of a dream home .   a great look at life in the late 40's .   
1	when i found the movie in the schedule for christmas ,  its title did not sound familiar to me since i have not read the novel and had not heard anything about the film .  yet ,  having read the content ,  i decided to spend my christmas evening on watching the movie .  the effect surprised me totally :  i do not remember when i last saw a film in which every single moment involved me .  a vow to cherish is ,  without any doubt ,  one of the movies that now constitutes a real surprise i have received from cinema .  here are some arguments of mine why i consider this film a highly underrated piece of good cinema .    first ,  the entire content is particularly educational .  it has something to offer to the modern audience - pure right faith and some answers for the universal questions .  is there a need for christ in our times ?  does love still matter ?  what for is there faith ?  what is the logics of burden and suffering in life ?  is there really someone by my side i can always trust ?  the movie provides the answers through the content since all that happens to the characters may as well happen to any of us .   second ,  the movie is exceptionally humane .  the main characters experience inner struggles and cope with extremely hard decisions .  is it better for kyle david denman )  and teri  ( megan paul )  to start their own lives and forget about the family or retain the values they were taught at home ?  is it better for john  ( ken howard )  to leave ellen  ( barbara babcock )  ,  his sick wife ,  and start a new happy life with julia  ( donna bullock )  ,  a woman he falls in love with ?  in fact ,  ellen no longer recognizes him .  .  .  yet ,  he decides to vow his wife eternal fidelity .  had john's rebellious brother ,  phil  ( d .  david morin )  ,  better go on his easy life although it does not bring him satisfaction or once start to think seriously of his life .  phil's prayer to god in the park is a psychological masterwork of universal aspect of humanity .  these words could be as well said by everybody no matter of where ,  when or how they live .   third ,  the movie is a great portrayal of family ,  not very popular nowadays :  there are problems ,  yet ,  there is always something more powerful that gets these people together .  this  " something "  is love and trust .  i know that it may seem a bit idealistic .  not all families can rely on fidelity and it may not be as simple as that .  nevertheless ,  it is a very educational aspect and a realistic one .   fourth ,  the entire film focuses on people's mutual help .  if we want to live happy lives in our society ,  we must understand one thing :  we have to help one another .  alexander  ( ossie davis )  is an example of such attitude .  at the beginning of the movie ,  we see him talk to john about praying .  later ,  he helps his brother .  alexander is a kinda  " angel "  that is sent to john and his family .  isn't it possible that we may become angels to one another ?   fifth ,  the artistic features are also worth attention .  performances :  barbara babcock gives an authentic performance as ellen and although she has a difficult role ,  she does a perfect job .  consider ,  for instance ,  the moment she appears at school and badly wants to teach again .  ken howard is also memorable as the faithful husband .  picture :  the most memorable for me was the scene of john and ellen in the park walking on the fallen leaves  ( autumn )  while the sunshine  ( love )  spreads everywhere .  i interpreted as a sort of symbol :  even if there is sorrow ,  this can always be illuminated by light and joy .  .  .   a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie that realistically showed to me what it means to love ,  what fidelity is as well it once again proved to me how beautiful it is to live and believe .  at the end ,  i would like to quote the profound words from the movie i found very touching and hope you will also do   kyle to his uncle phil :  yes ,  he  ( john brighton )  lives according to the bible .  but nobody forces you to do so .  yet ,  according to what rules do you live ? 
0	i have never seen a movie as bad as this .  it is meant to be a  " fun "  movie ,  but the only joke is at the start ,  and it is not funny .  if you like this sort of movie ,  then you may just be able to give it a vote of 2 .  if it had the necessary votes ,  it would truly belong on the bottom 100 .   
0	i too like dafoe as an actor but i wasted a few hours of my life actually watching this film ,  i still cant believe i managed to watch it in its entirety .  was there actually a point to the film ?  ,  and the ending ,  well ,  im glad i never paid to see this awful pointless piece of pathetic excuse of a film !   im not sure without hunting the facts out but is dafoe married or seeing the awful actress in this film in real life ,  if so was it an attempt to kick start her career ?  ,  if so im afraid it must have failed .  .   i post this in the hope i can actually put someone off watching this film ,  even if 1 person takes heed of my comments and decides they would much rather watch paint drying i will feel i have made some good in the world ,  if only i had had the same advice .  .  . 
1	this isn't as violent as i was expecting which makes the violent scenes appear all the more brutal and effective .   there are a lot of twists and turns and back stabbing and double crossing all the way through the film making it hard to know who's side a particular character is on .   the plot is pacey with some good dialogue and character development and gives an interesting view of the workings of the triad gang it follows .   the violence when it comes is brutal ,  no guns or martial art scenes with special effects ,  this is believable in your face violence and for all the dialogue you are never allowed forget that the triad is a violent criminal organisation .   the ending is surprising but thoroughly consistent and believable . 
1	this film has great acting ,  great photography and a very strong story line that really makes you think about who you are ,  how you define yourself ,  how you fit in ,  whether you accept to play a role or break free .  .  .  there already are excellent comments dealing with these aspects .  i want to comment on the formal setting of the film .  basically ,  it's two people on a roof .  there is unity of place and time ,  with 2 protagonists ,  and the radio acting as the choir .  many directors have turned greek tragedies into film ,  many directors have filmed contemporary stories as if they were a greek tragedy ,  but no director ,  in my opinion ,  has succeeded as admirably as ettore scola in approaching the purity and force of the great greek tragedies both in story line and formal setting .  a masterpiece . 
1	hmmm ,  yeah this episode is extremely underrated .   even though there is a lot of bad writing and acting at parts .  i think the good over wins the bad .    i love the origami parts and the big 'twist' at the end .  i absolutely love that scene when michelle confronts tony .  it's actually one of my favorite scenes of season 1 .    for some reason ,  people have always hated the reincarnation episodes ,  yet i have always liked them .  they're not the best ,  in terms of writing .  but the theme really does interest me ,   i'm gonna give it a three star ,  but if the writing were a little more consistent i'd give it four . 
1	this is the moving tale of scotland's legendary hero ,  rob roy ,  and his battles with the feudal landowners .  like braveheart to which it is frequently compared ,  it is not very historical .  despite their primarily fictional nature ,  i rate both of these movies highly and would be hard pressed to choose between the two .  the 13 century william wallace is ,  as others have noted ,  a larger than life national figure ,  while the early 18th century rob roy comes across as an honourable but ordinary scotsman .   the story revolves around a clan chieftain ,  robert roy mcgregor ,  who lives in a scottish highland cottage with his wife mary and their two young sons .  as the movie begins ,  he and his fellow clansmen are hunting down some thieves who have stolen the local lord's cattle .  rob roy then wishes to improve the living conditions of his people so arranges to borrow one thousand scottish pounds from a local noble ,  the marquis of montrose ,  in order to buy cattle to herd to market .  he temporarily entrusts this money to his friend ,  alan mcdonald .  when both mcdonald and the money turn up missing ,  rob roy finds himself in conflict with montrose as well as his despicable protégé ,  archibald cunningham ,  and his sleazy factor ,  killearn .  rob roy's honour is also tested when montrose seeks to involve him in false testimony against his rival ,  the duke of argyle ,  whom he wishes to accuse of being a jacobite .   the charismatic liam leeson is brilliant as the kilted highlander rob roy ,  an intelligent ,  virile ,  and noble hero and a man whose sense of honour is pivotal to this tale .  personally ,  i feel that this is neeson's best performance ,  his brogue  ( albeit irish )  adding authenticity for the average viewer .  rob roy is a stubborn ,  proud ,  courageous ,  and honest man whose word can be trusted .  he is a loving husband & father ,  and also touchingly loyal to his friend ,  mcdonald ,  who is accused of robbing him .    tim roth masterfully portrays his major adversary and surely one of the most heinous and sadistic cinematic villains ,  archibald cunningham ,  an egotistical ,  ruthless strutting peacock .  he is very effeminate for someone who makes it his major business to ravish the local women ,  whether willing or otherwise .  the pathetic cunningham himself constantly refers to the fact that he is a bastard unaware of his own father's identity ,  though this hardly justifies his horrendous misdeeds of murder ,  rape ,  and thievery .  also ,  he mercilessly casts aside the young servant girl ,  betty ,  after she becomes pregnant with his child ,  resulting in her suicide .  john hurt plays the arrogant and foppish montrose ,  who is eventually implied to be cunningham's father .   the movie is essentially the very believable love story between an ordinary man and his wife ,  beautifully depicting the passionate relationship between rob roy and mary .  those who question the presence of passion within marriage should watch this husband and wife !  i think the phrase used by this pair ,  'how fine you are to me .  .  . ' is surely one of the most beautiful expressions of love in all cinema .    the most compelling performance is possibly by jessica lange as rob's wife ,  mary mcgregor .  lacking make up ,  she has the pretty but natural look of a sturdy peasant wife and mother .  the actress brings great courage and dignity to her role when she is brutally raped by the despicable cunningham ,  while the disgusting killearn looks on .  her dialogue is plain spoken but filled with pride and grace .  i give hollywood its due that for once they showed just enough in the rape scene to reveal its cruelty as well as mary's pain and humiliation ,  but nothing intended to sensationalize .  their kinsman ,  alastair mcgregor ,  shows emotional anguish when he learns of mary's rape ,  and further torment when she swears him to secrecy never to reveal to her husband her violation by cunningham .    of course this film features the beautiful scenery of the scottish highlands ,  also lavish period costumes and appropriate musical scoring .  there are no grand battle scenes as in braveheart ,  but continuous engaging action and a particularly gripping sword fight in the final duel between rob roy and cunningham .  this is a captivating movie featuring both tense action and a beautiful love tale . 
1	this movie is very entertaining ,  and any critique is based on personal preferences - not the films quality .  other than the common excessive profanity in some scenes by murphy ,  the film is a great vehicle for his type of humor .  it has some pretty good special effects ,  and exciting action scenes .   as a finder of lost children ,  murphy's character starts off looking for a missing girl ,  which leads him on the path for which others believe he was  " chosen "  - - to protect the golden child .  the young boy is born as an enlightened one ,  destined to save the world from evil forces ,  but whose very life is in danger ,  if not for the help of murphy ,  and his beautiful ,  mysterious and mystical helper/guide/protector .   also ,  there are moments of philosophical lessons to challenge the audience members who are interested in pondering deep thoughts .  one such scene is where the golden child ,  that murphy's character is solicited to protect ,  is tested by the monks of the mountain temple .  an elderly monk presents a tray of ornamental necklaces for the child to choose from ,  and the child is tested on his choice .   this is a fantasy/comedy that is based on the notion that there are both good and evil forces in our world of which most people are completely unaware .  as we accept this premise of the plot ,  we must let go of our touch with a perceived daily reality ,  and prepare for the earth and walls to crumble away ,  and reveal a realm of evil just waiting to destroy us .   this is an excellent movie ,  with a good plot ,  fine acting ,  and for the most part ,  pretty decent dialogue combining a serious topic with a healthy balance of martial art fighting ,  and eddie murphy humor . 
1	franco proves ,  once again ,  that he is the prince of surreal & erotic cinema .  true ,  much of his work can be viewed as entertaining sleaze but with succubus  ( necronomicon )  he shows what he is truly capable of when he lets his warped creativity run riot and gives us a film that is both hypnotic and enigmatic whilst still maintaining the delirious eroticism intrinsic in his work .  jerry van rooyen's splendid score pulsates as the viewer is thrown from one bizarre scenario to another as we follow the trials of a striptease artist  ( reynaud )  who may be schizophrenic ,  or may indeed  ( as one mysterious character states )  be a devil ,  attempt to come to terms with the world she inhabits .  a beautiful and enigmatic piece of cinema highly recommended to anybody with even a passing interest in alternative cinema . 
1	first of all ,  this movie is 34 minutes long ,  which means you could watch it three times in a row and still have spent less time than you would have watching most other movies .  second of all--you need to do this .  this sensational short film explores the potential of animation through a world of playful or horrifying but always powerful images .  cats riding in and drinking out of a water elephant ,  a circus featuring a bird that has consumed the sky ,  and pigs eating their own fried flesh--that's only the beginning .  the scenes and images ,  extraordinary on their own ,  flow together without obvious causal links in a way that demands re-watching .  furthermore ,  the dvd includes an amazing director's commentary ,  which ,  given the extremely spare dialog ,  only enhances the viewing .  the commentary gives a few interpretations of scenes ,  but also provides priceless quotes on the crafting of cat soup ,  along the lines of :   " well ,  the artists were asking what we should do in this scene ,  but i didn't know myself ,  so its hard to say why it turned out as it did "   ( that's a bad paraphrase by the way )  .  also ,  the sound throughout the film is very high quality ,  very precise ,  and very moody .  in all ,  the absolute minimum viewing experience should go as follows :   first viewing :  watch the dvd without the commentary .  second viewing :  watch the dvd with the commentary .  third viewing :  rewatch without the commentary .   once you've watched it three times ,  however ,  you're not going to stop there .  .  . 
1	one of the most beautiful movies ever made in ex yu . story is very familiar to people in ex yul because generation after war used to live in the same way . people in the west cant imagine how political situation in our country affect people . the plot is in the 50 "  , when josip broz tito said no to the sssr and politbiro and because of that our borders becomes open for western influence . but , in a country were people didn't had much money jeans was only ideal and friendship was everything . the friendship between for young people an a girl was so strong that after 40 years of their emigration from yu is still alive . they get together after all this years on ester " s funeral and they start to remember of their childhood , before their went to the emigration and become successful people . 
1	another demonstration of kurosawa's genius ,  his first colour film is a darkly surreal look into the tragic lives of tokyo slum dwellers ,  essentially a series of interweaving vignettes depicting several groups of people eking out a perilous existence in a harsh and uncaring post-war shanty town .  swinging from comedy to tragedy and back ,  this film shows how people deal with the worst kind of life each in their own way ,  mostly retreating into themselves and living in the fantasy worlds of their own heads ,  withdrawing emotionally from those around them or drowning themselves in alcohol .  mixing kitchen-sink realism with kabuki-esque theatrics ,  kurosawa toys expertly with the emotions of his audience ,  drawing tears and laughter with equal deftness .  a wonderful ,  draining experience . 
1	i imagine victorian literature slowly sinking into the mire of the increasingly distant past ,  pulled down by the weight of its under-skirts .  along comes television :  at its best ,  it has a redemptive power ,  and with dramatisations like those the bbc produce so finely ,  victorian literature gets a new stab at life .  the religious themes ,  the moral overtones ,  may be increasingly ill at ease in a world no longer easily shocked ,  and acquainted with cohabitation ,  affairs and domestic violence .  but those old ,  well-told stories have enduring power ,  and this is one's a hidden gem .   it's hard to gauge today just how forceful ,  feminist and extraordinary ann bronte's masterpiece ,   " the tenant of wildfell hall "  ,  actually was .  emerging from the primeval slime of restrictive corsets  bodily ,  mental ,  societal  her heroine ,  helen huntingdon ,  escapes a miserable marriage ,  flees brutality and alcoholism ,  braves not only her abusive husband's fury ,  but society's pinched intolerance and malicious gossip ,  to wreak change in her life .  she pays a price ;  but retains her self-respect ;  she falls in love along the way ;  she emerges battered but victorious ,  and strong .  i just love watching women like these on screen .   the actors are superb  the best brits have to offer .  the love story is beautifully handled ,  with real passion and feeling by well-matched actors .  tara fitzgerald inhabits every aspect of the complicated heroine ,  and as has been said here by other reviewers ,  no less sharply defined and beautiful a face could survive that petrifying hairstyle .  toby stephens ,  striking sparks off her ,  contributes just the right combination of headstrong ,  handsome youth and passionate ,  yearning vulnerability .  rupert graves  ( one of my favourite british actors ever )  enjoys himself as the charismatic villain  ( so much so that you're almost with him at the end .  no one's perfect )  .  the supporting cast ably create a world into which you sink without feeling that coarse compromises have been made to modern tastes ,  and without having felt preached to .  another bbc classic ,  highly recommended :  this is how romantic literature should be dramatised . 
0	i couldn't believe it .  i had to rub my eyes a few times .  was it true ?    yes ,  there were billy dee williams ,  jeff conaway ,  maxwell caulfield and tracy scoggins - all of them have some manner of talent but here they all were in what basically adds up to a cinemax-style skin flick set on board a spaceship !   sad as it is ,   " alien intruder "  tries to be unique ,  with a computer virus/alien demon/harpy/whatever else you want to call her named ariel  ( scoggins )  infiltrating this sort-of high-tech virtual reality station on board a spaceship where four men are allowed to live out their fantasies as the system is over-seen by their captain  ( williams )  .   interesting ?  maybe ,  but here everything just plays out like a well-padded episode of  " red shoe diaries "  .  williams out-classes everything right and left ,  and looks like he'd rather be doing anything else ,  anywhere else .  ah ,  the things people do for money .  .  .  .   the fx are pretty static ,  maybe even less than what you'd expect for a straight-to-video cheapie like this .  unfortunately ,  even the female nudity is less than you'd expect .  sexual innuendo is the real star here and ,  of course ,  it gets all the best scenes .   if you like a movie that's all tease and no brains ,  check out  " alien intruder "  .  of course ,  you'll probably have to look no further than cinemax at 2 or 3 in the morning .   no stars ,  not even for what star power this flick can muster .   leave this one lost in space . 
1	a delightful little thriller opens with trevor howard in his jag convertible and ends on a dockside in liverpool .  it's all thrills and spills as the ex-spy has to restart his career just as he's getting some serious r & r cataloguing butterflies  ( how british is that ?  )  .   trevor howard and jean simmons frolic from london to newcastle-upon-tyne to liverpool  ( via ullswater )  - he's just been thrown out of mi5 or something ,  and she ,  you guessed it ,  is on the run ,  wrongly accused of murder .  there's seedy docks ,  rolling lake district hills ,  sheep ,  country pubs ,  coppers getting lost ,  waterfalls ,  a bunch of amateur cyclists ,  rooftop chases ,  and lots of chinamen  ( don't ask )  ,  and it's all very hitchcocky and hannayesque .  .  .    .  . and a smashing example of british noir .  .  . 
1	this ,  and  " hidden fortress "  are the kurosawa's that are most dear to me .  i don't hand out 10's like candy ,  but this certainly deserved it ,  if anything .  even though it's quite long  ( like all kurosawa's pretty much are )  it concurred the problem which bugs me with most of his films ;  the storyline is often too loose and slowly evolving ,  containing scenes that are unnecessary or just lenghtened too much without any real purpose to the storyline or the character description .  dodesukaden delivered to me the same experience that for example  " hidden fortress "  did ;  despite its lenght ,  there wasn't a single minute i would cut out .   this is also a very unusual kurosawa film in a way ,  it has no storyline ,  but many little independent stories which are based more to the character description than storyline ,  unlike any other kurosawa-film i have seen so far .  it also leans much on the dialogue ,  which he uses brilliantly  ( especially in the story between the father and the son planning their  " new house "  )  .    still the thing that makes this one a masterpiece is how the subject being so tragic as it is ,  is managed to be described so humanely and sympathetically ,  without pointing fingers at anybody at any point .  from the beginning to the end it delivers the whole emotional scale from laughter to tears in perfect balance . 
1	after not having much luck at selling his screenplays to the new movie industry during the first decade of the 20th century ,  in 1908 playwright d . w .  griffith got the job that would make him a legend :  he was hired by the biograph company as a director of movies .  it wasn't really what griffith had expected when he decided to enter the movie business ,  but he accepted the job ,  and in less than a year he became biograph's most successful director thanks to his original approach to film-making and the wild inventive of his narrative .  many years later ,  he would direct  " the birth of a nation "  in 1915 ,  the movie that would revolutionize film-making and make him one of cinema's first recognized authors ;  however ,  a lot of what would make him a great filmmaker can be found in the many short films he made for biograph company in the early years of his career .  1909's  " the sealed room "  is one of those ,  and also one of the few horror movies of that very first decade of the 20th century .    " the sealed room "  is a story set in the 16th century in which a count  ( arhtur v .  johnson )  has built a windowless room in his castle .  it is a small yet nice and very cozy room ,  as it is meant to be used to enjoy the love and company of his wife ,  the countess  ( marion leonard )  in a more private way .  however ,  the count doesn't know that his wife is not exactly faithful ,  as she is infatuated with the minstrel  ( henry b .  walthall )  at court ,  with whom she is having an affair .  as soon as the count gets busy with his own business ,  the countess calls the minstrel and both lovers go to enjoy the count's new room .  when the count returns ,  he discovers she is missing and begins to suspect ,  finally discovering the two lovers in his room ;  but instead of making a scene ,  he prefers to remain hidden as he decides that there is a better punishment for his unfaithful wife :  to seal the windowless room with the couple inside .   written by griffiths' regular collaborator frank e .  woods ,   " the sealed room "  takes elements from edgar allan poe's  " the cask of amontillado "  and mainly honoré de balzac's  " la grande breteche "  to create a haunting gothic melodrama based on the themes of treachery and sadism .  despite having a runtime of 11 minutes ,  woods' screenplay develops the story in a very good way ,  and plays remarkably well with the horror elements of the story .  while a melodrama at heart ,  woods focus on the character of the count and his sadism creates one of the best horror characters of these early era .   " the sealed room "  is definitely a very simple and basic story ,  but woods handling of the dark and morbid thematic of its plot makes the story a very entertaining film that was very different than most griffith's melodramas .   in  " the sealed room "  ,  griffith uses his talents to experiment with tension and suspense in a different way than his usual .  while he often played with editing to create thrillers that excited his audience ,  in this movie his focus was to create desperation and horror ,  playing with the inherent feeling of claustrophobia that the source stories had .  it is interesting how the story starts as another of his melodramas and slowly the pacing becomes faster as the horror themes begin to dominate the plot ,  culminating in his great use of editing for the final scenes .  not being a movie where camera tricks are essential ,  what shines the most in  " the sealed room "  is griffith's talent to direct his actors ,  as the legendary filmmaker manages to bring the best out of his cast with his usual natural style far removed from the staginess that was the norm in his day .   as usual ,  the cast was comprised of usual collaborators of griffith ,  starting with arthur v .  johnson as the count .  johnson gives a great performance and truly conveys the character's transition from loving husband to sadistic monster .  his performance is not without a touch of overacting ,  but actually that adds realism to the character's exaggerated personality .  as the countess ,  marion leonard looks very good and is also very effective in her acting ,  conveying a natural charm that makes hard not to sympathize with her in her treachery .  finally ,  the legendary henry b .  walthall appears as the handsome minstrel ,  and while far from being one of his best performances ,  he manages to give a proficient acting that also adds a nice touch of comedy to the film .  while not of real importance to the plot ,  it's nice to see other members of griffith's stock company in the background ,  like his wife linda arvidson and a young mary pickford as nobles at court .   while not exactly a masterpiece ,   " the sealed room "  is a notable exercise of editing to create suspense and tension like griffith used to do in those days .  the movie has very good set design and while of a very low budget ,  griffith's care for details makes it look very convincing and works perfectly along with his directing style .  the change of focus to horror makes it to stand out among other of his films from that era ,  and johnson's performance as the sadistic count makes it worth a watch .  while griffith will always be remembered for his highly influential  ( and controversial )   " the birth of a nation "  ,  the early short films he made before it really give a good idea of the development of the techniques and the style that would make him a legend .  simple yet elegant ,   " the sealed room "  is a fun movie to watch and one of the few horrors of the first decade of the 20th century .  7/10
1	petter mattei's  " love in the time of money "  is a visually stunning film to watch .  mr .  mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations .  this is a movie that seems to be telling us what money ,  power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter .    this being a variation on the arthur schnitzler's play about the same theme ,  the director transfers the action to the present time new york where all these different characters meet and connect .  each one is connected in one way ,  or another to the next person ,  but no one seems to know the previous point of contact .  stylishly ,  the film has a sophisticated luxurious look .  we are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat .   the only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits .  a big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment ,  as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter .   the acting is good under mr .  mattei's direction .  steve buscemi ,  rosario dawson ,  carol kane ,  michael imperioli ,  adrian grenier ,  and the rest of the talented cast ,  make these characters come alive .   we wish mr .  mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work . 
1	an absolutely brilliant show .  the second season began where the first ended ,  with much mystery .  suspense in most ,  if not all episodes and mystery everywhere .  one that made me think and think again .  it's truly amazing how the writer can come out with all the connections and link all the characters together and combine all these elements to make the lives of the characters in the show so meaningful .  never fail to excites and i am looking forward to the new season .  hopefully more secrets will be reveal and at the same time ,  more mystery to be solved .  good selection of cast too for this show ,  fit the characters perfectly .  really can't wait to finally discover the secret .  hopefully all the hype won't spoil the ending . 
1	 " a mouse in the house "  is a very classic cartoon by tom & jerry ,  faithful to their tradition but with jokes of its own .  it is hysterical ,  hilarious ,  very entertaining and quite amusing .  artwork is of good quality either .   this short isn't just about tom trying to catch jerry .  butch lives in the same house and he's trying to catch the mouse too ,  because «there's only going to be one cat in this house in the morning -- and that's the cat that catches the mouse» .   if you ask me ,  there are lots of funny gags in this cartoon .  the funniest for me are ,  for example ,  when mammy two shoes sees the two lazy cats sleeping and says sarcastically «i'm glad you're enjoying the siesta» and that she hopes they're satisfied because she ain't ,  making the two cats gasp .  another funny gag is when tom disguises himself as mammy two shoes and slams butch with a frying pan and then butch does the same trick to tom .  of course that ,  even funnier than this ,  is when the real mammy two shoes appears and both  ( dumb !  )  cats think they are seeing each other disguised as mammy and then they both attack her on the  " rear "  - lol .  naturally that she gets mad and once she gets mad ,  she isn't someone to mess with .  but even jerry doesn't win this time ,  because he is expelled by her too . 
1	i first saw this movie when i was about 10 years old .  unfortunately i could not watch it to the end because it was aired late at night .  now i bought it on dvd because i can remember that i liked it .   this is really not an ordinary horror movie .  it has some horror elements but i rather categorize it as fantasy .  i liked it but i hoped for a bit more horror and scary scenes .  especially the scene when anna's dad comes into the paperhouse trying to kill her is a bit short .   now to the plot .  this movie is about a young girl named anna who gets ill .  while she is ill and has to lie in her bed because of her high fewer she turns on to finishing her drawing about a house - the paperhouse .  when she fells a sleep ,  which often strangely happens just immediately ,  she finds herself near the house on a big green field .  she realizes that the house is exactly like the one she has drawn and that every new detail also appears in her dreams .  one day she draws a boy into the house to have somebody to talk to .  as she forgets to draw his legs  ( because he is sitting behind a window )  the boy cannot walk .  later she is being told by the doctor ,  that a boy also has this strange disease and she realizes that with the boy she has drawn ,  she also got that boy into her disturbing dreams .  she also notices that it gets harder and harder for her to wake up from her dreams .  as she misses her father who is ofter abroad she draws her father into the house .  she makes a mistake and her father is looking very angry on the painting .  she tries to rubber him out but realizes that she cannot change anything already drawn .  and next time she falls asleep the horror begins .  her father is mad and blind  ( because she draw s*** on his head to mark him as 'invalid' )  and tries to get into the paperhouse and kill anna and his friend .  her dreams became a horrendous nightmare .  they manage to escape and to kill her father and anna can finally wake up .  than anna finds her self in the hospital where her parents are sitting beside her bed .  the doctors thought that she fell into a coma or so .  they tell anna that the other boy died and that they want to travel to the ocean to get over those tragical happenings .  anna draws a watchtower and notices that the same watchtower can be found near the hotel they traveled to .  she runs to the watchtower and meets the boy  ( i am just not mentioning his name because i cannot remember it and do not want to go back to the previous html page )  and can say good bye to him and forget those terrible dreams forever .   there were a few thing i did not understand in the movie .  first of all it was the ending which i absolutely dislike .  i think it is too long while the main part of the movie becomes a bit too short .  how does the boy fly a helicopter and speak to anna as he is supposed to be dead ?  why did you have to put such a stupid radio on the wall ?  i hated that scene it was so dumb to me .  it almost ruined the main horror scene .   things i liked were the scene with the photograph of anna's dad which was the first real scary and horror scene .  i liked the boy .  the actor was awesome .  he was even better than anna .  i also liked how anna tries to get her father out of the painting while she is asleep and how she is looking for it in the garbage .   overall a good movie .  i give it a 8 out of 10 . 
1	in the ten years since wildside aired ,  nothing has really come close to its quality in local production .  this includes the two series of the enjoyable but overrated underbelly ,  which have brought to life events in the recent criminal history of both sydney and melbourne .  the miniseries blue murder  ( which also starred tony martin ,  but as someone on the other side of the law )  may be the exception .   wildside is currently being repeated late at night on the abc .  having not watched the show in quite a while ,  i'm still impressed by its uncompromising story lines and very human characters .  the cast is excellent :  tony martin as a detective haunted by the disappearance of his son ,  rachael blake  ( who later hooked up with martin in real life )  as a community worker struggling with alcoholism ,  and alex dimitriades as a young cop whose vice is gambling .  equally good support roles are provided by aaron pederson ,  jessica napier ,  mary coustas  ( yes ,  effie herself )  ,  and a young abbie cornish .   the abc inexplicably released only the first three episodes on dvd a couple of years ago .  the logic of this sort of marketing is beyond me ,  but i'm guessing it may have something to do with licensing disagreements with the original producers .   a great series which has aged remarkably well .  here's hoping the abc's dvd department gets its act together .    ( according to a moderator on an abc message board ,  some sort of further dvd release is due in december 2009 ) 
1	this film tells the story of a romance between albert einstien niece and a gas station attendant .  in order to get the two together ,  einstien agrees to help ed ( hudsucker proxy's tim robbins )  learn to act more intelligent .  this impresses catherine  ( meg ryan )  .  unfortunately einstien goes too far and ed is considered to be a genius .  hilarity ensues .  not to be missed .  filmed in mercer county new jersey at princeton university ,  lawrenceville prep school  ( doubling for princeton university )  as well as a beautiful vintage gas station in hopewell . 
0	while watching this movie i got sick .  i have been grewing up with pippi and every time was a real pleasure .  when my wife came to sweden she was looking at the oldies and had a real good laugh .  but this american version should be renamed and never be shown again .  it is terrible from beginning to it's end .  how can they manage to make it soo bad .  well i guess someone blames the translation ha ha ha .  .  but they are never close to pippi .  may this movie never been seen again and never sent out on a broadcast .  burn the movie and save the kids .  if you want to look at pippi then look at the original movie and have a good laugh .  we love pippi inger nilsson ,  sorry tami erin you will never stand up to be pippi .  .  oh yes .  .  when read the  " spoilers "  explanation ,   " 'spoiling' a surprise and robbing the viewer of the suspense and enjoyment of the film .  "  well i guess the director stands for this .  .  .  you are looking at this movie at your own risk .  .  it is really a waste of time .  .  . 
1	it's a colorful slasher movie .  that's about it .   it has the mystery element that scream made so popular in slasher movies ,  but i never care for such things .  figuring out who's the bad guy is not that interesting considering the clues are all misleading anyway .   the death scenes were inventive and gorey ,  bringing back memories of 80's horror movies like friday the 13th .    another nice thing about this movie is that it's hard to pinpoint the surviving girl ,  unlike in scream and ikwydls where it was obvious .    people who don't like slasher movies won't like this movie .  as simple as that .  i truly enjoyed it and i plan to watch it again while waiting for more of the same .    --mb
1	this is a visual adaptation of manga with very little dialogue .  what dialogue there is appears in word baloons as it would in the manga .  the plot of this is existent but only vaguely accounted for .  there is an issue of the manga on which this is based available in english in the blast books collection ,  'comics underground japan' ,  and it has actual captioned dialogue that explains the plot a bit more than here .  i recommend checking that volume out if you liked this ,  as it explains some of the  " plot "  of the movie ,  which is otherwise inexplicable .  animation wise this is pretty decent ,  good unintrusive use of computers and the images are for the most part realized well .  it jumps in and out of episodes ,  as the characters ,  a cat and his brain-dead older sister cat wander in and out of a series of odd images :  a boat ,  a circus ,  a desert .  for a mere half hour they go through a number of semi-plots and settings ,  which leads me to believe that the director chose a number of issues of the long-running manga to adapt at random ,  but primarilly selected visually .  knowing what's going on might somewhat increase appreciation .  this reminds me mostly of the kind of stuff they used to play on the mtv show ,  cartoon sushi ,  in particular a short that features a cat chasing a man's severed butt-cheek around the house .  only in this case the cats resemble hello kitty more and their adventure is expanded to include death and reincarnation and a number of other themes [though not all that easy to tell what's going on] .  the dvd of this has director's commentary and a  " making of "  features ,  but i cant comment on those because i didnt get around to them .  i'm giving this a 8/10 for now ,  here isnt much to compare it to in anime ,  and i hope for more like this . 
0	now ,  i hired this movie because brad dourif was in it .  he is an excellent actor ,  brilliant in everything .  .  . except this movie .  and i think that was only because he realized how stupid this movie was ,  and didn't bother with a good performance .  this movie is a unintentional-comedy .  some of the lines just crack me up .  and them there are some lines that make no sense ,  and it seems like tobe hooper just throw lines in without thinking about the plot .  oh !  btw the plot is bad !  but it one of those films that is taht bad that its actually painful to watch .  i recommend this only for big brad dourif fans ,  or fans of any of the other actors ,  because the plot is pathetic . 
1	i read several mixed reviews and several of them downright trashed the movie .  i originally became interested in this project because it was being directed by tony scott and i have become very interested in his work after man on fire had such a profound impact on me .  before i start my review ,  let me first say this .  .  . it's wonderful to see that this movie could have been told in a boring and ordinary manner ,  yet the writers and scott chose a different approach .   plot :   simply stated ,  it's not boring .  most hollywood movies give 'tried and true' plots that they know will connect with people ,  often ensuring the audiences acceptance of the film and creating a higher probability of profit .  this plot was one of the more interesting ones i had seen in a while .  just for reference ,  i recently watched 'the weather man' and 'lord of war' and while i will say that these movies are excellent ,  and i enjoyed them both tremendously ,  both the plots in these movies are boring and they are told exactly how you would expect them to be told .  they don't take any chances whatsoever ,  and they are extremely predictable after you've watched a fair amount of american films .  domino's plot is both interesting and told in a manner that keeps you thinking ,   " oh man ,  they're screwed now "  .  and i feel that has been lacking in a lot of recent films .  it has a lot of depth to it ,  in my opinion ,  and gives you plenty of things to question while watching it .  overall ,  this is what kept me so interested in the movie .   characters :   i felt that the characters were accurate .  knightley did a wonderful job of portraying a beautiful woman ,  who was anything but on the inside and wanted to be viewed as what she was .  it was obvious that she wanted to prove herself and she took whatever means she had to accomplish that .   choco was also very believable ,  his use of spanish in inappropriate situations ,  his reactions to domino's lack of affection ,  as well as his jealousy issues within the team .  .  . they all rang true to me ,  which made me feel that his character was that much more realistic .   rourke's character was the least interesting to me ,  but it still rang true to me .  he seemed like an ordinary guy ,  trying to make ends meet .  i hope that's what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with him because that's what i got out of it .  he did a very good job of showing ed in an average joe kind of way that has made his mistakes ,  yet is still trying to live .   claremont/ladies :  i believe that they provided much needed 'heart' to the story .  they weren't just people who are out getting money to buy a bentley ,  these were real people who had a real problem and they sought others mean to accomplish that goal .  you could empathize with them because ,  to them ,  this child's illness was a problem with no other solution .  these characters were supposed to show real people who are less fortunate who got into this mess because they needed help .   the mobsters :  they made the story seem sinister in a way that only the mob can .  and i really liked that part .  they also padded the story with small intricacies that made the plot that much more interesting .   christopher walken/90210 guys :   they provided the comic relief in an otherwise very serious movie .  from walken's awkward statements to the ceaseless references to the 90210 guys being has-beens .  their involvement in the movie only made it that much more enjoyable .   cinematography .  .  .  . yes .  .  .  . the cinematography .  this is where this movie seems to have lost a lot of potential fans .  but in my opinion i thought it was genius ,  the use of the camera to translate the mood of the current situation was extremely effective in my opinion .  i considered it a method that was properly realized but could always use improvement ,  just like anything else .  i both applaud and congratulate scott ,  the editor ,  the cinematographer and the director of photography on taking some real chances with this movie .  not only did they go far and above with its presentation ,  they went that much further .  the use of colors ,  both extremely light and extremely dark provided the 'look' of the film with a sinister and grungy look that accurately depicts the life of the mob ,  bounty hunters and the less fortunate in a manner that show that their life isn't as peachy or 'clean' as everyone else .  if you notice ,  in times of less stress or conflict ,  there were very few camera tricks if any at all .  this shows that scott and his crew were trying to achieve something with this look and weren't just doing it for the heck of it .  i realize that most people who watched this movie weren't expecting it and it cause many of them to be turned off to this film but i think it was great that scott took this approach .  hollywood films have grown predictable and bland .  most of them are shot in the same manner with the same twists and turns .  and i'm glad that scott tried to make something different .   granted ,  this movie isn't for everyone ,  but to say it's trash and has nothing to offer is completely missing the point .  i thoroughly enjoyed this film and i'm glad that i spent the money for it .  i would recommend this to all ,  but i'm sure it will only hit a chord with few .  i must agree with an earlier poster when he said that many of those who refuse to see outside the 'sphere of mtv' won't appreciate this movie ,  but i think many people will .  we should all try to enjoy it for the fact that scott and co .  took some chances and tried to deliver something that was different and unique .  and with that in mind ,  i think he succeeded tremendously . 
1	this film plays really well with an audience .  especially once the chase begins .  plus ,  trevor howard with his sensible ,  smart charms and jean simmons with her innocent demeanor and piercing eyes are terrific together .   the film starts as a psychological drama but after the murder it segues into a chase thriller as the two leads head for the border .  some may think the chase is superfluous but actually the chase is essential because it aids in clearing the mind of the jean simmons character by getting her out of the oppressive household ,  plus it helps bring out the real killer - who is suddenly put into such a position that they have to finish the job .  the killer rightly believed that once the simmons character was arrested she would be put away .  and it is true that her lack of control in the household - as well as evidence pointing her way - there is no way she would have gotten out of the murder charge .  the chase that ensues helps bring out the truth .   this is an entertaining film .  seek it out if you can find it . 
0	if it wasn't for the performances of barry diamond and art evans as the clueless stoners ,  i would have no reason to recommend this to anyone .   the plot centers around a 10 year high school reunion ,  which takes place in a supposed abandon high school ( looks more like a prop from a 1950s low budget horror flick )  ,  and the deranged student the class pulled a very traumatizing prank on .  this student desires to kill off the entire class for revenge .   john hughes falls in love with his characters too much ,  as only one student is killed as well as the lunch lady ( goonies' anne ramsey )  .  we're led to believe that the horny coupled gets killed ,  but never see a blasted thing !  this is a horrible movie that continued national lampoon's downward spiral throughout the 80s and 90s . 
1	this movie was nominated for best picture but lost out to casablanca but paul lukas beat out humphrey bogart for best actor .  i don't see why lucile watson was nominated for best supporting actor ,  i just don't think she did a very good job .  bette davis and paul lukas and their three kids are leaving mexico and coming into the united states in the first scene of the movie .  they are going by train to davis's relatives house .  davis and lukas were in the underground to stop the nazis so they are very tired and need rest .  but when they arrive home ,  their is a nazi living there and their's not much either can do about it .  it turns out the nazi only cares about money and is willing to make a deal with lukas .  their is more to the plot but you can find that out for yourself . 
0	what can i say ?  ?  ?  this movie was so dumb & stupid i thought it was a psychotic drag comedy - they should rename it  " bitching pregnant cat fight !  "  what a stupid waste of time  ,  if you want to see ( die die !  !  !   " i want your baby drag queen )  jennifer tilly being her freaky self then just rent out one of the  " chucky "  movie ,  oh ya  ,   " the bride of chucky .  "  it's more fun watching the two ugly plastic dolls  ( one of them jennifer tilly turned into the ugly female version of chucky )  having squeaky plastic rubber sex then watching daryl hannah being pregnant  ,  dumb & stupid ;  & jennifer tilly grinding up her husbang in a food processor reminded me of my mother trying to do house work !  ok it's just bad !  !  ! 
0	ten minutes worth of story stretched out into the better part of two hours .  when nothing of any significance had happened at the halfway point i should have left .  but ,  ever hopeful ,  i stayed .  and left with a feeling of guilt for having wasted the time .  acting was ok ,  but the story line is so transparent and weak .  the script is about as lame as it could get ,  but again ,  stretching out the ten minute plot doesn't leave a whole lot of room for good dialogue . 
1	story of ireland in the 70/s .  this film is a beautiful reconstruction of small time ireland in the 1970/s .  all the gang are there see below .  master boyle  ,  the boys  ,  the cannon  ,  sp o'donnell  ,  senator doogan's daugter  ,  rose  ,  agnes  ,  maura and una .  see this film . feel ireland as it was .   
0	and rent a good horror movie .  it's like the writer had never seen a horror movie before and didn't realize every single thing he wrote was clichéd and hackneyed and has been parodied to perfection in movies like  " scream "  and  " scary movie "  .   in between the scary bits is the most banal and boring dialog ever written .  stupid  " we're going to the prom "  junk .  i wanted to claw my ears off .  honestly ,   " the hills "  has better dialog .   there really was no need to make this movie .  leading lady is uninteresting and i kept thinking  " her ?  really ?  guy is obsessed with her ?  really ?  "    all the characters act in stupid ways ,  including the police .   ( cover the place in teams of 2 !  front and back !  not one sleepy cop sitting in his car with the window rolled down just waiting for his throat to be slashed .  )    the serial killer just swans about murdering everyone he wants without the least bit of problem .  no resistance from victims  ( or doors )  .  nobody has any protection or the least idea of fighting back  ( or flipping the security lock on the hotel room door )  .  the people are like mentally disabled sheep .   by the by ,  if you're a gore fan ,  you'll be disappointed too .  all the killing is kept offscreen and is -- ahem -- tastefully done .   ( so boo hoo for you !  )    none of the killings is the least bit interesting .  most of the time they've already happened by the time we find out .   the only cliché missing was the cat that always pops out in this kind of movies .   " oh kitty !  you scared me !  i thought you were the killer -- aiieeee !  "    and then at the end when it's time for the killer to die -- well ,  let's just say it's the easiest and most obvious choice .  snore .   the audience was jeering and talking back to the screen throughout .  it was too dumb to believe and not really scary enough .  don't encourage this kind of lazy film-making .    ( oh ,  and by the way -- no crowning of a prom king or queen .  no tiara .  no bucket of blood .  )    so save your money and rent  " carrie "  or  " friday the 13th "  or  " halloween "  or  " scream "  or  " scary movie "   ( any of them )  to get a good scare with some original twists . 
1	parker and stone transplant their pacy expletive-ridden humour from their animated masterpiece to a feature length live action film with generally good results .  much of the film is trey and matt running amok with their new toy box .  the plot is simplicity itself :  two average guys invent a new sport ,  a blend of driveway basketball with baseball scoring which becomes a national craze .  along the way they encounter numerous sporting movie cliches and send them up ,  along with any other bit of popular culture that comes into their sights .  it runs like a stretched south park episode ,  with the usual machine-gun dialogue ,  toilet humour and homilies from the heart .   if this film has a weakness it is the association with the team that gave us  " airplane "  and the  " naked gun "  series .  this influence is clearly seen with the heavy use of lame sight gags and the presence of a glossy and rather two-dimensional yasmine bleeth in the role usually given to priscilla presley .  robert vaughn does a little better playing the corporate b**tard that has been his party piece ever since  " bullitt "  and ernest borgnine overacts as only he can ,  but one must admit he's perfect for the role of the lunatic team owner .   for those who haven't noticed yet ,  parker and stone seem to be more comfortable as rock star wannabes than comics .  this manifests in the prominence given to the soundtrack in just about everything they create .  as usual ,  they give a good selection here including the obligatory track by their own ultra-non-pc vehicle dvda .   a special mention must go to dian bachar ,  who deserves some sort of award for enduring the difficult job of playing stan to parker and stone's rampaging pair of cartmans .   in summary ,  this is an entertaining comedy which is held back from its full potential by too much reliance on the  " naked gun/airplane "  formula .  parker and stone could do something truly brilliant  ( or absolutely awful )  if given full control over a future film .  america ,  either lock these guys up or put them in charge . 
1	this movie is an eye opener for those who can only the glamorous lifestyles of the stars .  it tells you how people who would like to do good are not able to .  plus the bomb blast scene is very real .   what you read and are taught just does not happen !  !  !   can raise your bp level by 10%  all actors played their role very well .   some scenes may / could have been avoided to include teenagers .   this movie is quite adult in nature .   not a movie that can be seen with family .   casting is great !  !  ! 
1	i only wish that return of the jedi ,  have been directed by somebody else ,  i mean ,  there is far too much ewoks scenes ,  completely unnecessary .  besides this time our heroes look like different people :  princess leia no longer fights with solo ,  luke looks boring ,  darth vader is not as evil as before ,  and yoda just dies .   but there are many extraordinary things going on this episode that i just can't hate it .   some spoilers 1- jabba the hut 2- the sail barge attack sequence .  3-the emperor  ( now that's evil )  4- the speeders chase at the endor forest .  5-the last battle .  6-the dark side seduction scene .  7-the return of anakin to the good side of the force .  8- and the last celebration .   some of those are so good that they can bring tears to your eyes .  if some scenes would have been cut ,  and another director was hired ,  this would have been as perfect as episode 4 and 5 ,  but still is extraordinary .  9 out of 10 . 
1	though this movie has a first rate roster of fine actors ,  special effects that are excellent ,  and a story line that is full of surprises ,  it wasn't picked up for studio distribution and went directly to dvd .  perhaps it contains too much 'anti-police force' information ,  or perhaps it is juts one too many action flicks released during a glut ,  but whatever the reason the big screens missed the opportunity ,  fortunately the new concept of releasing direct to dvd allows us to enjoy it .   the theme is old :  rookie reporter uncovers an inner circle of cops that are corrupt - in this case the f . r . a . t .   ( first response assault and tactical )  team ,  a group of well trained policeman created to clean up the mythical city of edison from its low point of crime ,  drugs ,  prostitution etc .  working undercover the temptation of pocketing the confiscated goods and money proves too much of an opportunity and now ,  15 years after its formation ,  frat is responsible for murder ,  drug trafficking ,  terrorizing innocent people etc .  the lead dog is lazerov  ( dylan mcdermott ,  who makes a terrifyingly real gangster !  )  and his partner rafe deed  ( ll cool j ,  even more buff than usual and proving he can be a sensitive actor )  .  reporter pollack  ( justin timberlake )  catches wind of a 'bad mistake' and reports his theory of fraud and corruption to his paper's boss ashford  ( the always reliably fine morgan freeman )  .  gradually polack convinces ashford and subsequently wallace  ( kevin spacey ,  also a consistently fine character actor )  and they aid pollack in this investigative reporting .  the closer pollack gets to the truth the more surprises and bad incidents happen and the story runs pall mall toward a series of unexpected results .   timberlake lacks the charisma to carry the lead ,  especially in the company of such seasoned actors .  but ll cool j ,  freeman ,  spacey ,  and mcdermott keep the well-oiled machine of a movie rolling to the very end .  no ,  it is not a great movie ,  but it is one that makes for an edge of the seat action flick with a message .  grady harp
1	how can anyone not love this movie  ?  i think it's a hilarious spoof of all the old gangster movies ;  if you've never seen them ,  watch this instead .  michael keaton has a ball in this role as anything goes .  one guy mangles the english language everytime he talks and griffin dunn plays a clueless d . a .  ,  but my favorite role has got to be joe piscopo .  he has all the best lines .  danny devito ,  alan hale ,  ray walston are in this star-studded movie that lampoons gangsters a lot funnier than  " mafia "  did for the criminal underground . 
1	the shining starts with jack torrance  ( jack nicholson )  driving to an isolated hotel named the 'overlook' situated high in the colorado mountains for an interview with it's manager stuart ullman  ( barry nelson )  about becoming the winter caretaker .  ullman tells jack that he will be responsible for the basic upkeep of the hotel but will be almost totally isolated from the rest of the world for six months as the harsh winter sets in .  together with his wife wendy  ( shelley duvall )  & young son danny  ( danny lloyd )  jack moves into the hotel & at first everything seems fine ,  it's a beautiful hotel ,  absolutely huge & whatever they need is at their disposal .  however the overlook hotel has a murky past with a previous caretaker murdering his entire family before committing suicide & danny has the ability to 'shine' which means he has psychic powers that let him see & hear things 'ordinary' people can't .  as the days ,  weeks & months begin to pass jack become more & more insane ,  danny keeps 'seeing' things & people while wendy becomes frantic as she doesn't have a clue what's happening to her family ,  as a heavy snowstorm leaves them trapped jack finally loses it .  .  .   this english production was co-written ,  co-produced & directed by stanley kubrick & is a fine horror film .  it appears that the shining is another film that exists in two distinct different versions & the one i will be commenting on is the shorter european cut that runs just under 2 hours in length .  the script by kubrick & diane johnson ,  is based on the novel by stephen king which i have not read so i can't compare them ,  goes for psychological horror rather than visual with only one murder during the entire film .  there are very few character's in the shining with jack ,  wendy & danny the only ones that really matter ,  since the film concentrates on them almost exclusively you care for them ,  become involved with them & what they go through .  the pace is somewhat slow but this is one film that didn't feel that long & keeps you interested throughout .  on the negative side i don't think the reasoning behind jack going crazy & wanting to kill his family was strong enough to convince me ,  the fact that jack escapes from the freezer without any explanation bugs me & i don't know if i missed something but that ending didn't make any sense to me whatsoever ,  i'm still trying to work out what that picture is all about !  there is very little in the way of violence or gore ,  a couple of rotten zombie ghosts & someone is killed with an axe but the shining is a horror film that doesn't need to rely on blood & special effects as it has a gripping story .  with a budget of about $19 , 000 , 000 the shining is technically flawless as you would expect from an obsessive filmmaker such as kubrick ,  the cinematography is brilliant with some fantastic free-flowing & smooth steadicam shots as the camera effortlessly follows the character's around the maze of corridors ,  the sets look absolutely real & instead of clichéd old haunted house themes like dark corners ,  basements & cobwebs kubrick brings things right up-to-date with brightly lit corridors ,  massive open expansive spaces & a modern decor  ( well 80's modern ,  just check that red toilet out !  )  .  the acting is good from everyone involved although as usual in horror films the little kid is highly annoying & nicholson seems crazy from the very start .  the shining is an absorbing film that i enjoyed watching although i'm not sure i'd watch it again anytime soon .  for those looking for explosions & fancy special effects you will be disappointed ,  for those looking for a good haunted house type horror with a strong story i definitely think the shining is for you ,  well worth a watch in my humble opinion . 
1	this film was shot on location in gerard gardens in liverpool ,  and was the uk's answer to films such as 'blackboard jungle' .  the film stands the test of time quite well ,  with all the moral stories still  ( or even more )  relevant today .  the film feature some fine performance from some notable british actors such as david mccallum ,  stanley baker ,  peter cushing and anne heywood .  baker plays a liverpool cop assigned to juvenile liaison duties ,  with the premise that if you catch the kids at an early age ,  they will end up being responsible adults .   notable cameos in the film include freddie starr  ( fred fowell )  and melvyn hayes  ( gloria )  .  tsai chin and michael chow play brother and sister  ( they are real life brother and sister )  who are caught up in an arsonists web .  tsai chin is still acting and can be seen in the latest nicole kidman film 'the interpretor' .   violent playground features a gun siege in a school ,  so is unlikely to be shown on tv following similar events in scotland / russia .   i lived in gerard gardens where the film was shot  ( though was not born at the time )  ,  and have fond memories of the area .  i have recently completed a documentary on gerard gardens which includes extracts from 'violent playground' ,  and a small uk film 'coast to coast' which stars lenny henry and pete postlewaite .  the tenements were demolished in 1987 and the films go some way in keeping the memory alive .   there were some complaints from the residents when the film was released ,  as the film portrayed the area in a bad light .  time has helped heal those wounds .   a little gem of a film ,  i would recommend you seek this out
1	an excellent example of  " cowboy noir "  ,  as it's been called ,  in which unemployed michael  ( nicolas cage )  loses out on a job because he insists on being honest  ( he's got a bum leg )  .  with really nothing else he can do ,  he decides that for once he's going to lie .  when he walks into a bar ,  and the owner wayne  ( the late ,  great j . t .  walsh )  mistakes him for a hit-man whom wayne has hired to do in his sexy young wife suzanne  ( lara flynn boyle in fine form )  ,  michael plays along and accepts waynes' money .  *then* he goes to suzanne and informs her of her husbands' intentions ,  and accepts *her* money to get rid of wayne !  if that didn't complicate things enough ,  the real hit-man ,   " lyle from dallas "   ( dennis hopper ,  in a perfect role for him )  shows up and michael is in even more trouble than before .    " red rock west "  gets a lot out of the locations .  director john dahl ,  who co-wrote the script with his brother rick ,  was smart in realizing the potential of a story set in a truly isolated small town that may have seen better days and in which the residents could be involved in any manner of schemes .  it's also an amusing idea of the kind of trouble an honest person could get into if they decided to abandon their principles and give in to any level of temptation .  it's an appreciably dark and twist-laden story with an assortment of main characters that are if not corrupt ,  have at least been morally compromised like michael .  the lighting by cinematographer marc reshovsky is superb in its moodiness ;  even the climax set in a graveyard lends a nice morbid quality to the whole thing .  even if the writing isn't particularly  " logical or credible "  ,  the film has a nice way of intriguing the viewer and just drawing them right in .   cage does a good job in the lead ,  but his co-stars have a grand old time sinking their teeth into their meaty and greed-motivated characters .  hopper ,  boyle ,  and walsh are all fun to watch in these parts .  timothy carhart and dan shor are fine as walshs' deputies  ( in one especially good twist ,  walsh is also the local sheriff )  ,  and there's an entertaining cameo role for country & western star dwight yoakam ,  who also graces the film with an enjoyable end credits tune .   it's quite a good little film worth checking out .  it moves forward at an impressive pace ,  and if nothing else is certainly never boring .   8/10
0	good performances can't save this terrible script ,  larded with every cliche in the chick-flick book .  both main characters are deeply unsympathetic ,  and the scene where laura linney's character reminisces about sex with her dead husband in front of her teenage son -- which i think is supposed to be poignant -- is just horrifying . 
1	an unassuming ,  subtle and lean film ,   " the man in the white suit "  is yet another breath of fresh air in filmic format from ealing studios .  while i suspect some modern viewers may initially find it obscure ,  i doubt many would fail to be charmed by the expert way the plot ,  the themes and characters are languidly relayed during the film's course .   the genuinely great alec guinness gives another fine characterization in a film perhaps not as obviously virtuoso as ealing's inspired  " kind hearts and coronets "  from 1949 .  this time ,  he merely plays one character rather than eight ,  but as the unworldly inventor and scientist sidney stratton ,  he always finds the correct tone and expression .  along with guinness' subtle ,  expressive performance ,  the rest of the cast are effective .  of the main players ,  cecil parker and ernest thesiger do stand out .  thesiger is compellingly absurd as the crippled but influential business grandee ,  while parker is dependable as the ineffectual yet pivotal mill owner and father .  father ,  that is ,  of joan greenwood ,  the deftly delectable comic actress ,  who is at her insurmountable peak in this film .  resplendent and seductive of aspect and diction ,  she is quite sublime in this film ,  a fine contrast with the similarly unusual ,  but more maladroit guinness .  the scene where she seemingly tries to tempt him is played so adeptly by the pair that it is both deeply poignant and amusing .  .  .   the themes are handled very effectively ,  with no easy morals drawn .  the complexities of the relationships between science ,  business and the workforce are insightfully and enjoyably examined .  expertly helmed by alexander mackendrick ,  this film is technically adept in all areas ;  evocative photography ,  fitting sound effects and music and a wistful script ,  all quietly impress .  a thoroughly satisfying film ,  with guinness and greenwood magnificent .   rating : - **** 1/2/*****
0	this movie will promote the improvement of the mind .  read a book !  it's incredible anyone would think this movie deserved the time and investment to make .  i've seen  " b "  movies before but the  " c "  movie has just been invented .  i didn't think i would ever enjoy power rangers since my kids stopped watching but i found myself looking for the videos fifteen minutes into  " knights .  "  high school productions are better than this and the actors involved should erase this from their resume .  embarrassment is one of many descriptions that come to mind .  my roommate ,  who loves these types of movies even turned it off .  now that has to really tell you something .  if you watch this movie ,  and like it ,  i will pray for you . 
0	i cannot believe that they managed to spend us$17million on this film .  spectacularly bad acting ,  egregious scripting and effects that you could do on your average pc ,  unbelievable plot contrivances .  .  . a reporter who can get an inexperienced stewardess a major job at the un ?  what ?  not only that ,  but the message of this film is so unsubtle that you come out feeling as if they've tried to batter you over the head with a full size crucifix .  all this movie will do will preach to the choir and make everyone else laugh at such a ridiculous waste of money .  if the makers of this film really wanted to sway people to christianity and show what it means to truly believe ,  they would have used the money to help people truly in need .  now ,  /that/ might have swayed some people into actually listening to them . 
1	a great film this ,  and a shame that it will receive little attention outside of arthouse circles and students who stay up until two in the morning to watch it on channel four .   the plot is a simple one but works very effectively ,  the blurring between child-like fantasy and hard-hitting nightmare is very well blurred .  the budget looks pretty low ,  but to the credit of those involved it doesn't show too often .  it also hasn't dated that much either .   i was lucky enough to tape this off the telly when it was on a few years ago ,  and it has withstood half-a-dozen viewings .  it's one of those films that won't appeal to all ;  though as usual ,  those with a more thoughtful approach to cinema would get a lot out of this .   charlotte buerke puts in a good performance as anna ,  the spoilt brat and it is a shame she seems to have gone from the acting scene .  cross is also very good ,  carrying the stature of his character very well within the context of the picture .   there are some genuinely  ( and i don't say that lightly )  disturbing moments in this film ,  both half-second shockers and more drawn-out tensions .  watch it with the lights out !   highly recommended .   9/10  
0	don't get me wrong  ,  i want to see marijuana legalized as much as the next guy .  i shall digress now .  the writing ,  though ,  was unrealistic .  a pta mom dealing drugs but adamant about her drugs getting into the hands of an underage person .  give me a break .  the smugness of very pretty mary louise parkers character was an insult to my intelligence .  the characters were not at all likable .  basically ,  the plot lines went nowhere .  i understand its only tv land  .  the hypocrisy was blatant .  mary louise parker is supposed to be a great mom and i am supposed to believe this .  .  .  .  why  ?  ?  ?  ?  i just got the feeling i was being preached by a show reeking of seediness .  its like saying its ok to cheat on your wife  ,  but with someone of legal age status .  ok not exactly the same thing  ,  but i think you people get my point .  that save the children stuff is wonderful for campaign trails  ,  i guess ,  but it does not hold water in a cable sitcom about a suburbanite mom  ,  as the local pot dealer . 
0	over several years of looking for half-decent films to rent for my kids ,  i've developed a sixth-sense for spotting the really cheesy ,  direct-to-video efforts that are really painful to sit through  ( for anyone over the age of eight )  .  i dropped the ball on this one and the kids spent half the movie asking me  " what did she say that for ?  "  and  " why did he do that ?  "  and my eyes got sore from rolling them every minute or so as characters did a really bad job of introducing seemingly random plot changes .  and the next time someone decides that having absolutely no skill with a sword is simply  " bringing realism "  to a film ,  please run them through with a dull butter knife .   " prehysteria !  "  was head and shoulders above this .  arrgh . 
1	this is my favorite classic .  it was filmed a little west of philadelphia ,  pa when i was 13 ,  in 1957 ,  and released the next year .  then in 1970 ,  i found myself working the very same county as a rookie pa state trooper .  i have always enjoyed checking out the different places where scenes were filmed .  i knew the owner of the downingtown diner well ,  and he had a road sign out front which told all passing motorists that this was the  " home of the blob "  .  the theater scene was in phoenixville ,  near valley forge park and it is still showing films today ! 
0	i went to see this with my wife and 3 yr old son .  he seemed to like it a lot more than my wife and i did .  the writing is surprisingly poor for a pixar / disney excursion .  in fact ,  i had a very hard time paying attention at all .  the movie does look amazing but the story just becomes so weird and long winded that i was hoping my son would fall asleep so i could pick him up and walk out .   not to say that the film isn't an interesting concept ,  it's just told so oddly ,   ( bad screenplay ?  )  especially when we  " meet the family "  for the first time .  i know we're supposed to get the impression that the family is wacky but good lord ,  they could've shortened that sequence by a good 15 minutes  ( seemingly ,  i didn't actually time it )  .  by that point i was scratching my head looking for an exit . 
0	although a film with bruce willis is always worth watching ,  you better skip this one .  i watched this one on television ,  so i didn't have to plunk down cash for it .  lucky me .   the plot develops slowly ,  very slowly .  although the first 30 minutes or so are quite believable ,  it gets more and more unbelievable towards the end .  it is highly questionable ,  if a seasoned soldier like lt .  waters would disobey direct orders .  and even if he would ,  if the rest of his platoon would .  they know he puts them in direct danger ,  and they know they will certainly die if they follow him ,  but what the heck ,  he is our lt .  so let's do what he says  ( despite the direct orders ,  remember )  .   still ,  there are some nice scenes in this movie .  they somewhat save a village ,  where the total population is being massacred by the rebels .  well ,  they save a dozen villagers or so ,  the rest was already killed .  the strange part of it ,  that they did take the trucks which the rebels left behind .  they rather go on foot .  maybe because the roads are unsafe ,  but there was no explanation for it .  anyway .  i think this was what earned the movie the one point i gave it .   what made this movie an insult to the brain and hence completely unbelievable is that a group of 7 soldiers can kill of so many rebels without being hurt or killed themselves .  only near the end they loose a few comrades .  and that is only because they have to fight of an army of nearly 500 or more .  can you believe that ?   they fight of an army of so many ,  kill hundreds of them ,  and only loose a few of themselves .  and they have rounds and round of ammo .  never run out of it .  grenades and claymore mines ,  an m60 machine gun and even an rpg .  where do they get this stuff .  carrying it around or what ?  they even got a laptop which shows them the activity of enemy rebels .  and this laptop has a battery which goes on for days .  really ?  who think up this crap .   i guess if you turn off your brain completely and accept that the rebels are a bunch of idiots ,  you give this movie a high rating .  if not ,  skip this one .  it saves you time . 
0	maddy  ( debbie rochon )  is a mentally unstable young woman with a troubled past who gets more than she bargained for when she goes to a pool party with a handsome coworker .  when her date and his friends jokingly say they belong to a `murder club , ' maddy takes it seriously and moves straight up to `level 3' by bashing in the brains of a woman in a parking garage  ( for denting her car !  )  .  but is maddy also the one donning a plastic mask and killing off other members of the group or has someone else lost it ?   the plot of this film  ( originally titled make 'em bleed )  is very poorly conceived ,  full of holes and spirals completely out of control before a ludicrous ,  out-of-left-field twist ending .  some of the dialogue is downright laughable .  i didn't have a problem with rochon's performance ,  but the supporting cast was atrocious .  however ,  i managed to sit through this full moon release thoroughly entertained .  there's plenty of skin and blood and it's the perfect type of flick to sit around with a group of your buddies and pick apart .  horror fans may also enjoy the cameos from brinke stevens and lloyd kaufman  ( as debbie's parents )  and julie strain  ( an early victim )  .   score :  4 out of 10
0	this show had pretty good stories ,  but bad dialog .  the main character was especially annoying .  it's quite obvious why this show was canceled ,  although ,  like most upn shows ,  i never knew it even existed until it was in syndicated re-runs .   most of it's plots seemed to be copied from other shows and movies ,  leading me to think the producers didn't have an original idea in their heads .    i haven't commented enough .  you've got to have at least ten lines of text .  the special effect were not bad for a 2001 show .   the gnome was a nice character . 
0	i don't even know where to begin on this one .   " it's all about the family .  "  that has to be the worst line of dialogue ever heard in a  " horror "  movie ,  although this couldn't be a horror movie even if it tried !  !  !  ugh !  !  !  and i know that owen wilson is a better actor .  he needs to stop playing the token guy who dies in every action movie  ( anaconda ,  armageddon )  .  after all ,  the man did co-write  " bottle rocket "  and  " rushmore .  "  he does have some talent .  also ,  lily taylor should stick to indie films .  she has no place here .  finally ,  catherine zeta-jones should become a porn star .  there's no room in legitimate acting for her .  i'm serious .  one of the worst movies i've ever seen ,  ever . 
1	this movie contains personalities that so deliciously are playing their parts ,  i love the final ,  when nobody knows what are they gonna do about their life ,  but it's completely great when you see and realize that the priest is right ,  is jut for two ,  so what are the other persons doing there ?  the movie embrace you to a new life ,  to experiences ,  to be able of dream with the other person and reach those dreams .  also shows you the life itself ,  hard like it is .  but gives you the option to choose what you want and what you really need .  hope this comment works for you .  the movie it did worked well for me .  i bought the movie by the way  ;  )  take care . 
0	i tried twice to get through this film ,  succeeding the first time - and it was like pulling teeth - and failing the second time despite a great dvd transfer .  the problem ?  it's simply too boring .   if you can get to the dramatic courtroom scene ,  which takes up most of the second half of the film ,  you have it made ,  but it's tough getting to that point .  there are some interesting talks by  " abraham lincoln "   ( henry fonda )  during the trial .  the ending is touching as lincoln walks off and they superimpose his memoral statue over the screen .   it's a nice story ,  well-acted and such .  .  .  . but it lacks spark in the first half and discourages the viewer from hanging in there .  i suspect the real abe lincoln was a lot more interesting than this film . 
1	the fourth in the  " dirty harry "  series ,  this film features one of the most despicable ,  ugliest ,  unlikable ,  profane ,  disgusting females i have ever seen on film :   " ray perkins ,  "  played by audrie neenan .  she is the modern nasty low-life version of the 1945  " detour "  character ,   " ann savage .  "   her foul mouth and gutter attitude turned me off so much i never watched this film again until i acquired a profanity filter which shut her up .  .  .  . and least some of her !  then i could enjoy the rest of the movie .   everywhere  " harry callahan "   ( clint eastwood )  goes ,  violence immediately follows .  .  .  .  . within minutes !  it happens so often it's almost laughable but it makes for a fast-moving ,  entertaining film with a satisfying ending as all the scumbag villains are eliminated one-by-one .   this is a very sophomoric film that appeals to our base instincts .  .  .  .  . and connects ,  sad to say .  most of us like to see these dirtballs get it in the end ,  and who does it better than dirty harry ? 
1	anyone who doesn't think bill and ted's bogus journey is one of the greatest movies of all time needs their head checked .  it somehow manages to be both completely inane and no-brainer ,  but also terrifying knowing and clever at the same time .  one of those rare films that actually improves upon it predecessor ,  bogus journey can be enjoyed again and again .  notable highlights include the duel with death and the ending ,  which is highly  " emotional "  .  keanu wants to forget all that matrix rubbish and get down to doing what he does best ,  ted theodore logan in bill and ted :  the return . 
0	put the blame on executive producer wes craven and financiers the weinsteins for this big-budget debacle :  a thrash-metal updating of  " dracula "  ,  with a condescending verbal jab at bram stoker  ( who probably wouldn't want his name on this thing anyway )  and nothing much for the rest of us except slasher-styled jolts and gore .  christopher plummer looks winded as van helsing in the modern-day--not just a descendant of van helsing but the real thing ;  he keeps himself going with leeches obtained from count dracula's corpse ,  which is exhumed from its coffin after being stolen from van helsing's vault and flown to new orleans .  this is just what new orleans needs in the 21st century !  the film ,  well-produced but without a single original idea  ( except for multi-racial victims )  ,  is both repulsive and lazy ,  and after about an hour starts repeating itself .  * from ****
0	yes ,  mtv there really is a way to market daria .  what started as a clever teenage angst- " comment on everything that sucks and make the viewer feel better about their sucky teenage life "  sitcom now mutated into a  " how you should deal with your problems " -charade .  i used to watch daria all the time and loved it .  now ,  sitting here after watching the so called  " movie "  i can only wonder what the point of this all was .  daria tells us how to lead out life in college ?  excuse me ?  didn't the point daria made every episode that what you like to do is ok ,  as long as it is ok with yourself no matter what the rest of the sick sad world thinks of it ?  this entire thing reminded me of the scene in  " reality bites "  the movie channel shows the documentry for the first time . 
0	usually i'm a bit of a fan of the bad eighties & early nineties film featuring now has beens .  .  . but this film is so incredibly terrible that it was a real endurance test to sit through .  guys dressing up as girls has been done to death - but never so pathetically .  corey haim's performance was abysmal as usual ,  nicole eggert was not much better .  this has no redeeming qualities ,  even if you are a number #1 fan of an actor/actress in this piece of trash - stay away ! 
0	waiting to go inside the theathre with tickets in my hand ,  i expected an interesting sci-fi fantasy movie which could finally feed my appetite of movies regarding robot-technology ,  instead i went disappointed by each aspect of it ,  once more proving that stunning special effects can't help a boring plot ,  which by my opinion was the worse in this year .  acting in this movie also dissatisfied me ,  will smith didn't show anything new in this movie ,  yet i never saw his acting to change since  " men in black "  which was his only success by my opinion .  he had to retire since than ,  not spoiling his name with titles like  " i , robot "  and  " men in black 2 "  .  4/10
0	john rivers' life as an architect and family man has taken a turn for the worst when his wife has disappeared and has been concluded dead after a freakish accident that involved changing a tyre on her car .  during the days she has been missing ,  he confronts a man that's been following and he tells him that his been in contact with his dead wife from the other-side through e . v . p - electronic voice phenomenon .  naturally he doesn't believe it but then hear gets weird phone calls from her phone and so he contacts the man to find out more about e . v . p .  soon enough john is hooked onto it ,  but something supernatural doesn't like him interfering with the dead ,  as now other then contacting his wife ,  the white noise is foretelling events before they happen .   since this dvd has been sitting on my shelf for a while now ,  i thought i better get around to watching it since it wasn't my copy .  but then again i don't think the owners were in a hurry to get it back ,  as they haven't question me about it .  oh well .  so i decided to give it a play ,  as i was in an undemanding mood .  after hearing and reading all the bad press on it ,  i wasn't expecting anything remotely good ,  but i was kept entertained for 90 minutes .  well ,  more so the 60 minutes ,  as the last half-an-hour was pretty much a blur of confusion .  the film is nowhere as good as it could have been ,  but the time breezed by quick enough even though it's a rather tepid supernatural thriller .  i thought it wasn't all a waste .  the first hour i found some effective sequences rather interesting and there's a spooky awe generated with a slow progression of subtle stillness and tragedy that haunts you ,  but sadly that comes to a crashing halt later on in the film .  that's when the predictably forced jump scares come into their own and somehow it just doesn't fit in with the context .  it becomes rather hectic ,  loud and very muddled with its mtv style editing and kinetic camera-work that gets to close into the action .  i couldn't understand what was going on within choppy and abrupt climax .  the whole explanation how everything fits into the bigger picture is pure hokey .  it's a very unsatisfying conclusion because it goes for something big ,  but hits rock bottom .  i thought they did fine job up until that point with the lighting and showy camera-work .  other then the distinctively stark lighting ,  the score kept this flick atmospherically gloomy .  all of it is very slickly done with its glossed up and fancy hardware ,  which makes it come across as very sterile and empty .   you can easily see that the film's heart is in the technical components and not in expanding the characters and story .  there's just no connection and lasting sentiment within this flimsy material .  after a while ,  it just tries too hard to convince you that it falls into manipulative thrills and popping in many blood-curdling stuff from beyond the grave .  it just got rather repetitious watching someone watch a fuzzy tv screen after while .  the e . v . p machine was the star on the show .  well ,  it did have more impact than the limp performances .  michael keaton is more than capable actor ,  but lately his disappeared off the map and here he provides a modest performance as the dangerously obsessed john rivers .  he really deserves much better ,  though .  everyone else is pretty brittle and forgettable .  not because of the performances ,  but of the lack of depth in their characters .  this clunker wasn't bad to begin with ,  but it does go pear shape by falling away drastically .   i wouldn't care to see it again and i wouldn't recommend to anyone ,  unless you got a interest for the subject matter and enjoy the recent crop of hollywood produced horror/thrillers .  it's just a damn shame that this over-produced flick couldn't put it together successfully ,  as it had promise in its idea and a more than decent cast on hand .  i didn't hate it ,  but what a disappointment . 
0	this movie is similar to darkness falls , and the boogeyman ( 2005 ) but it's also much more graphic than both , and not as good as either . it's also slow and fairly predictable . it's also got shades of deliverance and the amityville horror . plus , we get some new age flavour thrown in the mix and some of those scenes come off as a motivational/inspirational sermon . really , this movie is a hodgepodge of almost everything . even though it is gory , the makeup effects are not very realistic looking . in fact they look kinda cheap . aside from all that , there is some really awful clichéd dialogue . and i won't say when , but there is a point where a couple of the character's actions were not authentic or believable , given the circumstances . nobody in their right mind what would have acted this way . once you watch the movie , you'll know what i mean . there's also some gratuitous nudity for nudity's sake . it just wasn't necessary at all . the good news is that the acting was actually pretty good . better than this movie deserves . so , after carefully weighing the evidence , id say this movie was passable , but not good . my verdict for the tooth fairy : 4/10
0	this movie is a horrible distortion of lies and exaggerations that were put together by the most shameless lunatics to ever work on a tv movie .  the story is wrong and a complete lie .  there is nothing in this movie that accurately portrays senator mccarthy .  it's just a horrible scam and it amazes me that anyone associated with this production ever got another job in the industry .  the marxist-leninists who wrote this trash did so in order to attack a man who has been vindicated by history and their fear that anyone would dare to destroy communism .  unfortunately for these communist nut jobs ,  ronald reagan took over where mccarthy left off and they couldn't stop him ,  thus the end of the soviet union and its' cohorts .   never ,  ever watch this film if you're looking for truth regarding sen .  mccarthy .  read ann coulter's book ,   " treason "  for a better look at the truth about sen .  mccarthy .   it will also help if you read about what really happened to senator mccarthy by reading http : //www . thenewamerican . com/tna/1996/vo12no18/vo12no18_mccarthy . htm
0	bela lugosi plays a doctor who will do anything to keep his wife looking young and beautiful .  to this end ,  he drugs brides during their wedding ceremonies to make it look as if they are dead so he can steal their bodies .  i'm not exactly sure what he does with the bodies .  i don't remember it ever being fully explained .  all i know is that he extracts something from them and injects it in his wife .   ( i'll just guess that it's spinal fluid .  spinal fluid was all the rage of mad scientists in the 40s .  )  you can pretty much guess the rest from here .   there are a couple  ( well ,  really more than a couple ,  but i'll only write about two )  of problems that i have with this movie .  one is the way bela is used .  sure ,  he does a decent enough job in his own overacting sort of way  ( btw ,  the rest of the cast is simply abysmal )  .  but ,  to have him hiding in the back of a hearse or having him creep into the female reporter's bedroom to do nothing is just silly .  also ,  why have him beat and/or kill every henchman he has ?  is it to make him look evil ?  well ,  someone who is kidnapping comatose brides doesn't really need to be made to look more evil .   the second problem i have is the idea of drugging brides .  why brides ?  wouldn't any female under the age of 20 do ?  watching bela go through these gyrations to get his victims ,  i was reminded of the idiotic fisherman in i still know what you did last summer .  in each case ,  there would appear to be an easier way of reaching your objective than employing a seemingly impossible plan that depends way to much on circumstances out of your control .   ( btw ,  an alternate title for this movie is the case of the missing brides .  i guess that partially explains the need for 'brides' .  ) 
1	i am currently on vacation in israel for summer ,  and so was able to see this incredible film .  a bit of a warning before i begin writing :  i speak fluent hebrew ,  and so the hebrew parts were no problem ;  however ,  about a quarter  ( a bit less )  of the film is in arabic ,  and i was unable to understand a bit of this subtitled bit .  this did not detract from my understanding of the film ,  but did cause me to miss a few jokes which evoked some strong laughs in the theater .   after a year of american cinema which many hailed as one of the greatest years for homosexual cinema and relationships ,  it takes something truly special to stand head and shoulders above the rest ;  yet ,   " the bubble "  surpasses all others with its blend of excellent acting ,  witty dialogue ,  and relevant political climate .   the film opens on a checkpoint on the israeli-palestinian border ;  for the first few moments ,  we are unsure about the type of movie we have walked in on .  yet ,  this is an important element of this film's strength .  the political situation ,  and the extreme tension in the air is constantly in the background .  most importantly ,  tel aviv serves as a character of its own in this film .  it is constantly referenced .  street names and restaurant names are constantly exchanged .  the skyline and city development is critiqued quite harshly ,  and ultimately the city evolves along with the film the film focuses on the love between noam  ( ohad knoller )  and a palestinian immigrant ,  ashraf ( yousef 'joe' sweid )  ,  with the societies of tel aviv and palestine serving as a constant foil .  we always know that their relationship is forbidden ,  and this creates a sense of urgency rarely present in cinema .  the love is incredibly strong ,  and stands as the centerpiece of the film .  the secondary relationships and friendships are equally strong :  flamboyant restaurant owner yelli's  (  yousef 'joe' sweid )  relationship with the ultra-butch and grating golani solider ,  golan  ( zohar liba )  ,  is particularly a source of amusement .  the love scenes which abound in this film are all exquisite ,  fine crafted works of art ,  and the cinematography is astounding :  in the first love scene of the film ,  the camera pans down as a male character gives oral sex to lulu  ( daniela virtzer )  ,  and dissolves into a shot of noam and ashraf .  this shot any many others lead the viewer to realize that all of these relationships are expressions of the very same form of love .   to give away more of the storyline would be a tragedy ,  but know that there is a lot of political tension and tragedy which touches onto the current world political climate ,  so i will instead focus on the witty dialogue .  even when watching this movie in my second language ,  i could not stop laughing throughout .  lines of particular amusement include the question of whether gay suicide bombers receive virgin women or men in heaven ,  and an analogy of sampson from the bible as the worlds first suicide bomber .  this dialogue shows a particular sense of purity and reality which is rarely seen in cinema .  the music used in the film is also particularly powerful .  music is only used in times when characters legitimately could or should be listening to it ,  and in one scene the music weakens when a character removes one earphone and stops when he removes the other .  little elements like this truly elevate the film .   i could not give greater recommendation to a film ;  this is a superb work of cinema which is catharthic as well as extremely well crafted . 
1	i love playing football and i thought this movie was great because it contained a lot of football in it .  this was a good hollywood/bollywood film and i am glad it won 17 awards .  parminder nagra and kiera knightley were good and so was archie punjabi .  jonathon rheyes meyers was great at playing the coach .  jazz  ( parminder nagra )  loves playing football but her parents want her to learn how to cook an want her to get married .  when jazz starts playing for a football team secretly she meets juliet  ( kiera knightlety )  and joe  ( jonathon rhyes meyers )  who is her coach .  when her parents find out trouble strikes but her dad lets her play the big match on her sisters pinky  ( archie punjabi's )  wedding .  at the end her parents realise how much she loves football and let her go abroad to play . 
0	this film is the worst excuse for a motion picture i have ever seen .  to begin ,  i'd like to say the the front cover of this film is by all means misleading ,  if you think you are about to see a truly scary horror film with a monster clown ,  you are soooo wrong .  in fact the killers face doesn't even slightly resemble the front cover ,  it's just an image they must have found on google and thought it looked cool .  speaking of things they found and thought it looked cool ,  there is a scene in this film where some of the gang are searching for the friend in the old woods ,  then suddenly the screen chops to a scene where there is a mother deer nurturing it's young in a glisten of sunlight .  .  .  i mean seriously wtf ?  ?  ?  how is this relevant to the dark woods they are wandering through ?  i bought this film from a man at a market hoping it would be entertaining ,  if it wasn't horror then at least it would be funny right ?  wrong !  the next day i gave it to my work colleague ridding myself from the plague named s . i . c . k  bottom line is :  don't see this film !  !  ! 
1	i thought it was an original story ,  very nicely told .  i think all you people are expecting too much .  i mean .  .  . it's just a made for television movie !  what are you expecting ?  some great wonderful dramtic piece ?  i thought it was a really great story for a made for television movie .  .  .  . and that's my opinion . 
1	sunday july 16 ,  8 : 00pm the castro ,  san francisco   " as a southern colonel your make-up is very indiana "   the yammering gossips of hollywood have managed to sling more than a little mud in marion davies direction over the years .  that she had fame handed to her and was undeserving ,  is often speculated .  considering the mawkish dramas she was so often pushed into ,  this criticism would seem to have some validity .  as a comedienne however ,  her star shone very brightly .  left to pursue a career in light comedy and slapstick she might have rivaled mabel normand .  one of her better outings was king vidor's show people  ( 1928 )  ,  which survives and is so well known largely because mgm filled it with star cameos .  this happy coincidence inadvertently saved what is surely among the best work of its two stars ,  davies and that notorious joe college wise-cracker ,  william haines .  rumor has it show people was loosely based on the life of gloria swanson ,  who began in sennett comedies and rose to grand drama  ( and don't think she didn't spend the rest of her life reminding everyone !  )  with von stroheim ,  walsh and demille .  coincidentally ,  the comedy studios used in this film are the original digs keystone had abandoned the year before  ( think of who worked there !  )  .   colonel marmaduke oldfish pepper  ( dell henderson )  drives his daughter peggy  ( davies )  from georgia to hollywood to star in the movies .  these two country hicks are unsuspecting fodder for incorrigible billy boone  ( haines )  ,   "   a custard pie artist "  who descends on their cafeteria table in an outrageously funny entrance  ( watch for the bit with the noodle )  ,  and then helps peggy land a part in his next picture .  what she thinks is high drama turns out to be screwball ,  but a job is a job and billy convinces her  "   .   .  all the stars have to take it on the chin   "  .  at the preview ,  billy and peggy bump into .  .  charlie chaplin ,  who asks for her autograph !  she pushes the little fellow aside and a horrified billy grabs the book and makes her sign .  chaplin climbs in his car and billy tells peggy who shes just snubbed ,  so naturally ,  she faints .  it's so very funny ,  considering davies character isn't supposed to recognize this guy !  peggy soon moves on to work at the high art studios ,  changes her name to 'patricia pepoire' and leaves poor billy behind .  davies does a wonderful send-up of a serious actress ,  with all the prerequisite fluttering eyelashes and quivering lips .  vidor throws in a parade of stars eating lunch in a long tracking shot  ( and they're all sitting shoulder to shoulder ,  facing the camera !  )  that includes polly moran  ( who's also sensationally funny playing davies' maid )  ,  louella parsons  ( one of the friendly vampires )  ,  estelle taylor ,  claire windsor aileen pringle ,  the comedy duo of karl dane  ( with his arm in a sling )  and george k .  arthur  ( pretending he's stealing the silverware )  ,  leatrice joy  ( amused by arthur's antics )  ,  renee adoree ,  rod  ( eating and smoking )  la rocque ,  mae murray ,  john  ( in a robe )  gilbert  ( who also appears driving through the mgm gates early in the picture )  ,  norma  ( eeeww !  )  talmadge  ( looking bitchy and aloof as usual )  and patricia dressed like marie antoinette ,  sandwiched between douglas fairbanks  ( as he does an amusing trick )  and william s .  hart  ( protecting her from doug )  .  billy runs into the high art crew on location when the comedy troupe disrupts their filming ,  with predictably nutty results .  vidor even works himself into the final scene as the director of peggy's current production .  also worth noting are harry gribbon as the comedy director doing a great caricature of eddie sedgwick ,  sidney bracy as the dramatic director who can't get peggy to cry for her screen test and then can't stop her once she does ,  and paul ralli as andre ,  her dramatic love interest and a hilarious phony .  when her character tries to 'act' its as though davies is poking fun at all the awful dramas she'd been forced into and she's brilliant doing it .   while it's true show people is a hokey satire of the 'good ole days' ten years hence ,  it remains a highly entertaining example of quality work from mgm ,  irving thalberg ,  and their tremendous wealth of assembled talent .  what a shame so much has been lost .  there are also far too many examples of great films like the patsy  ( 1928 )  ,  vidor and davies' hugely successful comedy from earlier that same year ,  languishing in vaults when they could be seen and enjoyed .

0	poor performances by sinatra ,  martin and hyer .  grossly underdeveloped supporting characters .  annoying talky with no real plot .  ending leaves you flatter than a pancake ,  with more loose ends than you could tie up in four sequels  ( that is ,  if you even cared about these wooden characters )  .  maclaine is the only real asset .  that penultimate sequence in which the  " chicago hood "  searches for the sinatra character is laughable .  the music in that sequence also is poor .  and in the final scene when martin's character removes his hat for the woman he called a  " pig ,  "  almost made me go outside and find a stone to throw through my television screen . 
0	it's interesting that all who  ( so far )  seemed to like this film had no expectations--i guess that's the trick .  in contrast with them ,  i had optimistic expectations ,  and that was a mistake .  as soon as i saw how close to the faces the camera always was ,  i knew we were in the hands of an extremely amateur director--that's always a clear sign of them ,  they think it is arty or effective or intense to hold the camera about two inches away from the actors .  the actors in this film ,  though ,  had only one facial expression each .    if the close camera wasn't enough ,  the lack of light in the film killed it .  the film seemed to be entirely filmed in the dark .  so now we know that the cinematographer was a rank amateur ,  as well .   " ooh ooh ,  we're going to light the set with a flashlight !  that will make it all seem intimate !  "  no ,  that made it all seem invisible .   on top of the serious technical flaws ,  there was absolutely no story beyond the barest hint of an idea that was never developed ,  and nothing new about this kind of relationship was illuminated .   ( perhaps this is a new kind of film for germany ,  but in los angeles ,  forget about it .  )   the fact that this film won a couple of film festival awards doesn't indicate the quality of the film ,  but besmirches the quality of these particular festivals .  i can assure you that this film won't win anything in the festival where i saw it .  in fact ,  two times during the film it seemed that it was finally over and people started to get up to leave  ( this was one of the side effects of the cinematographer's  " total darkness "  technique )  .  but when the film shuddered on ,  instead ,  there were moans coming from the audience .  and once the movie finally did end ,  it was clear that it hadn't mattered if it actually had ended at either of the two earlier points .  an earlier ending would have saved the audience from yet more monotonous scenes of domesticity  ( folding sheets ,  cutting vegetables ,  spreading honey on bread )  .  yeah ,  we get it ,  the life of the lonely old man was boring-- but we figured that one out at the very beginning .   i recommend that audiences miss this one ,  it has absolutely nothing to offer sophisticated movie-goers . 
0	if this movie were more about piper perabo's character and less about the bar ,  this might have been halfway decent .  piper's violet stanford and karen friendly  ( adventures of rocky and bullwinkle )  both have a virgin kindegarden teacher quality to them that's endearing .  here's hoping she'll find a better movie to be in . 
0	pathetic attempt to use science to justify new age religion/philosophy .  the two have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said about quantum physics in this mess is just plain wrong .   examples ?  quantum theory supports the ideas in eastern religions that reality is an illusion .  how ?  well ,  in the world of the subatomic ,  you can never definitely predict a particles location at a specific time .  you can only give the odds of it being precisely at one spot at one time .  also ,  the act of observation seems to affect the event .  solid particles can pass through barriers .  all of this ,  so far ,  is accurate .  but then they assert that that means that if you believed sincerely enough that you could walk through a wall ,  you could indeed do it .  this is complete poppycock .  instead ,  the theory asserts that at our level ,  it is possible for you to walk through a wall ,  but it is merely by chance and has nothing to do with belief .  also you'd have to keep walking into the wall for eternity to ever have even the remotest chance of passing through the wall ,  the odds are so astronomically against it .   this is but one example of how they misrepresent the science .  but much more annoying is the narrative involving an unhappy photographer ,  played by marlee maitlan .  about halfway through the picture it becomes so confused as to be incomprehensible .  something to do with negative thoughts leading to addiction and self-hate .  there may be some truth to that ,  but quantum physics has nothing to do with it .   plus ,  string theory is the hot new thing in physics nowadays .  instead of wasting your time with this dreck ,  i suggest you rent the elegant universe ,  an amazing series done for nova on pbs that gives you a history of physics from newton and gravity to ed witten and m theory in only 3 hour-long episodes .  quantum mechanics is explained there quite well if you want to know it without the fog of metaphysical appropriation . 
1	the bible teaches us that the love of money is the root of all evil .  the love of money leads to greed which can lead to pride and eventually to destruction .  two brothers ,  andy and hank ,  will discover how far the love of money will cost them and those they love the most .   andy hanson  ( philip seymour hoffman )  and his younger brother hank  ( ethan hawke )  couldn't be more different .  andy is seemingly enjoying the success of working in new york's real estate market and is married to his beautiful wife gina  ( marisa tomei )  who is the idea of a trophy wife if one ever existed .  hank ,  however ,  is divorcée who finds himself at the mercy of his ex-wife ,  his daughter's expensive school bills ,  and endless amount of child support payments .  a man who means well and has good intentions ,  hank none the less cannot escape the water that his slowly raising above his head no matter how hard he swims to stay above it .   however ,  andy has his own problems with the only difference between him and his brother being that he hides them better .  he has committed fraud against his company and is heavily involved in drug use in order to escape his fears .  the pressure of his life ,  and the lies he needs to keep his appearances up ,  have now caused him to think about fleeing the country with gina in order to start over again .  of course ,  like hank ,  he needs money to do this and believes he knows how to get it .  how ?  by robbing the jewelery store that their parents own and run .  this act of betrayal is where the hanson brothers ,  their families ,  and several other lives ,  will be destroyed because of greed ,  pride ,  and fear .    the uniqueness of before the devil knows you're dead is the manner in which the story is told .  after the robbery goes wrong ,  and nanette hanson  ( rosemary harris )  who is the mother of both andy and hank is killed ,  the story is told from a variety of different points of view from various days before and after the robbery attempt .  we learn more about the motivations of not only andy and hank but also the reaction to their father charles  ( albert finney )  to the death of his wife .  the relationship between charles and his two sons ,  especially to andy ,  is also explored and another possible motivation of sorts is discovered after it is revealed that there is little love between the two men .  nanette may have been dearly loved by her sons but their father is a different story .   philip seymour hoffman proves once more why he is one of the most impressive actors in hollywood today by portraying andy as not only a greedy criminal with lack of morality but also ,  in contradictory way ,  as a man we can sympathize with .  ethan hawke also brings hank alive not just as a loser but really as a man just desperate to hang on to what little he has left .  andy and hank are thus brought to life in such a realistic way that it is easy to think of them as not just characters but the very real images of lost and confused men who now find themselves facing the consequence of their actions .   before the devil knows you're dead is a moral tale about how our actions lead to consequences that we otherwise might not expect to face .  more than that ,  our choices also can affect those around us in ways we never expected .  in what should have been best picture of the year ,  we see how lives are easily broken when the love of money becomes the ultimate pursuit in order to ease our troubled lives .  in other words ,  there are no easy fixes or answers to our problems and trying to find them can only make things worse .   10/10
0	my 10-year-old daughter ,  alexandra ,  writes :   i thought it was very boring ,  and i thought it was just a repeat of stuff from  " 101 dalmatians .  "  i couldn't wait for the movie to end .  the best part was the credits at the beginning - they were cute and well done .  the rest of the film is not worth watching .  thank you . 
0	i'm so confused .  i've been a huge seagal fan for 25 years .  i've seen all of his films ,  and many of those dozens of times .  i can only describe this film as  " bizarre .  "  steven seagal shares screenplay writing and producing credits on this film ,  but i have a really tough time believing he would choose to dub over his own voice for so many of his lines ,  with a thin ,  whiny imposter's voice no less .  what i also don't get is ,  if they had to dub some of his lines ,  why does his own voice appear on the rest of them ?  i expect seagal to age like the rest of us .  but the seagal in this movie barely exudes a fraction of the same swagger ,  confidence ,  bravado ,  charm ,  and sex-appeal he so easily showed us in all of his previous movies .  what i found myself missing most of all was his cocky ,  self-assured attitude and his bad-ass sneer that so easily shifts into that adorable grin .  where is that in-your-face attitude and charm that made him such a huge star ?  ?  ?  i hope that this film is not an indication of what seagal has left to offer us - if so ,  his lifelong fans will have to concede that the seagal we all knew and loved is gone . 
0	five years after the original creepshow ,  another inferior horror sequel is penned by george a .  romero and stephen king :  creepshow 2 .  this time there are only three stories instead of five .  none of the three stories is really original or distinguished either .  the first story is a horror staple ,  formulaic story about a wooden indian statue seeking revenge against the killers of its owners .  the effects are really neat in this story ,  but it's just too familiar to be compelling enough .  george kennedy and dorothy lamour play the elderly store owners .  the second story ,   " the raft "  ,  is a stephen king story .  it's about four teenagers that unwittingly spend the day on a wooden pallet in the middle of an isolated lake .  soon the kids are screaming for their lives as a watery blob does each of them in for no apparent reason .  however ,  instead of being suspenseful ,  the kids are saddled with bad dialog and dopey-headed behavior ,  preventing us from really caring about what happens next .  there is also some unintentional humor in this segment .  the third and final story is  " the hitch-hiker "  ,  which is actually a retread re-adapted for creepshow 2 .  the original story ,  by lucille fletcher ,  was filmed in 1953 as a film noir suspense film .  then it was adapted for a famous twilight zone episode featuring inger stevens .   " the hitch-hiker "  works the best out of these three offerings ,  but it's not without its problems either .  lois chiles plays a cheating spouse ,  who ends up running over a hitch-hiker ,  or so she thinks .  however ,  we don't know whether to sympathize with her or condemn her .  as in many average stories of this type ,  the characters exist merely to tell the stories with their twists and turns .  the wrap around story with the bullies seems a bit out of place .  tom savini appears as the  " creep "  in this installment .  the good thing is there haven't been any more sequels .  *1/2 of 4 stars . 
0	this sword-&-sorcery story of an appallingly brutal and callous  " hero "  vanquishing an evil king is worthless in almost every detail .  the acting is horrible from the leads to the supporting roles .  the leering ,  gloating glee with which the director shows the hero smearing blood around is absolutely disgusting ;  nor is it redeemed by any justice to his cause ,  since he is as bad as the people he's fighting .  z-movie editing is abundant ,  including a scene where a character  " dies "  from a sword thrust that very obviously missed completely !   the movie is clearly banking on the charms of the female leads ,  barbi benton and lana clarkson ,  who are paraded around mostly naked throughout the movie .  as a 20-something male ,  i will not pretend that female flesh on the screen doesn't attract me .  but the treatment of their characters is so degrading and the sex scenes so casual and joyless ,  that i couldn't enjoy even this aspect of the movie .   most cheesy movies of this era are at least somewhat redeemed by a light-hearted ,  tongue-in-cheek feel  ( the sequel is better in this regard )  ,  but deathstalker seems to take itself completely seriously as heroic fantasy .  no way !  avoid at all costs !   rating :  1/2 out of **** . 
0	some guy gets whacked .  right out in plain sight this other guy shoots him .  he's got some bodyguards and they whack the killer ,  but a reporter gets interested .  she goes to the hospital where they took the guy who got whacked .  she walks in ,  and corners one bodyguard ,  but he doesn't feel like talking .  i can't figure out why .  it's not like anyone else is interested .  she's the only reporter there .  anyway ,  her editor discourages her from working on this lame story .  but hey ,  she does anyway .  she goes to see the killer's sister & mom .  a few minutes after she leaves they get whacked big time-- somebody blows up their trailer-- huge ball of fire .  then she searches out the bodyguard from the hospital .  she finds him hungover on his boat ,  but a minute later they're both underwater sucking on a scuba tank 'cause three guys are trying to whack them  ( and have blown up the boat big time-- huge ball of fire )  .  the reporter and the bodyguard whack two of the guys who are trying to whack them .    in the course of the next hour another guy gets whacked crossing the street ,  there's a shootout with several stiffs in a warehouse ,  some car chases with wreckage & death ,  a fake suicide ,  etc .  etc .  lotsa stiffs ,  all kindsa carnage .    great stuff ,  but what the reporter and the bodyguard can't figure is :  why in hell the original guy got whacked .  what's the motivation ?  of course ,  it might help us to figure out why the reporter's even interested .  through almost all of this she's the only reporter on the story .  nobody else in the media cares .  not even with all the big fireballs and dead bodies .  true ,  the original guy who got whacked wasn't exactly a celebrity .  his job was a little bit dull .  he was just the president .  yeah ,  the one who lives in the white house .  oh ,  and the bodyguard is a secret service agent .   is that the spoiler ?   it should be .  after all there are no tv cameras ,  no other print reporters ,  no bloggers .  .  .  just another one of those police blotter crimes .  .  .   so what's the spoiler ?   lemme think .  .  .   no !  wait !  the spoiler is that his wife did it !  yeah .  .  .  the first lady .  she was p---ed because the president was fooling around .  and she gets away with it .  she's really sharp ,  huh ?  but how the hell could anybody ever figure that out ?  why would anyone bother ?  after all ,  only one reporter is even interested .    i give this move a  " 1 "  .  it was so dumb i just had to keep watching .  and it only got dumber !  that's the real spoiler !  but even though i've told you ,  you've got to see it to believe it ! 
1	robert stack never really got over losing a best supporting actor oscar for his role as kyle in  " written on the wind "  to anthony quinn's 12-minute performance in  " lust for life .  "  stack plays the deeply disturbed ,  alcoholic son of an oil tycoon .  he has lived his life in the shadow of the friend with whom he was raised ,  mitch ,  played by rock hudson .  they both love the same woman ,  lucy ,   ( lauren bacall )  ,  who becomes kyle's wife .  kyle's sister ,  marylee  ( dorothy malone )  ,  is a drunken slut who's in love with mitch .  their story plays out in glorious color under the able direction of douglas sirk ,  who really dominated the melodrama field with some incredible films ,  including  " imitation of life ,  "   " all that heaven allows ,  "   " magnificent obsession ,  "  and many others .   make no mistake - this is a potboiler ,  and stack and dorothy malone make the most of their roles ,  malone winning a best supporting actress oscar .  there's one amazing scene ,  mentioned in other comments ,  where she wildly dances to loud music as her father collapses and dies on the staircase .  we're led to believe that marylee sleeps with everyone ,  including the guy that pumps the gas ,  because she's in love with mitch .  mitch wants nothing to do with her .  he's so in love with lucy that ,  out of loyalty to kyle ,  he wants to go to work in iran to avoid temptation .  i doubt he'd be so anxious to get there today no matter how much in love he was .   hudson and bacall have the less exciting roles here - hudson's mitch is the good guy who's been cleaning up kyle's messes for his entire life ,  and bacall is mitch's wife who finds herself in a nightmare when her husband starts drinking again after a year of sobriety .  sirk focuses on the more volatile supporting players .   in sirk's hands ,   " written on the wind "  is an effective film ,  and the big scene toward the end in the mansion is particularly exciting .  the director had a gift for this type of movie ,  and though he had many imitators ,  he never had an equal . 
0	i must say that i am fairly disappointed by this  " horror "  movie .  i did not get scared even once while watching it .  it also is not very suspenseful either .  .  .  .  i was able to guess the ending half way through the movie .  .  .  so .  .  what's left ?    " the ring "  is a trully scary movie .  .  .  i wish other movies would stop copying from it  ( e . g .  the trade-mark :  long hair )  .  please give me some originality .   will not recommend this movie . 
0	summer season is here when the choices in the cinemas are limited to what's the hottest movie of the week ,  given 99 . 9% of the screens dedicated to screening it .  ok ,  so i may exaggerate on the percentage ,  but you get my drift .  besides stuff from hollywood ,  bollywood too have their own share of highly anticipated blockbusters ,  and from some of the trailers shown ,  i'm hyped to watch them too .  tashan was billed as one of the most highly anticipated for 2008 ,  but i was quite surprised at the lower than low turnout at the cinemas .  when i watched jodha akbar ,  it was a full house ,  but it wasn't for tashan .   after watching it ,  i knew why .  it was entertaining ,  but it was fundamentally weak .  just like it's literal english title ,  which means  " style "  ,  tashan is all style ,  but little substance .  not that it doesn't have the usual star power ,  but scenes felt forced ,  and some bordered on a tad ridiculous ,  even for bollywood standards i must say .  which is quite surprising given that tashan is directed and written by vijay krishna acharya ,  who wrote dhoom and dhoom 2 ,  both of which i enjoyed tremendously .    in his rookie directorial outing with tashan ,  while you can't fault his direction ,  you'd probably scratch your head over the plot ,  which was clunky at best .  it tried to force too many things into the story ,  though credit be given where it allowed you some avenue to question character motivation ,  but that came a little too late ,  and only toward the finale ,  which left you guessing for just a moment before it latched into full blown action mimicking many a thai action movie ,  with hong kong's wirework and hollywood's ludicrous firearms and gunplay with zero recoil .  and in a bid to include everything including the kitchen sink ,  you have an assortment of vehicles appearing ,  and the one that took the cake ,  in a dhoom 2 homage ,  was the jetski boat in the middle of nowhere .   at best ,  tashan can be enjoyed as unintentional comedy ,  and this is attributed to how the cast hammed up with their characters .  saif ali khan plays jimmy cliff ,  a call center executive who gives english tuition ,  only as a platform for fishing out new girlfriend material .  his playboy ways gets junked aside when he meets with pooja singh  ( kareena kapoor )  ,  who's not exactly who she seems ,  the meek and sweet natured hottie .  she engages jimmy's services for her boss ,  mobster bhaiyyaji  ( anil kapoor )  ,  who probably gets most of the laughs as he speaks broken english and phrases must like how an ah-beng does it .  and to complete the quartet ,  akshay kumar plays bachchan pandey ,  an illiterate gangster for hire who got engaged by bhaiyyaji to hunt down jimmy and pooja when they escape with money stolen from bahiyyaji's business .   so begins a road trip of sorts ,  with friends who turned enemies ,  and enemies whom you know will become friends as the road trip wears on .  jimmy cliff is probably the most implausible of all ,  because he goes from zero to hero ,  executing moves that would shame rambo ,  in absolutely no time ,  which is quite out of character .  kareena kapoor amps up the sex factor as she uses her charms to guile both men ,  and has plenty of opportunity to do so given the much touted bikini scenes ,  and other costumes that boast of plunging necklines or hemlines way above the knee .  every character has a backstory created ,  and i thought akshay kumar's bachchan pandey was probably the best ,  the most touching and the most fun of the lot ,  even though his character seemed a lot like a non-green incredible hulk with his gravity-defying leaps and power packing punches .  his wounds also heal automatically ,  which impressively puts wolverine to shame .  and the best part is his theme song ,  which is damn alpha-male and played in ra-ra mode each time he takes on adversaries .   but sad to say ,  that's the only tune that is memorable ,  something that cheers  " bachchan- pandey-bachchan-pandey "  .  for most bollywood movies i watch ,  i will usually be able to ,  despite the obvious language gaps ,  emerge from screenings humming a tune or two .  i wasn't able to do that after tashan ,  because the songs unfortunately just weren't catchy at all .  usually the song/dance routine works well into the storyline without any necessity to bring the characters out of the current scene or location .  that i enjoy ,  versus plucking them out and plonking them into extreme settings high atop a mountain ,  or atop jagged rocks on the beach front .   tashan probably didn't take itself too seriously ,  but coming from vijay krishna acharya's story ,  you probably wanted something a little more decent rather than the ridiculous ,  and for continuity to be a little more careful as well .  billed as a blockbuster ,  now i can start to understand why the crowds have already shunned this one .  despite akshay kumr stealing the show ,  tashan could have been better on the whole . 
1	spoilers following :  i picked up the book  " evil angels "  when it first came out knowing nothing of the case .  just to give the press and the austrialian people a break here ,  i was quite far into it before i began to question the chamberlain's guilt .  the author obviously intended the reader to understand why the public jumped to the conclusions they did .  john bryson told the story just as it was presented to the jurors  ( and picked up by the press )  of the arterial spray ,  the actelone  (  ?  ?  )  plates ,  dr .  james cameron's certainty that the collar was cut with scissors ,  that a baby could not be taken whole from her clothes with the buttons still done up ,  bloody hand print ,  etc .  all quite convincingly .  after all ,  these were experts in their fields who were testifying with no apparent reason to lie ,  and the fact that the evidence was completely wrong wasn't apparent to me at all .  it was also highly technical evidence ,  difficult for a layman to understand .  to this point ,  beyond some hearsay testimony in the trials ,  hardly anyone had ever heard of a dingo attacking a human ;  people didn't believe it was possible .  the public was suspicious of the seventh day adventists ,  whose origins made them appear to be a cult ,  and all sorts of wild beliefs about them contributed to the appearance of guilt .  were it not for dedicated ,  selfless lawyers who worked relentlessly to investigate and counter the trial testimony ,  finding azaria's clothes later would not have been enough to get lindy out of jail .  the book shook me for that reason ,  and i've been reluctant to come to a conclusion about anyone's guilt ever since  ( excepting oj of course )  .  i was thrilled that a movie was going to be made about the case and don't think it could have been done better .  i've always liked sam ,  who i could identify with completely ,  and meryl was perfect as always .  beautiful photography ,  haunting music .  i think it's not only a very good ,  but a very important ,  movie .  too bad it didn't receive more publicity at the time it was released . 
0	mean spirited ,  and down right degrading adaptation to the classic children's tale not only lacks the charm of its forefather but lacks any talent what so ever .  mike myers should not only be ashamed of himself for his horrible performance that is a clear rip off of what jim carrey did but he should give up acting all together .  he is so annoying that you would want to beat the crap out of him if you were able to jump right in the film .  the sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor .  i have seen a lot of bad film this year ,  but this not only takes the cake but it is with out a doubt one the worse films ever made . 
1	this wartime sitcom written by jimmy perry and david croft ,  who wrote tv's best programme ever dads army ,  was not as good as dads army ,  but still very ,  very funny .   it is about a concert band in india .  most episodes were about bsm williams  ( windsor davies )  trying to get the concert party ,  who he referred to as a bunch of puffs ,  posted up the jungle .  he was always unsuccessful as the vague colonel reynolds  ( donald hewlett )  and the stupid captain ashwood  ( michael knowles )  were big fans of the concert party .  the concert party consisted of bombadier solomans  ( george layton )  ,  ginger rogers impersonator gunner  " gloria "  beaumont  ( melvyn hayes )  ,  university educated piano player gunner  " la de da "  gunner graham ,  a . k . a padarouski  ( john clegg )  ,  singer gunner  " lofty "  sugden ,  gunner parkins  ( christopher mitchell )   ( williams thought parkins was his son ,  he was quite wrong )  ,  big eater gunner  " nosher "  evans and animal impersonator's  ( kenneth macdonald )  ,  he was no percy edwards .  also ,  heavily involved in the adventures were faithful indian servant rangi ram  ( michael bates )  ,  with the char-wallah and the punkah-wallah  ( dino shafeek and babar bhatti )  giving ram wonderful support .    the show ,  just like dads army left many catchphrases .  rangi ram used to say to his punkah wallah  " don't be such clever dickie "  and he ended a lot of the shows saying  " here is a very old hindu proverb e . g when wife is having affair with best friend ,  it doesn't stop your house from catching fire "  it was williams though who had the most catchphrases .  he would always shout  " shuddup !  !  !  !  !  "  ,  say  " oh dear ,  how sad ,  never mind "  and when talking to gunner graham ,  he would always sarcastically talk in a posh accent .   this show doesn't enjoy the same recognition as dads army did .  this is probably due to a question of taste :  this is seen as being crude .  williams is homophobic calling his men  " puffs "  ,  though it has to be said williams is a bore .  also ,  some people think there is a racial element in the humour ,  using the fact that michael bates was blacked up to play rangi ram  ( bates was actually born in india though and spoke urdu before he spoke english )  ,  so the bbc will feel a bit uneasy putting it on ,  even though the vast majority of people who have actually watched the show would agree that the show isn't racist ,  i know someone who is half indian ,  and they weren't the slightest bit offended and agreed like i did that it was a very funny show .  when i see an episode for the first time ,  i laugh probably more than i do for any other sitcom ,  but when i see it second time round ,  i don't laugh all that much ,  but no matter how many times i see dads army ,  i laugh many times in an episode .   best episode :  the road to banu ,  series 1 ,  episode 7
1	dear god where do i begin .  this is bar none the best movie i've ever seen .  the camera angles are great but in my opinion the acting was the best .  why the script writers for this movie aren't writing big budget films i will never understand .  another is the cast .  it is great .  this is the best ted raimi film out there for sure .  i know some of you out there are probably thinking  " no way he has plenty better "  but no your wrong .  raptor island is a work of art .  i hope it should have goten best movie of the year instead of that crappy movie crash with a bunch of no names and no raptors .  i believe this movie is truly the most wonderful thing ever . 
0	this straight-to-video duffer is another nail in the coffin of rick moranis's career .  as is the disney tradition ,  quality is sacrificed in the name of a quick cash-in ;  this is a lazy retread with moranis accidentally shrinking himself and a few relatives so they can repeat all the best scenes from the original movie .  instantly dated visual effects and crummy dialogue abound in this cheesy lamer ,  which did nothing but make me pine for the days of 'the incredible shrinking man' ,  when this kind of thing was done properly .  shockingly ,  this is directed by top cinematographer dean cundey ,  who should either stick to the day job or pick better material next time . 
1	harvey keital's best performance so far the new century .  very nicely photographed ,  a beautiful snap-shot of pre-castro cuba .  the story revolves around the nephew of a local minor crime boss who develops a friendship with an american with hollywood connections .  it's really about the moment when a boy awakens to the fact that the small circle of people he knows actually live in a much larger ,  much more complex world that he doesn't yet understand . the script is strong and filled with humor ,  the direction is crisp .  over all ,  a really professional job that fits in well with the tradition of latin american cinema .  the one weakness is the decision to shoot in sync-sound english rather than spanish - probably to improve sales in the us .  unfortunately ,  this just makes the film a little less convincing .  but if you can see beyond this ,  you will find a heartfelt trip to another world .  recommended . 
0	i'm sure that the folks on the texas/louisiana border must have had a a good laugh or two when paramount's b picture unit inflicted this one on the war time public .  very simply the area along the sabine river where the film opens is cotton country just like the rest of the deep south or at least the deep south was post civl war .  no big cattle empires there ,  they're much farther west in texas ,  farther than richard dix and preston foster could ride to set up their empire .   the film begins with the two of them partners in a riverboat and when leo carrillo tries a theft of their services by not paying them for hauling his cattle ,  they keep the cattle .  and that's the beginning of the big ponderosa like ranch they start .   along the way foster marries dix's sister played by frances gifford and feuds with his much smaller neighbors .  they also have some further run ins with leo carrillo .   anyway ,  us easterners who like westerns usually don't bother with geographical trifles and it's still a good western from the production mill of harry sherman who produced all those hopalong cassidy westerns for paramount .  the climax is a blazing ,  and i mean that literally ,  gun battle that should have maybe been used on an a production .   but i wouldn't have any but western fans look at it . 
0	i wanted to read the other comments before leaving my review and the majority definately rules :  this movie is aweful !  from the acting to the non-realistic animation to the countless errors .  i was actually hoping that the flaps would have been extended by a stretch of the imagination  ( can't extend flaps without engines )  .  the landing gear cannot be lowered unless you have electricity .  that tiny little fan that was going was not sufficient by any stretch to lower the landing gear .  the one thing i thought was quite peculiar is when they landed ,  the back wheels touched down and then the nose one broke off ,  thus suspending the plane with both back tires in the air .  how did the captain apply left and right brakes to tires that weren't touching the ground ?  did they forget the spoilers ?  word to the director :  find out *all* you can about planes before attempting a  " plane "  movie .  sorry for the technical rant ,  but i give this movie 1/10 . 
1	one of the best ensemble acted films i've ever seen .  there isn't much to the plot ,  but the acting- incredible .  you see the characters change ever so subtly ,  undr the influence of the rented villa in italy ,  and love .  and happiness .  the film casts a mesmerizing spell on you ,  much as the villa does on all the women .  truly  " enchanted "  . 
0	this is available on a  " drive in double feature "  from dark sky films ,  and since i just had finished up  " barracuda "  ,  i watched this too .  this is a film that proves to be incredibly ambitious and inept at the same time .   we begin with two young ladies wandering the streets of some foreign town ,  but where exactly are they ?  they stop to look at necklaces from some chinese vendor ,  and try on chinese-style clothes at a shop ,  but then we see some aztec dancers ?  and all the while ,  these girls are being followed by two guys ,  who eventually drop whatever stealth they didn't have to chase the girls on a wild run though the town ,  and they finally catch them .   it seems that one of the girls has a coin on a string around her neck ,  and these guys want to find the loot ,  and where did she get it ?  so ,  in flashback ,  we go back to find out .  and how did they know she had this coin ?  hard to say ,  really .   now ,  back in the day ,  when these two women were 10 years old ,  they were out with their sisters and their sister's boyfriends on a boat ,  and after stopped to get air in their tanks ,  they tow this young boy back to his home dock ,  only to have his grandpa come out & invite the  " young 'uns "  up for herbal tea with granny .  but not everyone has the tea ,  todd has gone back to the boat to check on the young girls ,  and then when they're away from it ,  the boat blows up ,  and when they get back to the house their friends have mysteriously disappeared .  well ,  it seems as though these  " kindly folk "  raise their own vegetables but they wait for the meat to drop by for a spell ,  and serve it herbal tea .   but the girls and todd did leave the island ,  but now ,  they're returning ,  escorted by their captors ,  and they're there to find the treasure ,  despite the fact that no one ever showed the girls where it was before .  there also seems to be someone else on the island ,  and the thugs mysteriously begin to die ,  one by one ,  and since there's only three ,  it doesn't take long .  and there's even a sort of happy ending ,  which will leave the viewer every bit as baffled as they were throughout the rest of the film .   the two thugs seem to be speed freaks with anger issues ,  and combined with no acting ability they're borderline hilarious .  the hillbilly-type family is also devoid of acting ability ,  despite the fact that the grandpa is hank worden ,  who appeared in many films and tv shows .  the action is confusing ,  the locales are even more confusing ,  and the island looks like southern california .   so what the hell is this ?  i'm not sure ,  but it certainly is worth seeing once so you can think  ( or say )  ,  huh ?  4 out of 10 ,  very bizarre . 
0	this early role for barbara shelley ( in fact , her first in britain after working in italy )  , was made when she was 24 years old , and it's certainly safe to say that she made a stunning debut in 1957's  " cat girl .  "  while blondes and brunettes get most of the attention ( i'll always cherish yutte stensgaard )  , the lovely auburn-haired actress with the deep voice always exuded intelligence as well as vulnerability ( one such example being 1960's  " village of the damned ,  "  in which her screen time was much less than her character's husband , george sanders )  . she is the sole reason for seeing this drab update of  " cat people ,  "  and is seen to great advantage throughout ( it's difficult to say if her beauty found an even better showcase )  . her character apparently sleeps in the nude , and we are exposed to her luscious bare back when she is awakened ( also exposed 8 years later in 1965's  " rasputin-the mad monk "  )  . the ravishing gown she wears during most of the film is a stunning strapless wonder ( i don't see what held that dress up , but i'd sure like to )  . all in all , proof positive that barbara shelley , in a poorly written role that would defeat most actresses , rises above her material and makes the film consistently watchable , a real test of star power , which she would find soon enough at hammer's studios in bray , for the duration of the 1960's . 
1	from the beginning of the show carmen was there .  she was one of the best characters .  why did they get rid of her ?  !  the show not the same as before .  its way worse .   the best episodes were with carmen in them .  you can't replace someone from the beginning !  that is like south park without kyle or child's play without chucky !  it's not right !  the niece who replaced her is just ,  ugh !  awful .  she doesn't fit into the storyline at all .  she was one of the main characters ,  and the niece can't replace her .  she was an awesome actress .  way better than the niece .  get her back ,  or you'll lose a ton of viewers . 
1	 " the haunted world of edward d .  wood ,  jr .  "  is the definitive documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as  " glen or glenda "  ,   " bride of the monster "  ,  and ,  of course ,   " plan 9 from outer space "  .  this exquisite film far exceeds where other documentaries ,  such as  " look back in angora "  and  " the plan 9 companion "  ,  failed .  it rounds up his surviving entourage ,  many of whom have passed away since filming ,  and gives an honest examination of ed wood and his work .  nostalgic in the fact that it looks back at the darker corner of yesteryear hollywood ,  sentimental in its treatment of the director  ( down to the haunting music )  ,  this documentary is an absolute must-see for anyone who loves the director who so failed in his day .  the entire two hours of the film lovingly and retrospectively pieces together ed's life and untimely death for the viewer .  best watched at 3 am while wearing an angora sweater . 
0	okay ,  'enjoy' is a pretty relative term ,  but flexibility is in order when you're dealing with a filmmaker of james glickenhaus' calibre .   mcbain is truly one of the most ridiculous ,  over the top action films i've ever seen ,  without the nasty edge of the exterminator .  other reviews have commented on a suspension of disbelief regarding the film's heroic middle aged commandos ,  but how about making a film in the philippines that is set in colombia ?  all the extras are filipino .  in fact the only character who looks remotely hispanic is good ol' victor argo as the much reviled 'el presidente' !  oh yes ,  we also have maria conchita alonso overemoting like crazy as a rebel leader .  there are tons of explosions and bodies flying everywhere in this amusing paean to the glories of american imperialism . 
1	although the movie is clearly dated ,  audiences can still easily identify with the plight of hapless buster in this timeless and very funny underdog tale .  buster fights against unkindly odds in three different ages :  the stone age ,  the roman age ,  and the moden age ,  playing almost the same character with just a change of scenery to help us identify the different  " ages "  .  in this movie we see one of the earliest comedic depictions of the  " caveman "  stereotype ,  who wins his love not by romance but by brute force ,  as well as a funny twist on roman gladiatorial combat ,  two comedic sketches that long predate such spoofs as mel brooks'  " history of the world :  part i "  .  the underlying theme of the movie is simple yet convincing :  although the times may have-a-changed ,  we still face the same struggles even in modern times that we fought in prehistoric times in order to  " win the girl "   ( keep in mind this is the theme of 1923 america ,  a time when chauvinism was still en vogue )  .  it is interesting to look at this movie over eighty years later ,  and consider how dramatically things have changed from this movie's  " modern times "  to now . 
0	i couldn't believe that this movie dates from 2007 ,  it had all the looks of a below-average seventies horror-flick .  didn't they have any knowledge of modern special effects or cgi ?  !  ?  didn't they know that in the post-millennium the violence in a supposed horror- and/or scifi-movie should at least be a little bit graphic ?  or did i get the purpose wrong ,  was it supposed to be a deep and meaningful story of man and animal ,  bound together in the big cycle of life ,  or a warning to mankind not to mess with nature ,  or something like that ?  ?  it doesn't really matter ,  either way it turned out wrong and to me this movie failed on all accounts .   first of all :  the premise is very improbable .  if at a given time you're capable of replacing a total eye ,  no responsible medical scientist would start his very first human attempt with both eyes at the same time ,  that's totally unprofessional .  and to do all this apparently without informed consent of the patient ?  !  and why on earth choose for eyes that have a totally unusual color for humans ,  and make the victim look like a freak ?  !  by the way ,  i noticed that all the real wolves in the movie had puppy-like normal dark eyes ,  couldn't they have waited for such a specimen ?  the story is lame ,  it's about this poor guy aaron who gets these weird eye-transplants ,  which suddenly makes him feel like the donor-wolf  ( or at least ,  that's what i make of it )  and then he's being chased by some military men .  especially this last bit is ridiculous .  i mean ,  i can understand that the army is interested in the results of the experiment  ( imagine soldiers with night-vision eye-sight !  )  but as the operation fails on account of the apparent nervous breakdown of the patient ,  it's beyond me why they're out to kill him .  why not leave him alone and look for another usable recipient ?   ( a volunteering soldier maybe ?  ?  )  .  and why try to kill everyone else that's involved with poor aaron ,  isn't that a bit steep ?  !  who the hell are these militaries anyway ,  i hope not the us army or the government ,  they behave like psychopaths ,  walking around the hospital waving automatic weapons ,  raiding private apartments like they're after some public enemy # 1 ,  and displaying during the ultimate show-down in the woods a total lack of discipline ,  like a bunch of frightened schoolchildren ,  panicking and shooting randomly around .   aaron ,  for some unfathomable medical reason ,  feels like a wolf after the transplantation of the eyes .  why would that be ?  ?  ?  he suddenly sees visions of wandering wolves .  what is this ?  are we supposed to believe that the memories of the donor-wolf are situated in it's eye-balls ?  !  ?  and that the recipient of these eye-balls also adopts the wolf's craving for red  ( life- )  meat and can jump off of a 30 feet high balcony and land unharmed on his all-fours like a cat  ( can a wolf even do that ?  ?  !  )  .   the acting  ( or the lack thereof )  didn't help the credibility of all this either :  everyone stumbles through their lines like wooden dolls ,  especially this indian girl ,  she may be pretty but she can only come up with one expression  ( vexed )  and some disinterested mumblings about the force of nature ,  and it beats me why aaron all of a sudden is all over her  ( but hey ,  there probably had to be at least one love-scene !  )  .  i really sympathized with actor cory monteith ,  who seems like a nice guy with a handsome enough face ,  but they didn't give him much to go with .  he has to run around bare-chested for more than half of the movie ,  which could have been fun to watch ,  but then they had better chosen someone with a more impressive physique ,  monteith really should leave his shirt on .  his  ( few )  killings and attacks are hardly shown ,  we just hear some growling and cries of fear and then there's another victim lying down and aaron with some more blood on his face and chest .  not much for a modern sci-fi horror !  the only good acting came from justine bateman ,  and i really like to see how she has matured into a beautiful and classy forty-something lady .  she did what she could with her silly lines and she even convinced me of being this doctor with good intentions ,  but they made her character a kind of a wimp ,  who gets totally bossed around by the leader of these militaries .  what a pity that the script didn't make her stand up a bit more !    in the end this sums up as being a silly and rather boring movie ,  hardly scary or thrilling ,  with unbelievable goings-on ,  a lot of overlong national geographic-like visuals of wolves running around woods and slopes  ( who cares ?  !  ?  )  ,  some pretentious indian ramblings about man and nature and an uneven musical score with poppy songs at the most inappropriate moments .  i guess the word  " superfluous "  covers it all . 
0	woody allen has made some of the greatest comedies ever and i would seriously consider saying that annie hall is the greatest movie ever but if i really think about it i will probably think of one or two that are better ,  but it would be hard .  he has had of course some films that aren't quite good but not that bad either like manhattan murder mystery and sweet and lowdown but he has never before had a film quite as bad as melinda and melinda .  not quite so tired and so unfunny ,  his films are usually witty and hilarious but how did this happen ,  is it still our good old woody ?  the plot runs around four friends who are having dinner together .  two are play writers and one of the others mentions a funny story that happened to a friend of hers .  it is about a young woman who bursts in on a dinner party unexpected .  we never hear the rest because the two play writes start to debate whether it would make a better comedy or tragedy .  than we begin to see the two points of view .  both center on this woman named melinda who is having trouble both with drugs and with her ex-husband .  in the tragedy she is an old family friend who after attempting suicide decided to show up at her old best friends front door for no apparent reason .  the comedy is about melida who stumbles in on the dinner party after popping 28 sleeping pills .  both go on a wild whirl wind of events that never really make sense or fit together ,  or make you laugh more than once or twice .  there are some nice performances by radha mitchell and will ferrell but they can't fit it together on there own .  they cam't stop it from sinking farther down than most of the other films this year . 
0	as an army veteran ,  i was deeply offended by this film .  in my opinion ,  it is a disgrace to those who fought in the vietnam war .  to say that the real sf soldiers i knew were offended by this crap is an understatement .  if the film were presented as satire or even as a cartoon  ( it was )  ,  it would have been better received .  but it was taken seriously my many people ,  especially overseas .  silly as it sounds ,  wherever i went in europe in the late 80's people seemed to judge me and americans in general by this film .  unrealistic ?  hmm ,  let's see .  a monosyllabic ,  muscle-bound cretin is pulled off a prison work gang to go on a secret mission to se asia to free some american pow's .  in a running battle he kills about 500 enemy soldiers with an m-60 machine gun that never runs out of ammo and never overheats .  and he never misses ,  running with a 32lb gun held up with one arm .  i could go on ,  but i'm getting a headache .  i gave this a 2/10 only because it's slightly better than rambo iii . 
0	after watching this ,  i had lost a little respect for christopher lee  ( this has passed over time )  .  this film was utter garbage .  first ,  they tried to recreate the ending from the first  " howling ,  "  with incredibly bad make-up .  then they try to turn it into a sad excuse of a werewolf porn film !  the plot sucks and the whole film is just awful !  !  !  !  a brother of a werewolf victim from the first film  ( from the look of it ,  it was supposed to be dee wallace stone ) teams up with lee and another woman to destroy the group of werewolves ,  lead by sybil danning ,  who seems to be naked all the time .   this is not even worth renting  ( unless you want to waste your time and money watching the nudity .  )  .  try to catch it on cable instead .  it would be so chopped up ,  it may actually make sense . 
1	well i don't personally like rap ,  but i still found fear of a black hat hilarious .  i'm sure i didn't get some inside jokes ,  but some i knew ,  and it was funny enough to make me laugh just after i'd stopped laughing .  i'm a big fan of spinal tap ,  so naturally i had to check this out .  it was deriviative from this is spinal tap ,  sometimes blatantly ,  but this film still stood on it's own as an original ,  intelligent ,  and funny satire .  my personal favorite :   " back in the time of slaves ,  they didn't have hats to protect them from the sun ,  so at the end of the day they were too tired to revolt .  now we have hats .  " 
1	it does seem like this film is polarizing us .  you either love it or hate it .  i loved it .   i agree with the comment ( s )  that said ,  you just gotta  " feel "  this one .   also ,  early in the film ,  tom cruise shows his girlfriend a painting done by monet--an impressionist painter .  monet's style is to paint in little dabs so up close the painting looks like a mess ,  but from a distance ,  you can tell what the subject is .  cruise mentions that the painting has a  " vanilla sky "  .  i believe this is a hint to the moviegoer .  this movie is like that impressionist painting .  it's impressionist filmmaking !  and it's no coincidence that the title of the movie refers to that painting .   this is not your typical linear plot .  it requires more thought .  there is symbolism and there are scenes that jump around and no ,  you're not always going to be sure what's going on .  but at the end ,  all is explained .   you will need to concentrate on this movie but i think people are making the mistake of concentrating way too hard on it .  after it ends is when you should think about it .  if you try to figure it out as it's unfolding ,  you will overwhelm yourself .  just let it happen .  .  .  " go "  with it .  .  . keep an open mind .  remember what you see and save the analysis for later .   i found all the performances top notch and thought it to be tremendously unique ,  wildly creative ,  and spellbinding .   but i will not critize the intelligence of those of you who didn't enjoy it .  it appeals to a certain taste .  if you like existential ,  psychedelic ,  philosophical ,  thought-provoking ,  challenging ,  spiritual movies ,  then see it .  if you prefer something a little lighter ,  then skip it .   but if you do like what i described ,  then you will surely enjoy it . 
1	by dane youssef    " coonskin "  is film ,  by the one and only ralph bakshi ,  is reportedly a satirical indictment of blaxploitation films and negative black stereotypes ,  as well as a look at life black in modern america  ( modern for the day ,  i mean--1975 )  .  paramount dropped it like a hot potato that just burst into flame .   but this is a bakshi film ,  controversial ,  thrilling ,  and a must-see almost by definition alone .  not just another random  " shock-jock "  of a movie which tries to shock for the sake of shock .  it's by ralph bakshi .  anyone who knows the name knows that if he made a movie ,  he has something big to say .  .  .   although it's roots are based in cheap blaxploitation ,   " coonskin "  isn't just another campy knock-off of mainstream white film or any kind of throwaway flick .   " coonskin "  wants to be more .  it aims it's sights higher and fries some much bigger fish .   the movie doesn't just poke fun at the genre .  nor does it just indict black people ,  but actually seems to show love ,  beauty and heart in the strangest places .    " coonskin "  tells a story out of some convicts awaiting a jail-break .  the fact that it's even possible to break out of a prison in the  " coonskin "  world alone makes it old-fashioned .   one of the inmates tells a story about a trio of black brothers in harlem named brother bear ,  brother rabbit ,  preacher fox who want respect and a piece of the action and are willing to get it by any means necessary .  the itallian mob is running all the real action .   big name black musicians star :  barry white and scatman crothers ,  as well as charles gordone ,  the first black playwright to take home the pulitzer .  something big is happening here obviously .   the movie plays out like a descent into this world ,  this side of the racial divide .  from an angry ,  hip ,  deep ,  soulful black man with a hate in his heart and a gun in his hand .   bakshi's films never know the meaning of the word  " sublety .  "  this one looks like it's never even heard of the word .  but maybe a subject like this needs extremism .  real sledgehammer satire .  some subjects can't be tackled gently .   bakshi is god-dammed merciless .  here ,  no member or minority of the harlem scene appears unscathed .   the characters here are  " animated "  to  " real "  all depending on what the mood and situation are .  the animated characters and the human ones all share the same reality and are meant to be taken just as literally .   bakshi never just shows ugly caricatures just for shock value .  he always has something to say .  nor is black-face is gratuitously .  here ,  unlike in spike lee's  " bamboozled ,  "  he seems to be using it to try and really say something .   like 99 . 9% of all of bakshi's films ,  this one incorporates animation and live-action .  usually at the same time .  bakshki isn't just being gimmicky here .  all of this technique is all intertwined ,  meshing together while saying something .   somehow ,  this one feels inevitably dated .  many of these types of films  ( bakshi's included )  are very topical ,  very spur of the moment .  they reflect the certain trend for the day ,  but looking back of them years later ,  there's just an unmistakable feeling of nostalgia  ( as well as timeless truth )  .   even though the music ,  clothes ,  slang and the city clearly looks like photos that belong in a time capsule ,  the attitude ,  the spirit and the heart remain the same no matter what f--king ear it is .  anyone who's really seen the movies ,  the state of things and has been in company of the people know what i'm talking about .   even some of the of the black characters are a bunny  ( junglebunny )  ,  a big ol' bear and a fox .  one of the most sour and unsavory racist characters is a dirty harlem cop who's hot on the trail of these  " dirty n-----s "  after the death of a cop .  but for him ,  it's not just business .  nor is it for the rest of the brothers who wear the shield .  it's just pure sadistic racist pleasure of hurting blacks .   the sequence involving the godfather and his lady is one of the most moving pieces in the whole film ,  of which there are many .  it plays out like an opera or a ballet .   the promo line :  warning :   " this film offends everybody !  "  this is not just hype .  proceed with extreme caution .   you have been warned .  .  .   by dane youssef
0	the main character lance barton gets killed and to heaven before his time .  when heaven learns about the mistake he is given the body of just deceased rich old and white mr .  wellington .   a young black guy in a old white mans body still behaving like the young black man is maybe funny if you see it done by an old white actor .  in this movie i ended up reminding myself several times :   " chris rock is supposed to be an old white guy "  .   the whole concept does not play as intended :  the  " illusion "  is not transported well and the love story is not believable at all .  the fact that all you see is chris rock playing a young black guy ,  because the old white person everyone is supposed to see is only shown in small scenes ,  is to much of a challenge for the viewers  " suspension of disbelief "  . 
1	absolutely wonderful drama and ros is top notch .  .  . i highly recommend this movie .  her performance ,  in my opinion ,  was academy award material !  the only real sad fact here is that universal hasn't seen to it that this movie was ever available on any video format ,  whether it be tape or dvd .  they are ignoring a very good movie .  but universal has little regard for its library on dvd ,  which is sad .  if you get the chance to see this somewhere  ( not sure why it is rarely even run on cable )  ,  see it !  i won't go into the story because i think most people would rather have an opinion on the film ,  and too many  " reviewers "  spend hours writing about the story ,  which is available anywhere .   a 10 ! 
0	the plot of corpse grinders 2 is very much similar to the original corpse grinders ,  what is left that is different from the other film consists of weird aliens .   it is my belief that this film would be the #1 worst film on imdb - if anyone had actually watched it .  the plot is disconnected and ,  in several  ( way too many )  instances ,  makes absolutely no sense whatsoever .  the real wonder here is why in the world was this sequel created to such an unsuccessful and horrendous  ( but still somewhat better )  film .   i would highly recommend this film if you enjoy watching terrible movies for a good laugh . 
0	saw this movie in an early preview ,  and i cannot stress enough how bad i thought this film was .  from the very beginning ,  the audience was groaning over pacino's awful southern accent .  poor al looked really ,  really haggard ,  and i can't decide whether this was purposely part of his role as a drug addicted publicist ,  or perhaps he just didn't get any sleep before coming to the set .  much worse than pacino's close ups ,  however ,  is the wretched excuse for a plot .  early in the film we are given indications that pacino's character is gay ,  and i suspect that is what the screenwriter had originally intended .  later ,  however ,  we are supposed to suspend our incredulity and believe that both tea leoni and kim basinger  ( both of whom are sleepwalking through lame roles )  lust after this elderly ,  half dead looking ,  effeminate man with the ridiculous accent .  the worst part overall was the main plot thread ,  which had to do with some corporate espionage that is never fully explained and we never ,  ever care about in the slightest .  because this was a preview i will reserve my final judgment ,  because of the possibility of re-shoots and editing ,  but you can bet i will not pay a cent to see this in theaters . 
0	oh god , what an idiotic movie ! incredibly cheap with fake special effects ( the creature is played by one guy in lame costume ) and stupid plot . all dialogues are unbelievably bad and these actors ( ha ! ha ! ha !  )  .  .  . they're simply ludicrous . for example i have never seen so annoying characters like in this junk ( these dumb kids or pregnant woman with his husband and many more )  . all in all , this is a great entertainment if you're drunk . avoid it like the plague . am i drunk ? i don't think so .  .  . 
0	in a movie that follows a struggling actor ,  played ,  evidently ,  by a struggling actor ,  this does no favours for chris klein .  he struggles to bring anything memorable to the role and meanders on through the shallow script managing to display ,  what could only be described as ,  a bland leading man .  the story exists ,  but that is all ,  and fails to show any basic start ,  middle and end and the viewer is left shrugging his shoulders feeling as though nothing in the past hour and three quarters has really happened .   one bright light in the midst of this is fred durst ,  who manages to stand out above his seemingly averagely talented co-stars and does a semi-decent job of bringing the backward character of legde to life .  whether fred can re-create this when working with a higher calibre of cast remains to be seen but i'l be watching out for him in future . 
1	such energy and vitality .  you just can't go wrong with busby berkley films and this certainly must be his best .  of course the choreography is wonderful ,  but also the banter between cagney and blondell is so colorful and such a delight .  don't miss this one . 
0	and that comes from someone that will withstand almost any viewing .  the acting and sound is awful .  this might qualify for a  " so bad it's good "  point of merit ,  ,  , for some .  however i take my horror movies seriously and this is just crap-it's just soooo cheap ,  i think that's my major complaint .  the dialogue is often hilarious-attention to how many times  " you startled me "  is used .  the  " child "  actress is seriously god awful-i pray her acting career ended here .  . her line  " donuts !  i hate donuts "  is worth repeated viewing however . 
1	while this movie has many flaws ,  it is in fact a fun '80s movie .  eddie murphy peaks during his 80's movies here .  while his character is indistinguishable from earlier movies ,  his timing is almost flawless with perfect partners and foils .   couple this with the hypnotic beauty of charlotte lewis ,  this makes for a fun rainy day action-comedy flick .   
1	despite the title ,  the sword bearer ,  and the dvd cover  ( action/herioc poses of the sword bearer )  this is not a super hero film .    ( minor spoilers )  it follows the tale of sasha ,  the sword bearer ,  who is cursed with having a retractable sword in his forearm .  cool you say ,  but no ,  this is real life .  if you had this power as a child could you control it when ,  say ,  faced by a mad man ,  or when your mum's boyfriend is beating her .  and if you don't control it ,  how do you cope with being a two time killer at the age of 12 .   this essentially is where sasha is when we meet him .  wandering aimlessly after another killing  ( much like a bout de soufflé )  .  he then meet katya ,  and the pair fall instantly in love ,  providing sasha with a real reason to live and try and changes his ways .  however ,  his past is still chasing him ,  in the form of two police officers .   that is essentially the story ,  and there is virtually no action on screen ,  though a lot if suggested .   i really like this movie .  unlike many hollywood 'super hero' films ,  we get very little back story ,  there is no bad guy  ( unless you count the sword bearer himself )  abut there is a lot of heart and good character development .   worth checking out if you can find it . 
1	loved the movie .  loved the two families crossing paths in history .  only question is if sam gets killed then how does his family's line continue ?  he is madame zeroni's son and zero is supposed to be related but no mention of any other children ?  hmmmmmmmmm .  never mentioned any other children or wife prior to his speaking with and falling in love with the teacher ?  maybe she had a child prior to becoming the kissing kate bandit ?  even with the mistakes in the movie .  just loved it .  the acting was great .  not sure where the story was with mr .  sir being marion a women at the end but makes his character even funnier .  the other  " counseler "  did seem concerned for the kids but of course maybe not so much .  poor warden must have had a really stinky childhood to be so mean when she grew up . 
1	the opening sequence alone is worth the cost of admission ,  as cheech and chong drag that big ol garbage can across the parking lot ,  filled with gas .   " don't spill it man  !  "  ,  hilarious stuff .  and then ,  as 'the plot' ensues ,  you're in for one heck of a ride .  i watched this film recently and it holds up ,  being just as funny upon each viewing .  check it out . 
0	firstly ,  there are some good things about this film ,  but it's all cliche slasher stuff combined with a teen movie .  in the advertising of this movie ,  that i've seen ,  a large emphasis was on the fact that denise richards is in it ,  but she's a poor actress ,  and not as good looking as people try to make her out to be  ( not that that has anything to do with the movie )  .  and what's with that look she gives everyone ?  perhaps it's part of the character ,  but like i said ,  the acting .  .  .  still ,  the writing is fine .  you know who it is all throughout the movie ,  and you can almost predict what is about to happen ,  but not in an irritating way .  i think the book it's based on is probably good ,  judging by the plot line ,  but next time i'll read the book to find out rather than watch this . 
0	the only reason to give this movie even a single star is how much the ending made me laugh .  i had high hopes as i usually love bad campy holiday horror movies ,  but this just didn't qualify .  it's really just a bad attempt at showing a character slide slowly into insanity ,  which again ,  isn't a bad plot ,  but is done poorly here .  there are some scenes  ( such as the ending )  which are not intended to be funny ,  but actually made me laugh out loud .  there were a couple of times when i thought the movie would actually go in an interesting direction ,  but it never fulfills what it could and should be .  in my opinion ,  if you are looking for a christmas slasher flick ,  try silent night ,  deadly night . 
0	i have seen about a thousand horror films .   ( my favorite type )  this film is among the worst .  for me ,  an idea drives a movie .  so ,  even a poorly acted ,  cheaply made movie can be good .  something weird is definitely cheaply made .  however ,  it has little to say .  i still don't understand what the karate scene in the beginning has to do with the film .  something weird has little to offer .  save yourself the pain ! 
0	ming the merciless does a little bardwork and a movie most foul ! 
1	the acting is pretty cheesy ,  but for the people in this area up in the 80s and are now detroit area automotive engineers ,  this is a great movie .  i even work with a japanese supplier so that makes this movie even more funny .   jay leno was showing his age last night on the tonight show !  he looks pretty young here .  .  . 17 years ago .  the opening scene ,  with the drag race on what appears to be woodward ave was great .   leno also owns some bad a** cars now ,  it would e great to see a remake of this with his modern collection .  i'm sure the blown vette in the opening scene was his own car .   typical 80s movie .  watch it and enjoy .  no computer generated crap ! 
0	terrible !  !  !  i don't want to be too negative but this film has an iq of stupid monkey . what a disaster . i just couldn't believe how bad this movie is . the dialogs are just very strange and off topic , the camera work at times just horrible , the music at times like a soundtrack for lawrence of arabia , i just watched this film to see how much worse it can get . some of the side kick  " actors "  are total disaster . sorry but all my thumbs and toes and anything that can hang downwards on my body is falling to the ground .  harvey keitle is a great actor but who knows maybe he is in financial crunch to take a part in such a fiasco film .   .   .   .   .  this movie should have been presented to all the students in all the film schools just to teach them a lesson of how not to make a film
0	dull haunted house thriller finds an american family moving into a 200 year old house in japan where a violent murder suicide love triangle occurred .    novel setting is about the only element of interest in this very slow moving horror flick by the director of motel hell .  the film generates zero suspense and is composed of somewhat choppy scenes that rarely seem to be leading anywhere overall .    one obvious example is a fairly early scene where the male lead visits a temple after realizing that his house is haunted as the monk had earlier warned .  the monk recounts the history of the house  ( which the viewer is already familiar with from the opening sequence )  and then the film simply cuts away to something else .  earlier the monk had offered to help .  well ,  where is the help ?  the family continues to stay in the haunted house as things get worse and worse and no mention of the monk is made until nearly the very end when he turns up again to do what he should have done an hour earlier--try to drive the spirits out of the house ,  although by this time it's difficult for the viewers to care .   there are some  ( probably )  unintentional campy laughs in seeing the american actors at the end become possessed by the japanese spirits and suddenly start doing bad martial arts ,  i say probably because the scene is more than a little reminiscent of the chainsaw duel from the same director's motel hell which was more obviously meant to be amusing ,  but on the whole this is a forgettable dud . 
1	yes ,  the cameras were in the right place at the right time .  it's so interesting to see how a world leader  ( like chavez )  who supports the poor people in his country ,  can be held in such low esteem in the us .  his worst  " sin "  ,  in my opinion ,  is caring about those who are at the bottom of the barrel .  what can be so bad about that ?  i have always been fascinated by the us government+media reaction to fidel castro .  at first ,  castro was a good guy  ( around 1959 )  when he supplanted batista .  soon ,  however ,  castro started turning the corporations in cuba toward the needs of the poor instead of the fat cats .  we're a decent country ,  but why does our media and government have such a problem with sharing with the poor ?  if these guys are  " dictators ,  "  then we could use more  " dictatorships "  especially where the poorest of the poor live in the world . 
0	as is often the case ,  films about self-loathing characters do not usually make for good drama .  'downloading nancy' is no exception .  it's supposedly based on a true story about a woman who's murdered at her own request by someone she meets over the internet .   the protagonist is nancy  ( maria bello )  who is married to albert  ( rufus sewell )  .  albert is a successful software developer who has developed a golf game which his company has successfully marketed to various bars and bar/restaurants .  unlike most human beings ,  albert has virtually no positive attributes  ( except for his ability to be successful in the business world )  .  throughout the film ,  albert has a grim and dour expression on his face .  he has no sympathy for his wife with all her emotional problems and resorts to patronizing prostitutes .  when his wife asks for sex ,  he punishes her by masturbating in her presence instead .   nancy is equally one-note as a character .  not only has she had a loveless 15 year marriage but was sexually abused by her uncle when she was growing up  ( thankfully there are no flashbacks of that back story in the film )  .  her self-loathing takes the form of self-mutilation and a result ,  she's forced into therapy .  however ,  she has such contempt for her therapist that no progress can be made .   finally ,  nancy is so depressed that she contacts louis over the internet .  he's sort of a sadomasochistic gigolo ,  who has sex with women for money while inflicting massive amounts of pain to boot .  it's revealed that louis has two children but no longer sees them  ( the children's mother no longer wants anything to do with him )  .   nancy's plan is to first have painful sex with louis and then have him kill her .  there's a particularly unpleasant scene where louis has sex with nancy while slashing her vaginal area with a broken piece of glass .  these scenes are shown as flashbacks after louis pays a visit to albert who ties him up and strikes him with a golf club .  it seems that louis has a two-fold plan in going to see albert :  1 )  berate him for his treatment of nancy and 2 )  enjoy the beating he receives .  it takes awhile before louis will reveal nancy's fatefirst ,  he forces albert to do him the favor of taking his dog to a relative so someone will care for it in the future .  nancy's fate of course is that louis finally ended up choking her to death  ( but showed some hesitation first as he made it clear that he had some 'feelings' for her )  .  we soon learn that louis is imprisoned for life for nancy's murder .   what exactly are we to take away from a film such as downloading nancy ?  are we supposed to feel sorry for victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence ?  is that the main point of the film ?  is sympathy for nancy actually warranted ?  i don't think so .  the film's writers create a straw man in the character of albertsomeone who is so cut off from his emotions that he is the one that is held responsible for nancy's decline .  but are people so one-dimensional in real life ?  i think not .  they have the repulsive louis ,  a man who makes a living by inflicting pain ,  come over and berate albert for neglecting nancy .  furthermore ,  his expressions of love towards nancy  ( before he kills her )  ,  is supposed to show his 'sensitive side' .   in the end ,  it matters little whether the filmmakers have defined where their sympathies lie with the various characters in the film .  they are so bent on titillating their audience with scenes of gratuitous violence ,  that downloading nancy becomes nothing more than an exercise in poor taste and soft pornography . 
0	 " scary movie 2 "  is a let down to the scary movie franchise .  scary movie 1 ,  3 and 4 were all good but this one was kind of boring and not very funny .  luckily they picked their act up after this one and made two more great scary movies .   this film is about a group of teens who get tricked by their professor into going to a haunted mansion for a night .  things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escape .   this movie isn't horrible but they could have improved quite a few things .  it is a bit of fun and if you liked the other movies in the scary movie franchise then give this a watch - but i don't think you will like it nearly as much . 
0	a different look at horror .  the styling differences between american and russian films is interesting .  however from my american perspective this movie just wasn't that good .  the protagonist ,  marie played by anastasia hille wasn't a pleasant character and i had a hard time identifying with her .  she was disagreeable most of the time and confused for much of what little time was left .  also too much time was spent in bringing her to the main location of the film .  then a long time passed before any real suspense built up .  once that happened it seemed volume was used as the main effect which was more annoying than anything else .  the concept was more original than most direct-to-video movies and they didn't use sex to make up for a thin plot .  all in all i'd recommend it for renting ,  but not for theater goers . 
1	despite what others had said  ( *cough* )  ,  this is my favourite movie of all time .  i don't know how long i had been waiting to see it ,  but once i finally did ,  i immediately fell in love .  sure ,  it's strange ,  but that just gives it more of an exciting flavour .  for those who don't know ,  moonchild is one of gackt and hyde's first movies .  they haven't done very many at all ,  maybe 3 or 4 tops each .  so ,  give them some credit .  we all know that adam sandler wasn't the best at first either .  i do believe that they do throw some odd situations in there ,  but i over look that to find the best points of this movie ,  the emotions displayed and whatnot .  therefore ,  i have given ,  and always shall give ,  this movie a 10 out of 10 . 
1	the scenes are fast-paced .  the characters are great .  i love anne-marie johnson's acting .  i really like the ending .    however ,  i was disappointed that this movie didn't delve deeper into achilles's and athena's relationship .  it only blossomed when they kissed each other . 
1	not a bad film .  somehow i was made to actually root for the iranians to win the game played in the movie even though i don't know anything about soccer and am not a fan .  the ending on the bus was exhilarating .   the film itself deals with the issue of women in iran ,  and how they are not allowed to go into sporting arenas amongst men because their swearing is inappropriate for women to hear .  despite this law ,  some women try to sneak in ,  but many of them get caught and detained .  it's really astonishing that any society could still have such antiquated notions of gender .  in an interview ,  panahi says his films are documents of history and its injustices ,  and that one day in the future we can watch these movies and see how iran once lived .  one hopes that future will come sooner rather than later . 
0	though the movie may have been  " true "  to lewis's book  ( in that the script was basically word-for-word ,  verbatim )  ,  it failed to capture any of the grandeur that would otherwise be associated with an epic story like this .  the mythical creatures  ( unicorns ,  centaurs ,  griffins ,  ghouls ,  ghosts )  are *drawn* in ,  and as in the previous review ,  the green-screen flying sequence was very hard to swallow .  i nearly laughed to death when i saw the humanoid beavers with their giant stiff suits and buck teeth ;  i nearly cried when i heard the wolf's  " howl-- "  a man in a grey fuzzy suit basically shrieking as loudly and as girlishly as he possibly could .   all of the acting is tremendously forced ,  especially that of little lucy penvensie .  .  .  i could only take so much indignation ,  desperation ,  and buck teeth in the  ( what felt like )  fourteen hours of watching the movie .  the actress who plays the white witch ,  in all her histrionics ,  seems that she'd be more at home on stage ,  where a booming voice ,  spread arms ,  and a valiant effort at something shakespearian would be more than welcome .    the sets feel claustrophobic ,  whether the scenes are taking place indoors or outdoors .  indoors ,  it's as if bbc could only afford to spend $100 on constructing a set ,  and so it is very small ,  and all the characters are constantly huddled together .  the white witch's castle is a run-down ,  rotting countryside english castle filled with styrofoam statues and bad lighting .  when the penvensie children are wandering through the woods-- actually ,  *any* scene in the woods-- feels like they are simply wandering around in circles .    the only thing that looks decent in the film is aslan ,  but you can bet that bbc probably blew the film's entire budget on building the mechanical feline .  it looks great when it's standing still and before it starts speaking ,  but once it starts moving ,  you can't help but pity the poor man who has to be the rear-end in the lion suit .    yes ,  if you are a hardcore narnia fan ,  you may want to see this version ,  simply because it preserves every word that lewis ever wrote-- but lewis was certainly no screenwriter ,  and a lot of the dialogue feels chunky and awkward when on screen .  during the scene in which the children are at the beavers' and getting ready to flee from the wolves ,  mrs .  beaver's incessant ,   " oh ,  just one more thing ,  dearies ,  and then we will be ready to go ,  "  punctuated by the children's simultaneous cries and sighs and moans of  " no ,  mrs .  beaver ,  please !  "  -- a scene of comic relief ,  so incongruous  ( they are supposed to be fleeing from imminent danger ,  not wondering about whether to pack the sewing machine or not )  ,  detracts from the drama that the scene might otherwise have .  in fact ,  the whole movie is peppered with directing faux pas such as these .    i would recommend seeing the new narnia  ( disney 2005 )  .  the new movie ,  with updated effects ,  spectacular computer animation ,  great timing all around ,  and a gorgeous and scene- stealing white witch  ( who plays her part with all the subtle evil of a seasoned politician ,  as opposed to a shrieking banshee )  captures all of the grandeur and the magnificence of the world of narnia without detracting the least bit from lewis's original vision  ( i think )  .  lucy is a lot cuter  ( no buck teeth ,  yay !  )  ,  as are the beavers  ( and realistically-sized )  ,  and bratty bbc edmund has nothing on the divine ,  desperately-hungry-for-acceptance-insecure-and- angsting-with-an-inferiority-complex edmund that the new disney version fronts .    unless you're the type who enjoys wasting time by making fun of campy movies ,  i would not recommend this film to anyone . 
1	as i said in my comment about the first part :  these two movies are better than most science fiction fans confess .   the scenario in the second movie is not that moving as we don't see the destruction of human civilization ,  but the aftermath ,  thousands of refugees fleeing in tiny space cans ,  protected by only one powerful spaceship .   but when battlestar pegasus appears ,  the story heats up ,  carrying the battle back to the cylon planets .  okay ,  it has a little bit of mad max because all they fight for is fuel for their spaceships to travel on to find the distant earth ,  but it works for me .  it is thrilling science fiction entertainment featuring fine actors and decent special effects  ( even though those tend to repeat themselves ,  to say the least  : - )   )  .   i would have loved a continuation with starbuck and apollo on board .  instead ,  we got a second sequel with no name characters who proved that the story had worked before especially because the feature characters were so well-chosen .  .  .   so thumbs down for the productions of 1980 ,  but thumbs up for the two movies from 1978 . 
1	new york i love you is full of love and power .  not for everybody ,  however ,  but is a beautiful movie .   it has the likes of shia labeouf  ( seen in transformers ,  disturbia ,  charlies angels ,  i robot ,  indiana jones ,  and many more )  ,  maggie q ,  kevin bacon ,  blake lively ,  natalie portman ,  and many more .  with a star-studded cast ,  this movie is without a doubt ,  brilliant .   from many top-notch directors around the world ,  it does not fail to impress .  the diversity from one story to another is creative and unique .   it is safe to say that new york i love you is a popcorn movie ,  and should be watched on a big tv !  this time ,  trust the imdb rating ,  because it is an excellent film .   eagerly waiting shanghai i love you in 2010 .    watch ny ily ,  you won't be disappointed . 
1	mesmerizing ,  breathtaking and horrifying ,  this hauntingly beautiful film is the  " apocalypse now "  without fiction .  slow in pace ,  quiet in mood ,  it gives good glimpses of the poisoned patches of earth that may well be signs of an inevitable doom .   there is no doubt in my mind -- the nature is plagued and we are the disease .  greed ,  the very essence of humanity that drives evolution and progress ,  has turned us into something like cancer ,  on its way to consume the host and die with it .  .  .   manufactured landscapes is quite an unforgettable viewing experience - at least i'll never regard my toaster and iron the same way again . 
1	i enjoyed this movie as a kid when it came out ,  and to this day still do .  a simple story involving the search for a kidnapped girl and an adventurer literally straight out of paperback lore .  it has actors that were more recognizable back in the day .  this shouldn't keep the viewer from giving it a whirl .  wayne crawford stars as the main character jake speed .  sure ,  it might bite from certain elements of romancing the stone ,  and indiana jones .  but this movie is done well enough to keep it out of the cellar .  i am surprised not too many people know about it .  it must have been overshadowed by other movies in the theaters back in '86 .  i watched it back then on cable tv .  it might be hard to find since it's out of print on both vhs and dvd .  i managed to get a dvd from ebay at less than 8 bucks !  cool flick . 
0	watched this with my girlfriend after stumbling over it while zaping channels .   i guess we both hoped for some kind of happy family cute christmas movie ,  but were extremely disappointed .   the actor playing the soldier ,  seems to have 0 emotion whatsoever ,  his face looks the same ,  whether he's chopping down christmas tree's ,  seeing the girl he loves being kissed by her boyfriend ,  or when he's happily surprised by the girl he loves ,  he's an awful actor ,  and at no pont did any of us do nothing but laugh at him .   then there's the cute blond girl ,  blessed with the ability to count dot's and cheat on her boyfriend ,  what a catch !  and her ambition in life is to live with her parents and count more dots .   so it's basically a story about a guy without any emotion or feelings who falls for a guy who count dots and cheats on her boyfriend ,  it's as predictable as it get's ,  and really a waste of time ,  you gain nothing by watching this ,  other than some weird laughs ,  because it's all so corny .   i love it when her dad says that he only eats french fries and not french wine ,  and they all laugh ,  that's the hillbilly attitude this movie is about ,  furthermore ,  if my girlfriends dad were bossing me around like ,  i'd tell him a thing or to ,  but not our army veteran ,  no sir ,  he let's everyone boss him around .   the movie is what first blood would have been ,  if john rambo were burn like the biggest wimp in the world . 
0	i have two good things to say about this film :  the scenery is beautiful and peter falk gives a good performance  ( considering what he had to work with in terms of dialog and direction )  .  however ,  that said ,  i found this film extremely tiresome .  watching paint dry would have been more entertaining .  it seemed much longer than 97 minutes .  beginning with opening sequence ,  where everyone is talking over each other and paul reiser is repeating everything that's said to him on the phone ,  the movie is annoying .  the film is filled with clichés and shtick ,  not to mention endless incidents of audible flatulence by falk .  also ,  the director seems to have had difficulty deciding whether to aim for laughs or tears .  there are some sequences that are touching ,  but they're all played for laughs .  if schmaltzy ,  sentimental ,  and  " cute "  appeal to you ,  you'll love it .  but if you were hoping for something with more substance ,  see a different movie . 
1	i've had a lot of experience with women in russia ,  and this movie portrays what a lot of them are like ,  unfortunately .  they are very cunning ,  ruthless ,  and greedy ,  as well as highly unfair .  from the robotic sex ,  the hustling for gifts ,  to the lies and betrayal ,  i've experienced it all in russia .   i know what i'm talking about .  and here are my qualifications :  here are the photojournals of my three trips to russia in search of a bride .  it includes thousands of pics of many hot russian girls i met ,  black comedy ,  scams i was privy to ,  and the story of my mugging and appearance on russian national tv .   http : //www . happierabroad . com/photojournals . htm  it's like reality tv .  you will love it .  i spent a ton of time putting it together .  so check it out .  the russian woman that nicole kidman plays is a lot like the julia and katya in my photojournals .   my 3 bride seeking trips in russia happen to be very exciting and would sell ,  so why don't they make a movie out of my bride seeking adventures in russia ?  however ,  there is one factual impossibility in this film ,  and that is the way which the guy orders his bride from a catalog and having her arrive at an airport .  it doesn't work that way at all ,  so i don't understand why the media likes to perpetuate this .  there isn't a single russian bride introduction website that works this way ,  and i challenge anyone to find one that does .  the fact is ,  you can only order the russian lady's contact info  ( email ,  address ,  phone number ,  etc .  )  from the website .  from there ,  you correspond and then visit her ,  and if you want to bring her to your country ,  you start the immigration process at your ins office ,  and wait months after that .  that's how it works in real life .  you can't just order her to arrive at your airport .  us immigration would never allow such a thing to happen .   wumaster   - i got everything i wanted by going abroad !  you can too !  http : //www . happierabroad . com
0	i had absolutely nothing to do the past weekend ,  and tagged along with my friends to check out a movie .  .  . any movie .  and since the only movie we'd not seen was inspector gadget ,  we decided to go in for that .   big mistake .  this is a movie that might appeal only to kids .  oh ,  and it's not like i don't enjoy movies targeted at the younger audience .  but this movie had absolutely nothing to hold my attention .  if you have nothing to do at home ,  go to sleep .  better than wasting hard-earned cash on this .  go check out the film if you're a kid or if you're a parent with a kid  :  ) 
0	ah ,  bait .  how do i hate thee ?  let me count the ways .  1 .  you try to be funny ,  but are corny and unenjoyable ;  every joke is predictable and expected ,  and when it comes ,  does not inspire laughter .  instead ,  i want to hurl .  2 .  you try to be dramatic ,  but are unbelievable ;  the woman overacts to a terrible degree ,  and the  " bad guy "  looks like bill gates ,  and is about as scary as .  .  . well ,  bill gates .   ( just try to imagine bill gates trying to intimidate somebody with a gun .  doesn't work ,  does it ?  a lawyer ,  maybe ,  but not a gun .  doesn't fit .  )  as for jamie foxx ,  well ,  just watching him try to deliver a dramatic and heartfelt dialogue is ludicrous ,  and makes me want to hurl .  3 .  you try to be action-packed ,  but instead are dull and dragging too many times .  and when the action heats up ,  the tripod for the camera must have been lost ,  for the scenes wobble more than those in the blair witch project ,  and i find myself nauseated ,  and once again i want to hurl .  4 .  you try to be a good movie ,  but you failed ,  you failed ,  you failed !  i would rather walk barefoot across the sahara with a pack full of beef jerky and no water ,  no sunscreen ,  and only meryl streep for company .  this hell would be lovelier than a single minute more spent watching everyone in bait overact their way through an idiotically written story with bill gates for a bad guy ,  and let's not even talk about the massive bomb that goes off in a car that jamie foxx's character has just driven off a cliff ,  but somehow manages to escape .  .  . just kill me now ,  or do the right thing and promise me that somehow i'll never have to watch a movie that is this bad ,  ever again . 
1	this movie has great fight scenes .  now its true that the acting is a little rough .  but if i wanted to see a movie based on acting skills i would watch a cheesy movie like american beauty .  but if you want to see a movie with true martial arts in it and with amazing stunts without the use of wires and flying threw the air like so many movies around now which are over killing the matrix .  then watch this .  now it's true the two main stars in the show where in the kid show the power rangers and another cast member of that show has a bit part in this movie .  but hey the fight scenes are enough to make jet li p**s his pants .  and the stunts are worthy enough for jackie chan to sit threw and admire . 
0	the only film i've ever walked out on .  amazing ,  since i paid for myself and my date and i'm really cheap .  but my brain couldn't stand any more of the dreck being piled on ,  particularly since i could have written funnier material while tie up and gagged .   from the beginning to the end this film offends .  worse ,  it ain't funny .  it wasn't funny then ,  and it sure ain't funny now .  but even worse ,  is that this film represents the beginning of the end of really smart ,  sophisticated comedy .  it's juvenile ,  really sophomoric script and ideas began an era  ( which continues to this day )  where cheap laughs ,  and sexual innuendo dominate the culture of comedy in film .   sexual olympics ?  what high school kid hasn't thought of that ?  the beginning of the end . 
1	i remember watching this film on saturday afternoon tv in the 1950s or 60s .  it was well presented but i do remember there was a message of hope broadcast from transmitters secreted in lamposts in one of the last maniacal executions for impending liberation .  i'm not sure that squares with the facts .   still the film is well done .  the german high command reports wryly without emotion  " the russians are advancing down the fredrich strasse "  as if all went according to plan .   it was my impression that this film and a later american made for tv knock-off was based on the british historian trevor-roper's account by a similar title last days of hitler .  i was surprised to see no credit to trevor-roper .   i agree the newest german film on the subject downfall was as well done as the classic .  the american knock-off was a little flat .   few figures have attracted as much attention from the cinema as adolph .  yet i find it interesting that none of the many films and books that have come out ever speak of hitler's double alluded to in passing in john toland's magnificent historical piece .   was gibs ? 
0	if this film had a budget of 20 million i'd just like to know where the money went .  a monkey could make better cgi effects then what was wasted for 3 hours on this dreadful piece of garbage ,  although i must admit the machines and the martians would have looked really ,  really cool on an original play-station 1 game ,  and early pc games from the mid 90s if a game had ever been made .  what puzzles me is where did the money go ?  pendragon films could have made a great film with good old fashioned models and computer controlled cameras a la george lucas circa 1975-83 ,  and actors who actually look like they care about what they are doing  ( or ruining in this case )  for about the same 20 million .  this is quite possibly the worst film ever made !  i would rather sit through a 24 hour repeat screening of ishtar than watch this film again .  i hated it completely !  i regress .  i say this is the worst film ever made because unlike other bad movies like plan 9 or killer tomatoes ,  or santa claus conquers the martians ,  these are films that are so bad you have a special place in your heart for them ,  you love them .  there is no love for this film and no place in my dvd library for it .  i sold it to a guy for a dollar .  i'm betting the money for the film was spent on booze and other vices for the cast and crew .  shame on you pendragon films !  i want my money back ! 
0	if you want to learn the basics of quantum mechanics ,  spend your $9 on a used textbook ,  not this movie .  i'm a little worried that the money i spent is being used to buy kool-aid for shipment to guyana .    i don't think the directors really got any point across ,  but it looks like maybe they were trying to make several :  1 )  science can explain everything we do ,  meaning that our lives are deterministic ;  2 )  science can't be used to explain everything we do ,  meaning that we have free will ;  3 )  science is ,  like ,  really cool ,  brother ;  4 )  we are god ;  5 )  the world exists only in our minds ;  6 )  sarah norman is a tough role to follow and 7 )  here ,  put this tiny paper square in your mouth and you'll see some really groovy stuff . 
0	first off ,  the title character is not even the main character of the movie .  he is the sidekick of the cult leader .  the actor who portrays igor believed that screaming loud ,  laughing hysterically ,  and having a crooked smile while bugging out your eyes would be an excellent way to scare people .  igor also had the annoying habit of yelling  ( because he never actually just spoke )  in a high pitched voice .  he would also say idiotic one-liners .  for example when the cult leader murders one of his followers with a buzz saw ,  igor upon seeing this ,  yells out  " paul !  no paul !  why'd you do it ?  i could have cut her clean !  so clean !  "  in another scene igor tells a victim that she would have to 'get her own tools for surgery because right now ,  it was his time to operate . ' aside from the bad acting ,  the ending did not make sense because while the story builds up what little steam it has towards the climax ,  which is igor getting a crossbow arrow to the head and the rest of his lunatic buddies being killed ,  he shows up again two more times to kill the remaining 'good guys' .  the movie offers no explanation of this ,  only telling the viewer that igor escaped from the mental hospital .  what ?  ?  ?  bottom line is do not waste your time watching this movie .  i wish i could get back the moments i lost watching this . 
0	an allegation of aggravated sexual assault along with some other unpleasant peccadilloes ,  including improper use of a broom ,  are made against half a dozen or so of the most popular high-school jocks in glen ridge ,  new jersey ,  by a  " mildly retarded "  student  ( heather matarazzo )  .  the investigation and building of the case are handed over to the da's office ,  where ally sheedy and eric stoltz are put in charge .   rumors about the case spread through glen ridge ,  an upper-middle-class suburb where the jocks are adored by everyone in the community .   ( one of their fathers is a police lieutenant .  )  nobody believes matarazzo .   " our boys would never take a slut like that down to the basement ,  rape her ,  and subject her to such sexual humiliation .  "  the question is whether sheedy and stoltz will ever be able to shape a sufficiently cogent case that they can bring the jocks to trial .  matarazzo is not an ideal plaintiff .  she's desperate for love and friendship ,  and that makes it easy for faux friends to mislead her into making false statements .  a slimy reporter says ,   " you can trust me ,  "  but it turns out the reporter can't be trusted at all .  another student ,  a very popular girl in school ,  pulls a linda tripp on matarazzo ,  pretending to be her bosom buddy but all the while asking her leading questions about the incident -- and taping the results !  as a consequence ,  watching this story unfold is like being on a roller coaster .  at first it looks like a good case for sheedy and stoltz .  but then ,  oops ,  the community organizes against the law .  then it looks good again .  but then the reporter interferes .  then that obstacle is no sooner overcome ,  than linda tripp pokes her big nose into the investigation and makes public the tapes that seem to indicate matarazzo was lying .   ( well ,  actually ,  she was lying -- but she was lying to her interrogator in order to please her .  )  then that's overcome ,  but matarazzo objects to taking the stand because she doesn't want to be characterized as  " retarded .  "  eric stoltz is fine in the part of the prosecutor .  i say that for the simple reason that he and i lived in pago pago around the same time .   ( i hope he wasn't the kid i had that altercation with at the bar of the seaside club .  if he was ,  i take back my compliment .  )  ally sheedy is a strange actress and hard to characterize .  she did a marvelous self-restrained job in  " fine art "  but i didn't sense any particular effort being put into this role ,  which was rather formulaic anyway .  i mean ,  neither she nor stoltz nor anyone else could give a bravura performance in what's essentially a comic book story .   the producers and director had the good sense to choose heather matarazzo for the role of victim .  the very worst thing they could have done is cast an ethereally lovely ,  neotenous blond .  instead ,  matarazzo ,  without being at all ugly ,  looks rather plain and this ordinary quality is complemented by her grooming and make up .  nor have the writers turned her wistful and gentle .  she has a temper and is sometimes irritating to listen to ,  which is all for the good .   matarazzo's character is the best drawn in the film .  the jocks are stereotypes .  pure evil .  they think themselves above the law ,  barge in on some nice girl's party in east orange ,  trash the place during a party far worse than  " la dolce vita's "  climactic orgy ,  and leave without explanation or apology .  they deserve to get it in the neck -- and they do .   i referred to this as a comic book story and that's pretty much what it is .  it challenges none of our prejudices .  it reaffirms out belief that the world can be divided into good and evil .  and we don't have a moment's doubt about who's who .  what i'm waiting for -- not really ,  that's just rhetorical -- is a movie almost exactly like this one and a dozen others ,  but in which the victim is lying in order to get her name and photo in the papers and garner all those sympathy chips from right-thinking folk like the rest of us .   the film is based on a true story ,  as are so many others we've all seen ,  and even more fictional features .   ( eg .  ,   " the accused "  .  )  some are good ,  some are strictly routine .  okay .  fair enough .  now when do we get to see a film about the tawana brawley case ,  in which the teen-aged girl disappeared on a whim for a few days ,  then had her friends strip her ,  tie her up ,  and smear her with dirt ,  so she could claim she'd been abducted and raped by the police ?  now that would be a challenge in a way this one simply is not . 
0	when converting a book to film ,  it is generally a good idea to keep at least some of the author's intended tone or conveyed concepts ,  rather than ignoring the author altogether .  while it is clear that the director had access to and went on the advice of elinore stewart's children ,  it is key to note that the children believed their mother to be a complete liar in regards to the good ,  enriching ,  strengthening experiences of homesteading her land .  the book details her life on her and her husband's adjoining homesteads in the vast wyoming frontier ;  she chronicles daily adventures with her numerous friends and acquaintances ,  though they lived dozens of miles apart .  the film ,  however ,  takes a standard stance for the time it was made ,  portraying this woman's experience as harsh ,  unforgiving ,  and nearly pointless .  perhaps the director was bringing some of his vietnam war experiences with him to this movie  ( as some film aficionados have said )  ,  but it seems to be a lousy excuse for taking all the joy and beauty of the book and twisting it into a bleak ,  odious landscape devoid of friends or hope .  don't waste your time with this movie ;  read the book instead . 
0	reading my review of the house that screamed ,  many may assume that i'm some 14 year old who thinks scream is considered  " classic "  horror .  this is not the case ,  as i'm 30 years old and have been watching horror films for most of my life .  but admittedly ,  i'm a child of the 80's that grew up on slasher/zombie/ghost/cannibal ,  etc .  .  . types of horror films - so i do typically prefer horror films that are more graphic and faster-paced .  just like someone who can appreciate different music ,  painting ,  or in this case ,  film - but not necessarily like them - i can appreciate why some people may enjoy this sort of film .  .  . i just don't .  .  .   the house that screamed is an exceedingly dull and tedious film about a school for wayward girls .  the heavy-handed mistress of the school rules with an iron hand  ( or whip in some cases .  .  .  )  to keep the girls in line .  she has a young son who creeps around and peeps on the girls while they shower  ( in their nightgowns no less  (  ?  !  ?  )  .  .  .  )  ,  and meanwhile ,  girls are disappearing from the school as they are the victim of a murderer who's lurking about the campus .  .  .   i can see why the house that screamed is often compared to suspiria  ( which is a masterpiece of a film in my opinion .  .  .  )  ,  in terms of the atmosphere of the school itself and the interaction between the girls and their guardians - but this film is so dull and uneventful that i could barely stay awake .  i'm all for  " tension "  and  " suspense "  in horror films - but this film held neither for me .  luckily ,  i wasn't expecting a whole lot going into this one ,  so i can't say i was really disappointed - the house that screamed just reinforced the fact that i personally don't typically enjoy most horror films much older than from the 70's .  this isn't a hard and fast rule ,  but those that i have enjoyed definitely seem to be more of the exception .  probably a  " must-see "  for horror fans who enjoy more understated and suggestive horror films - but as i don't really know too many fans of that sort of material ,  i can't really recommend this one .  .  . 4/10
1	i've read the other reviews and found some to be comparison of movie v real life  ( eg what it takes to get into music school )  ,  britney bashing ,  etc ,  etc .  so let's focus on the movie and the message .   i have rated this movie 7 out of 10 for the age range 8 to 14 years ,  and for a family movie .  for the average adult male .  .  .  .  2 out of 10 .   i like pop/rock music ,  i'm 45 .  i know of britney spears but never realised she actually sang stronger until i read the credits and these reviews .  i didn't recognise her poster on the wall so i was not worried about any 'self promotion' .   i watch movies to be entertained .  i don't care about casting ,  lighting ,  producers ,  directors ,  etc .  what is the movie and does it entertain me .   i watched this movie for the message .  the world's greatest epidemic is low self-esteem  ( which is a whole other story )  so watched with the message in mind ,  as that is an area of interest .  the movie is light ,  bright and breezy ,  great for kids .  i found the texan twang began to fade throughout the movie and of course there are only so many ways to convey the give up/don't give up message ,  so yeh ,  it was a bit predictable .  great message though .  .  . should be more of them .   this movie is a great family movie ,  but for a bloke watching by himself ,  get hannibal . 
1	this film is a great example of fine storytelling .  the acting is superb .  the story is inspiring without being overly manipulative or fake .  there were a couple points where they probably made people a tad more good or bad than they really were ,  but considering it is a hollywood movie ,  they showed amazing restraint .  there wasn't a single explosion shown in the movie ,  even though they had one opportunity to .  the film ,  while having suspenseful parts ,  was not made into an action movie .  the story is thus made to focus on an extraordinary man in unfortunately ordinary times .  well done ! 
0	this might be unbelievable ,  but this movie has grossed $878 , 138 in russia !  it's shown in almost all cinema theaters and still running !  well ,  i have no idea why distributors put their eye on this particular uh  " movie "  ,  which had almost no screening around the world .  that's some kind of enigma !  haha !  maybe it was based on the fact that another movie ,   " pledge this "  with paris hilton ,  which was as well released only dvd almost everywhere ,  had major screenings in russia and grossed more than 1mln$ .  besides ,  both movies had a lot of promotion ,  like there were the banners all over the city ,  tv commercials and etc .  speaking about movie ,  i'd say it's dull and absolutely boring .  it could be better ,  really .  even if it has jessica simpson . 
0	given the history of the director of this movie ,  it is hard to believe that this was such a painfully bad movie to sit through .  i was at the european premiere last night and one of the executive producers was there .  he was yet to see the movie and ,  boy ,  was he in for a surprise .  i have not read the book that this is based upon ,  nor do i know if it highly rated or appreciated ,  but i have read  " captain correlli's mandolin "  and given how poorly that was adapted for screen and how bad this movie was ,  i can only presume that something similar has happened here .  the acting wasn't bad albeit that there were a couple-too-many raised eyebrows from farrell .  honestly ,  i can't believed how little i cared for any character in this movie .  situations play out on the screen in an empty sequence of nothingness .  donald sutherland's part comprises a few scenes where he opens a door ,  says something and closes it again .  i kept looking at my watch when i wasn't cringing at the dialogue on the screen .  i have never walked out on a movie but i was tempted to start during this .  i gave this movie a score of '2' for reasons which seem horrendously shallow to me but these are the best things that i can say about this movie .  the first is that i really enjoyed the all-too-short earthquake scene and the second is that salma hayek got naked and looked beautiful .  i can say little else positive about this movie .  don't ask the dust anything ,  it can't talk ! 
1	john waters has made the most effusively buoyant ,  heartfelt ,  dark ,  personal little film i think i've ever seen  ( well maybe fast food fast women comes in close second )  the directors vision is untainted .  .  . the narrative is whimsical ,  the characters are personal and odd reflections of family and his own inner life  .  .  . the tone never forced or stylistically over-arch .   there is no pretentious shot design ,  ennui ,  or magazine grading .  .  .  . martha plimpton is amazing as the sister .  . eddie furlong is inspired casting .  a grandmother with a talking mary ,  tea-bagging ,  recycled clothing ,  yesterday's garbage becomes today's art -- and the lesson of the film is that the most important thing we can value is family  .  .  .  and a humble life . 
0	ummm ,  please forgive me ,  but weren't more than half the characters missing ?  in the original novel ,  valjean is a man imprisoned for 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread and then attempting several times to escape .  he breaks parole and is pursued relentlessly by the police inspector javert .  along the way there are many characters that weren't in this version .  some worth mentioning would be fantine ,  cosette ,  m & mme .  thenardier ,  eponine ,  marius ,  gavroche ,  and enjolras .  the only character with the same name is javert .  i was confused and frustrated throughout the whole movie ,  trying to see how it was in any way connected to victor hugo's epic novel . 
1	few movies can be viewed almost 60 years later ,  yet remain as engrossing as this one .  technological advances have not dated this classic love story .  special effects used are remarkable for a 1946 movie .  the acting is superb .  david niven ,  kim hunter and especially roger livesey do an outstanding job .  the use of black and white / color adds to the creative nature of the movie .  it hasn't been seen on television for 20 years so few people are even aware of its existence .  it is my favorite movie of all time .  waiting and hoping for the dvd release of this movie for so many years is ,  in itself ,   " a matter of life and death "  . 
0	oh my god !  please ,  for the love of all that is holy ,  do not watch this movie !  it it 82 minutes of my life i will never get back .  sure ,  i could have stopped watching half way through .  but i thought it might get better .  it didn't .  anyone who actually enjoyed this movie is one seriously sick and twisted individual .  no wonder us australians/new zealanders have a terrible reputation when it comes to making movies .  everything about this movie is horrible ,  from the acting to the editing .  i don't even normally write reviews on here ,  but in this case i'll make an exception .  i only wish someone had of warned me before i hired this catastrophe
0	i just saw this movie ,  and i have to say that it was a big waste of time .  the girl who played eva  ( ellen fjaestad )  can't act at all .  she read her lines very un-naturally ,  and she had a very un-natural facial expression through the entire movie .  rosanna munter who played petra on the other hand ,  is a natural .  she played her part with great perfection .   spoilers !  the story was simple - we've seen it many ,  many times before .  she breaks up ,  he finds another ,  she get jealous ,  he breaks up with the other girl and they end up back together in the end .  there were no surprises at all ,  one knew that eva would break up ,  and that adam would  " hook up "  with petra .  the only thing that nobody saw coming was that petra told adam to go after eva at the party .  she became all serious ,  which is a side of petra the viewers hadn't seen earlier in the movie ,  and told him to win eva's heart back ,  which was really cute .   besides rosanna munter ,  there isn't a single actor who gives a memorable performance .   this is a mediocre movie with mediocre actors ,  so i don't recommend it ! 
0	after buying the dvd in a bargain bin due to the impressive amount of features listed on the cover ,  i popped it in the dvd player and everything looked good .  nice animated menus and a whole lot of extra features .  .  . but when i played the movie itself ,  what a let down .  it is the worst thing i have ever seen and i have seen some bad movies in my time .  the comment that praises the movie here at imdb is actually from the people who made the film .  so don't believe it unless you like to waste your cash ! 
0	i guess its possible that i've seen worse movies ,  but this one is a real stinker !  the plot is unremarkable but thats not the worst of it .  the directing is no where close to what you would expect from andy ching .  he's capable of good work but failed to pull this movie together .   angie harmon ,  playing the female lead as a reporter dogging into who's behind the assassination of the president ,  truly butchered the role .  there was no chemistry with gooding ,  her demeanor was flat and wooden ,  and the 5 inch spike heels she wore throughout the movie were absurd .  this outing for harmon places her solidly at the bottom of the  " b "  list .   and what was cuba gooding thinking ?  ?  ?  he has to his credit a number of outstanding performances ,  but this was far beneath what we've come to expect from him .   poor james woods and burt reynolds .  poor poor poor poor poor . 
0	ah ,  lucio fulci ,  rest in peace .  this infamous italian is most  famous for  " zombie ,  "  and the absolutely unwatchable  " the  psychic "  and  " manhattan baby .  "  well ,  add this to the unwatchable  list .   the plot ,  as it were ,  concerns a nekkid woman who wears a gold  mask and a g-string .  she wants the power of a young dubbed  stud who has a set of magic arrows and a bow .  they are magic  because they glow .  arrow boy teams up with a guy in a bad wig ,   and they spend most of the movie rescuing each other from flat  action sequences .  in the end ,  the nekkid chick is defeated ,  but not  before taking the mask off and reminding me why i broke up with  my high school girlfriend .   fulci bathes every shot in an orange glow and fills the screen with  smoke .  nothing like a smoky orange action sequence to make you  crave sunny delight and a cigarette .  the special effects are  laughable .  in one sequence ,  our ambiguously gay duo are  attacked by dozens of arrows that are obviously pin scratches on  the film itself .  the majority of the effects budget must have been  spent on the fulci-licious gore ,  which consists entirely of spurting  wounds .  hey ,  we can all use a good spurting wound once in a  while ,  but when you get into spurting wound overkill ,  it gets boring .   i kept having to play with the brightness setting on my tv anyway  just to see what the heck was happening .   there is lots of talk of fulfilling omens and prophecies ,  so let me  do a little look into the future .  .  . if you find this movie and watch it ,   you will regret it .  the scene on the video box  ( by media )  does not  appear in the film in any context whatsoever .   " conquest "  is a con  job .  what mst3k could have done with this !   this is rated  ( r )  for strong physical violence ,  strong gore ,  female  nudity ,  brief male nudity ,  and mild sexual content .   
0	after having seen the movie the first question arising in my mind was :  is this supposed to be irony or not ?  after reading a few comments about the character doc savage and the comic series ,  i knew this film was not meant to be ironic .  so ,  the story tells us about an us-american super-doc saving a south american republic from evil .  sounds like a typical story .  but this one comes in such an unrealistic way that it becomes ridiculous .  the mandatory end-fight shows the worst presentation of martial arts i have ever seen .  the film might be interesting for low budget movie designers as a bad example . 
0	it is enjoyable and fast-paced .    there is no way on earth that the actor playing mat could be eighteen .  however ,  the main thing is that he does act eighteen very convincingly .  it must be a credit to his audition that he convinced them to cast him .  i quite soon accepted him as being a naive young country boy .   while his was the best performance ,  most of the others were also very engaging .  in particular ,  the interplay between the policemen was natural and well-balanced ,  and worked very well .   it is only about 45 minutes long ,  so the plot is not complex .  more key is the style of the whole thing .  it is very slick and vibrant ,  and the backdrops are atmospheric ,  especially from the fact that all the colours are extremely rich .  the gangland is identifiable to foreign audiences ,  but still manages to be distinctly australian . 
0	i just watched this movie on starz .  let me go through a few things i thought could have been improved ;  the acting ,  writing ,  directing ,  special effects ,  camera crew ,  sound ,  and lighting .  it also seemed as though the writers had no idea anything that had to do with the movie .  apparently back in 2007 ,  when the dollar was stronger you could buy a super advanced stealth bomber that could go completely invisible for $75 million .  now-a-days those things cost about $3 billion and they cant go invisible .  apparently you can fly from the us to the middle east in an hour .  there was a completely random lesbian scene ,  which i didn't mind ,  but it seemed like a lame attempt to get more guys to see it .  the camera would randomly zoom in on actors and skip to random scenes .  oh yeah ,  since its a steven segal movie ,  its predictable as hell .  all in all i rank it right up there with snakes on a plane . 
0	the shame of it !  there i was ,  comfortable in the arm chair with a beer and a bag of popcorn ,  bouyant in the hope of another splendid muppet night of entertainment .  what did i get ?  disappointed !  how can the muppets go from the sublime christmas carol to this ?  the humour was dreadful ,  the songs were worse than country and western  ( and that's saying something )  and the plot was as confused and poor as blind pew .  i think the main problem was that they bit off too much in attempting treasure island .  a short tale ,  such as christmas carol ,  is perfect because you can weave the muppet high jinks around it .  .  .  . here the need to drag the plot along stopped all the fun .  where do the muppets go next ?  how about muppets wizard of oz ? 
1	this is a very moving picture about 3 forty-something best friends in a small england town .  one finds a passionate loves and a new beginning with a younger piano instructor ,  when tragedy strikes and hearts are changed forever .  definitely a film to have a box of tissues with you !  a powerful piece of work .  this is definitely one of my favorite films of all time .   *spoiler !  !  !  spoiler alert !  !  spoiler !  ! *  the main character is taken by her young ,  handsome piano instructor and a passionate romance blossoms .  her two jealous  " friends "  play an immature prank which quickly leads to tragedy .  she loses her love and her friends in one foul swoop .  in the end a unexpected surprise pulls them back together .  ( in my opinion her forgiveness is not warranted ) 
0	this movie sucked plain and simple .  okay so it's basically about a girl that gets raped ,  and to get revenge she gets another guy to rape the rapist .  the rapist is a douche ,  but the girl victim is partly to blame .  i mean they both get in the mood and start kissing and stuff ,  but when the rapist tries to have sex with her ,  she doesn't allow it so the rapist rapes her .  and the thing is the rape scene for the girl is very short and it doesn't really expose or show anything ,  but when it comes to the rapist getting raped ,  it's a pretty long rape scene .  there is basically nothing in the story that is worth watching .   3 . 2/10
1	frustrated middle-aged deputy district attorney george maxwell  ( a fine performance by george e .  carey ,  who also produced this picture )  can't stand his naggy ,  frigid wife edith  ( a perfectly bitchy anne bellamy )  anymore .  worse yet ,  poor george is further saddled with a newborn baby sun and a lascivious lesbian teenage daughter  ( dishy brunette sheri jackson )  .  george has an adulterous fling with lovely ,  enticing and free-spirited swinging hippie babysitter candy wilson  ( delightfully played with sexy aplomb by yummy blonde knockout patricia wymer )  .  complications ensue when george finds himself being blackmailed by the bitter julia freeman  ( a nicely venomous turn by kathy williams )  ,  who wants george to spring her psychotic biker boyfriend laurence mackey  ( a frightening robert tessier ,  who sports a head full of hair here )  from jail .  director tom laughlin  ( yep ,  the same dude who portrayed billy jack !  )  and screenwriter james mclarty cram the splendidly seamy story with a winning and highly entertaining surplus of delicious female nudity ,  sizzling soft-core sex ,  and raw violence .  moreover ,  they accurately peg the whole wild'n'easy uninhibited sensibility of the 60's youth culture and relate the plot in a tight 75 minute running time ,  thus ensuring that this movie doesn't overstay its welcome .  one definite highlight occurs when candy invites her groovy friends over the maxwells house for an impromptu basement bash complete with pot smoking ,  wailing rock music ,  and ,  of course ,  hot naked dancing chicks .  robert o .  ragland's funky score hits the gnarly spot .  stanton fox's stark black and white cinematography adds an extra gritty edge to the deliriously sleazy goings-on .  best of all ,  this flick rates as a marvelous showcase for the utterly charming and fresh-faced pixie patricia wymer ,  who positively lights up the screen with her sweet ,  bubbly personality and captivating beauty .  a total trashy treat . 
1	on paper this looked like a great concept :  average guy on the rebound dates up tight bookish museum curator ,  who is really a hot superhero who saves the world on a regular basis .  however ,  director ivan reitman and writer don payne  ( of the  " simpson's "  )  almost fatally miscalculate in having their hero g-girl  ( played by striking uma thurman )  come off as a total nut job as both superhero and secret identity persona jenny johnson .  the movie even cops to this in a conversation between jenny and matt saunders  ( luke wilson )  following his rescue by g-girl from the statue of liberty .  jenny curiously asks matt what was g-girl like .  matt replies ,   " she's kind of nutty "  i think the intent was to have jenny  ( thurman )  be this lonely young woman ,  who has no one in her life ,  isolated by her great physical powers .  thurman does the best she can ,  but her jenny is a terrifying mood swing in dire need of prozac .  luke wilson is way too breezy in the role reversal of boyfriend and superhero girl friend .    " my super ex-girlfriend "  is also a victim of bad timing ,  coming on the tail end of  " superman returns "  which plays superhero straight up ,  so to speak .  with all its quirks and inconsistent writing i still thought  " my super ex-girlfriend "  was funny and enjoyed the movie .  given that this is an ivan reitman movie ,  this could have been a lot better .  reitman starts with a great premise ,  and really squanders it .  first off ,  we all love the hero .  here neither jenny nor g-girl is really all that likable .  this is surprising for uma thurman ,  who is normally a charismatic and powerful presence .  in the beginning her jenny/ g-girl is just plain weird .  shocking .  because if there is a woman who can play a superhero ,  she is thurmanshe looks great .  only toward the end does her jenny become more sympathetic ,  instead of caricature .  although  " my super ex "  is not a straight superhero story ,  rather a romantic comedy of sorts ,  it does not provide what every superhero mythology requiresa great super villain .  here we have professor bedlam aka barry  ( eddie izzard )  who really is evil lite .  he is no lex luthor .  no plans for global domination .  bedlam rather barry does hold a grudge against g-girl ,  and expectedly it has to do with their shared past .  what is bizarre you don't know who you would rather spend time withbedlam or g-girl ?  luke wilson's matt is just  " some dude "  who happens to hook up with the psycho superhero .  one of the annoying things he does is that he confides in his repugnant loser friend vaughn  ( rainn wilson doing a bad whacked out impersonation )  .  wilson sometimes plays it a little too dense ,  and this dilutes his likable charm .  this does however work ,  in the comic sex scene with jenny .  matt while dating jenny/ g-girl realizes that he is in love with his co-worker hannah  ( perky anna faris )  .  so how does matt break up with g-girl ?  well ,  it's not pretty and for the most part hilarious .   dramatic superhero movies work .  romantic comedies with chemistry work .  what may be inherently difficult are superhero satires disguised as romantic comedies .  everyone loves the hero .  however ,  hero nut job ?  maybe not .  with all uma thurman's talent she is unable to accomplish this convincingly .  and she does not get sufficient support from reitman and payne .  thurman and wilson have enough charm and presence to survive their narrative failings .   " my super ex-girlfriend "  is fun and funny .  though given all involved ,  the movie could have been super . 
0	this is one of those movies that should have been way better than it turned out to be .  i dread to think what the blockbuster-approved edit must have looked like ,  because the director's cut on dvd was a bore of the epic proportions .  naturally ,  you don't expect it to be  " the godfather "  ,  but an acting class or two might have come in handy .   also ,  there were so many cute guys in this movie ,  but they were woefully under-exploited .  i like watching a bevy of hotties writhe around in their bvds as much as the next guy ,  but even i have a right to expect a little more .  it wasn't a total loss ,  though ;  at least we got a peek a drew fuller's  ( covered )  junk and truly upsetting haircut .  and there's huntley ritter looking even cuter than he did in  " bring it on "   ( and acting about as well )  .  there's always a silver lining ,  kids .  you just have to look really hard for it .  and occasionally ,  you have to make use of your pause button . 
0	this film has its good points :  hot chicks people die  the problem .  .  .  the hot chicks barley get nude and you don't get to see many of the people dieing ,  mostly just lots of fast movements and screaming though there were two good kill scenes .   also for those of you watching this for jenna jameson she is just a side chearator with a very small role and minor nude scenes .   what this film needed .  .  script and story would be nice but i will not complain about that .  .  simply put it needs more nudity and better kill scenes cuz lets face it that is why we watch these flicks .  .  .   i wouldn't waste my money on it .  .  . and if you must ,  wait until it's on the old shelves at your local video store
0	if you like the standard sly flicks that involve over the top action ,  unbelievable stunts  ( unbelievable is not intended to be complimentary here )  ,  and retarded dialogue ;  you will love this steaming pile of mountain goat dung .  i had high hopes based on the trailer .  i thought that stalone was going to be forced in his  " has-been "  days to yield to smarter people and make an action film that would place a credible hero in a credible situation where the story ,  setting ,  and  ( believable )  action would prevail .  i crave action that is at least close enough to reality that you can imagine the fear and excitement that would come from such an event .  my limited knowledge of hypothermia and its effects rendered at least one scene laughably ridiculous .  judge dredd is only better because you know going into the theater that you are going to see a comic book made into a movie .  the character ,  setting and everything else are beyond comparison to anything we might encounter ourselves .  cliffhanger on the other hand turns a mountain climbing guide into rambo before you can say  " yo ,  adrian !  "

0	considering its popularity ,  i found this movie a huge disappointment .  maybe i was expecting too much from this film .  after all ,  it is one of the most well known martial arts films of the 1970s ,  but i could never figure out why .  the story is uninteresting .  it is also a very talky movie with sporadic action sequences .  my biggest problem with the movie was that the story does not offer a character that i could root for ,  since the intended hero is an idiot .  director chang has no sense of style ,  and he is unable to hide the glaring imperfections found in the narrative .  i know this is not supposed to be high art ,  but i found the movie boring .  definitely not the best example of this much-beloved genre .  its cult status escapes me .  i recommend you to skip it . 
1	i have no idea why this flick is getting such a bad rap by so many imdb users  ( some are saying it's his 'worst movie ever . ' what ?  ?  haven't any of you seen cradle 2 the grave ?  )  my favorite criticism is that the plot is totally stupid ,  and just an excuse to hang all of the action sequences on .  duh !  what the crap were you expecting from a jet li movie ?  did you honestly believe that someone thought up the story ,  then just loaded it up with action ?  of course not !  black mask is awesome ,  wall-to-wall action throughout nearly it's entire running time .  it's also deliciously gruesome ,  and we get plenty of severed limbs ,  decapitations ,  and creative ways of watching the bad guys  ( and quite a few innocent people ,  too !  )  get slaughtered .  most of li's other martial arts films are nursery-school when compared to black mask ;  there is no holding back on the gratuitous violence ,  bloodshed ,  or action sequences whatsoever !  and that made me a happy camper .  again :  if you go into a jet li movie expecting magnificent dialog and an intriguing plot ,  you are going for the wrong reasons .  black mask is probably my favorite of his movies  ( though ,  beware of the horrendous dubbing )  . 
0	really ,  i can't believe that i spent $5 on this movie .  i am a huge zombie fanatic and thought the movie couldn't be that bad .  it had zombies in it right ?  was i wrong !  to be honest the movie had it's moments .  .  . i thought it was cool when the guy got his head ripped off but that was about it .  overall i think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again .  the movie could have been better if we could see some boob but i had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that .  buyer beware .  .  . unless you are into masochism . 
0	i really wanted to love this show .  i truly ,  honestly did .   for the first time ,  gay viewers get their own version of the  " the bachelor "  .  with the help of his obligatory  " hag "  andra ,  james ,  a good looking ,  well-to-do thirty-something has the chance of love with 15 suitors  ( or  " mates "  as they are referred to in the show )  .  the only problem is half of them are straight and james doesn't know this .  if james picks a gay one ,  they get a trip to new zealand ,  and if he picks a straight one ,  straight guy gets $25 , 000 .  how can this not be fun ?  !  take my hand ,  lets stroll :    the most glaring problem with this show is the bachelor himself .  james is your typical young and successful gay guy with a nice smile and body ,  the one you'd probably give two glances towards at your local bar before grazing for greener pastures .  why they chose to cast james as the leading man is beyond me .  god knows there's so many other hotter and vivacious homosexual men out there dying to be on tv .   aside from his rather average physical appearance ,  james is about as interesting and exciting as a piece of chalk .  even as such ,  he has this arrogant ,  smugly condescending aura about him .  however ,  if james were standing up against a blank ,  white wall he'd meld right into in it .  i honestly can't recall a single interesting or noteworthy thing james said during the course of the show .  he is that boring and forgettable .  in fact ,  one of the mates flat out advised him he wasn't feeling a connection .  i thought that was the best part of the show .  also ,  james speaks with an excruciatingly annoying lilt .  sound feminine or sound masculine ,  but don't ****ing segue tones in the middle of sentences .  .  . so painful to sit through .  i hated him so much all throughout the show i kept thinking ,   " please choose a straight guy and humiliate yourself and your unfortunate looking hag "   then we have the suitors .  a remarkably bland bunch of men who don't seem to care either way what is happening .  equally vapid ,  they seem to be indistinguishable from one guy to the next except ,   " hey that guy has blond highlights or oh that one has curly hair "  again ,  astoundingly inept casting decisions seem to be the aim of this show .  while it may be hackneyed to type cast roles ,  it would've been a lot more entertaining to watch than these amorphous drones .  however ,  in all their banality they still manage to upstage james  ( which isn't all that hard to do anyway )  ,  slightly that is .  you know you have a problem when some of the suitors are actually hotter and more interesting than the leading man .  and the fact that the suitors seem to have more fun around each other than with the leading man ?  very sad .   also ,  i just thought that id point something mentioned on the message boards which i felt was actually true :  the straight men are all hotter than the gay guys .    don't get me wrong ,  im not saying all the gay guys were ugly and boring ,  as a matter of fact i found some of them very cute .  it's just that overall they were just blah compared to the men you'd see on shows like a shot at love with tila tequila or the bachelorette .   i don't know how many times i hit fast forward during this show .  i can accept a lead character as interesting as a cardboard box ,  i can accept the mundane ,  apathetic suitors but please for the love of god entertain me just a little .  no such luck .   if you're expecting drama ,  intrigue ,  sexiness ,  or excitement you will be severely disappointed .  the biggest  " drama "  comes from the fact that one of the suitors still may have a boyfriend in new york  ( how scandalous !  )  .  as titillating as that may be i guarantee you ,  that is the only thing that remotely resembles any conflict on this show .   sure there is the twist ,  but if you have any semblance of gaydar in you ,  you'll easily discern who's who  ( it wasn't hard at all ,  i was only wrong once .  )  this show is stacking so much of its chips on the twist that it fails to deliver anywhere else .   we get to watch as james & co plod along such exciting activities such as learning how to western step dance ,  shopping for gifts ,  visiting a petting zoo ,  and gay karaoke .  yawn .  sure you have the occasional topless dancing but who cares when everyone is boring anyway .  that's one of main problems with the show :  no one seems to be enjoying themselves--they are there just going through the motion trying mightily hard to appear to have a good time .  and you really cant blame them since the events are all wildly unimaginative and lame .   finally ,  the physical aspect is not there .  there's no cuddling ,  no caressing ,  no kissing  (  !  )  ,  no endearment of any sort .  it's just  " ok that was a boring date ,  im gonna go back to my ugly ,  tacky wanna-be sydney operahouse dwelling  ( quick peck on the lips )  cya .  "  this show is so ****ing prudish it's ridiculous .  i can understand them not wanting to play up the perceived indiscretionary nature of homosexual men ,  but come the **** on .  people who watch reality tv shows are gonna want more than standoffish hugs and curt kisses .  this show refuses to compromise .   sorry if this was long winded but i felt these were issues that needed to be addressed .  i do commend bravo for first putting up a show of this nature ,  but the staggeringly incompetent manner in which this show was handled is mind boggling .  to summarize my three points :  boring + boring + boring = go do something else .  you'll have more fun waiting at a doctor's office for an appointment ,  at least they have interesting magazines there . 
1	'holes' was a great movie .  disney made the right choice .  every person who i have talked to about it said they loved it .  everyone casted was fit for the part they had ,  and shia labeouf really has a future with acting .  sigourney weaver was perfect for the warden ,  she was exactly how i imagined her .  everyone who hasn't seen it i recommend it and i guarantee you will 'dig it' . 
0	i came here for a review last night before deciding which tv movie to settle in front of ,  and those i found made this one look unmissable .  how misled i feel !   firstly ,  it needs to be pointed out up front that this is very much a housewife's daytime movie .  the performances are wooden ,  every sentence is an attempt at 'poignant' in the way that housewife's daytime movies and bad soap operas always are ,  and it is based in that predictable and well-trodden premise that men  ( particularly soldiers )  are essentially violent and incompassionate .  the whole movie is about the 'drama' apparent in the moments when the male characters threaten to develop a second dimension .   if that sounds tolerable  ( or even enjoyable )  to you ,  then be warned .  linda hamilton's german accent ,  while quite good ,  is painfully distracting - as is her face ,  for some reason .  the other performances are no doubt an enduring source of embarrassment to their perpetrators ,  with painfully thin and obvious characterizations being the order of the day .  there are few surprises ,  but do watch for the 'monty pythonesque' endless supply of food and drink that miraculously appears from the hungry soldiers' knapsacks !   i wasn't expecting action ,  but i had hoped for beautiful or textural or emotionally charged .  what i got was a particularly bad christmas 'feelgood' story that will have an intelligent audience cringing with the crapulence of it all .   watch it under the folowing circumstances :  1 :  there's nothing else on .  2 :  you are a fan of predictable 'housewife takes on men and wins' tv movies .  3 :  the only way you can appreciate a true story is when hollywood turns it into a feature film .  4 :  you've imbibed enough nog that your emotions are easily stirred by unsophisticated storytelling . 
0	if this series supposed to be an improvement over batman - the animated series ,  i ,  for one ,  think it failed terribly .  the character drawing is lousy .  .  .   ( catwoman ,  for instance ,  looks awful .  .  .  )  but what really annoyed me is that it made batman look like a sort of wimp who just can't take care of himself in a battle ,  without the help of two ,  even three sidekicks .  i mean ,  he's batman ,  for god's sake !  i know the comic books ,  i know that nightwing and batgirl are supposed to be batman's allies ,  besides robin ,  but still .  .  .  making batman say that he needs help from them .  .  .  what ,  he can't handle a few punches ?  in btas ,  he could face a dozen adversaries without any problem .  .  .  he's getting old ?  come on .  .  .   and another thing :  i really don't think that batman would allow a kid like tim drake to go into battle that soon ,  without years of hard training .  one ,  it's irresponsible  ( and batman is everything ,  but irresponsible )  ,  and two ,  it's not what happened in the comics ,  if we are to remain faithful to them .   batman - the animated series made history ,  with its animation ,  its stories and its characters .  .  .  that really was a legend of batman .  the new adventures series turned the legend into just another batman flick . 
1	as i am always looking for something new and unique ,  i watched this film online .  i thought that it would be just another  " b "  rate movie but i was amazed at the acting by the two main characters .  all of the actors in this film were very capable and well directed .  the plot was wonderful and unique as well with an excellent moral to the story .   this movie is definitely not for someone looking for a sex romp ,   " dumb and dumber "  or blood and guts .  this is a wonderfully poignant film showing some grim realities of life coupled with the kindness of the human heart and just enough frivolity to keep it interesting .   i would prefer this movie to many  " a "  rate movies i have seen even a great number with high box office earnings .   i highly recommend this movie . 
1	what a pleasant surprise :  a disney dtv  ( direct to video )  sequel that's actually good .   " the lion king 1 1/2 "  is a comedy affair that involves everyone's favorite meerkat and warthog ,  timon and pumbaa .  it starts out with them watching the original movie and making comments ,  until timon complains that  " we're not here yet "  .  after fighting over the remote ,  timon and pumbaa decide to tell the audience  " their story "  .  they start the new movie ,  and the laughs begin .   to be honest ,  i was losing hope in disney .  most of their direct-to-video fare has been aggressively awful ,  with the story lines desperate to cash in on the original .   " 1 1/2 "  decides to try something different :  it tells the original story from a new point of view .  okay ,  it adds some stuff ,  like where timon came from and how he and pumbaa met ,  but it's an interesting concept .  nathan lane and ernie sabella perfectly recapture the bond and friendship that made us love them in the first movie .  there's also some neat movie parodies  ( including one scene that simultaneously spoofs 'the good ,  the bad ,  and the ugly' and 'cool hand luke )  ,  and the script is filled with funny memorable lines .   added to the cast are julie kavner  (  " the simpsons "  )  as timon's worry-wart mom ,  and jerry stiller as timon's slightly crazy uncle max .  matthew broderick shows up as simba ,  and his  " teen "  scene reminded me of ferris bueller .  everyone does well ,  especially robert guillame  ( is that how you spell it ?  )  as rafiki ,  who exudes more and more yoda-speak in this movie  ( timon comments on this several times )  .   'the lion king 1 1/2' is a perfect alternate choice for those of you getting tired of the shrekification of animation .  10/10
0	the prerequisite for making such a film is a complete ignorance of nietzche's work and personality ,  psychoanalytical techniques and vienna's history .  take a well-know genius you have not read ,  describe him as demented ,  include crazy physicians to cure him ,  a couple of somewhat good looking women ,  have his role played by an actor with an enormous mustache ,  have every character speak with the strongest accent ,  show ridiculous dreams ,  include another prestigious figure who has nothing to do with the first one  ( freud )  ,  mention a few words used in the genius' works ,  overdo everything you can ,  particularly music ,  and you are done .  audience ,  please stay away . 
1	most people who chase after movies featuring audrey tautou seem to not understand that amelie was a character - it is not really audrey tautou's real life personality ,  hence ,  every movie she partakes in is not going to be amelie part 2 ,  part 3 ,  etc .   now with that said ,  i too picked up this movie simply because audrey was in it .  yes ,  it's true ,  there is a big gap after the first scene where she isn't seen at all for maybe 45 min ,  but i didn't even miss her because i was having so much fun with the other characters .  the guy who lies about everything is too funny ,  the guy who justifies people who run out of his cafe and skip out on the bill by finding coupons and such which balance out the loss ,  actually .  .  .  .  getting into all the characters here could take quite a while ,  but this is one of the best movies i've seen in a while .   audrey tautou's character irene is not the overdone sugary girl that amelie was .  in fact ,  as irene ,  her rudeness to a bum asking for change caught me off guard at first .  in this film ,  irene is a girl with good intentions ,  but over the course of a  ( very awful )  day ,  her disposition becomes more and more sour and pessimistic .   what makes this film completely great is you have all these really interesting stories and plots building .  .  .  very entertaining to watch ,  great scenery and shots ,  very colorful and never too slow ,  and all of the characters can actually act .  the best part of the movie comes with about 20 minutes left .  .  .  .  this is when all of the plots start to mesh together and the ride really picks up and everything ties together and makes sense ,  and the whole butterfly effect blossoms .  i swear ,  it was the best 20 minutes of film i've seen in quite a while ,  and the ending .  .  .  .  it made me think  " damn i really lucked out finding this movie "  .  the ending to this movie is top notch .  whoever wrote the script for this is brilliant ,  because not only are there all these other subplots going on ,  but to somehow make them all tie in together  ( and in a sensible manner ,  which is the case here )  but also to make each character feel human and come alive ,  not just some stale persona used as a crutch to build up this whole butterfly effect .  .  .  very impressive .   i highly suggest this movie as it's a great film to watch anytime ,  in any mood ,  with any company or alone . 
0	 " true "  story of a late monster that appears when an american industrial plant begins polluting the waters .  amusing ,  though not really good ,  monster film has lots of people trying to get the monster and find out whats going on but not in a completely involving way .  give it points for giving us a giant monster that they clearly built to scale for some scenes but take some away in that it looks like a non threatening puppy .  an amusing exploitation film thats enjoyably silly in the right frame of mind .   ( my one complaint is that the print used on the elvira release is so poor that it looks like a well worn video tape copy that was past its prime 20 years ago .  ) 
1	i don't know why people except a lot from low budget indie films but i enjoyed this one as i'm a fan of urban horror .  there's not too many urban horror movies out there so when i saw this one on the shelf ,  just the title alone peaked my curiosity .  so i decided to check it out and i was surprised .  .  . it's not too often you run into a low budget indie horror film with great acting and a good story .  is it low budget ?  yes .  can you tell that it's low budget ?  yes .  .  . but once you start watching the movie you become so wrapped up in the story that it doesn't matter .  i like hip hop music too and the soundtrack is nice !  i don't know what's up with all these bad reviews for this film .  all i hear is  " worst movie ever "  .  have these idiots seen every movie out there ?  there's thousands of movies out there ,  how can you categorize one as the  " worst "  ever ?  a video not  " movie "  like  " zombiez "  may be the worst film i ever seen but i can't say that it's the worst movie ever since i haven't seen every movie out there .  bottom line these people who gave this movie bad reviews are probably from the suburbs .  listen ,  if you don't like minority based ,  urban films ,  the ghetto films ,  hip hop , etc then why watch these types of movies ?  ?  ?  !  !  !  knowing that you don't like this type of stuff ?  sure ,  this is a horror film but it's not just a horror film but it's an urban horror film with a multi-cultural based cast .  i don't like tv shows like dawson's creek or the o . c .  ,  they suck to me .  films like  " garden state "  ,   " wedding crashers "  and  " i heart huckabees "  suck to me .  i'm a guy from new jersey and these shows and movies suck to me .  why ?  because i can't relate to them .  they don't peak my interest .  just common sense .  believe me ,  i will never watch garden state 2 :  garden salad ,  wedding crashers 2 :  here's a sequel to torture you again since the first sucked so bad and i heart huckaboring .  now back to this movie ,  in regards to saint405's comment above ,  i don't know if this guy was smoking crack or got knocked  " stupid "  by his drunken dad before he watched the movie but to me ,  everyone did a great job .  the actor who played ricky  ( i forgot his name )  did a very good job .  i'm an aspiring actor myself taking theater at my school and i had to do a play where i had to cry and it's not easy to be emotional in a scene so i give props to actors who have to do an emotional scene and can pull it off .  anywho ,  i liked this movie and never heard of these actors and directors before but you bet i'll be looking out for their stuff for now on and if they are reading this ,  bring on the sequel !  !  !  i'm out .  jerzee representin' !
