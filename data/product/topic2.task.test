books	this is definitely not one of my favorite books about stocks . the title of the book is a little deceiving , the author talks a lot about option instead of stocks and half the book is about stock splits . chapters 1-4 are about general info , such as you must buy and sell to make money , do n't hold for a long time . you must research the stock before purchase , eps must increase every year . i did n't find anything in those chapters that i did n't already know . chapters 5-10 is all about stock splits and when to purchase the stock as well as when to sell . once again , the author talks about the obvious ; buy when you hear that stock is splitting and sell after the split before the after split dip . chapter 11 gets into more advanced trading techniques , the bull put spread . this is not something that i use or will use in my trading . chapter 12 is the concluding chapter
books	more than human is one of those books that has garnered high praise from the science fiction community because of its strong prose and original ideas . the writing is often compared to that of faulkner but i would n't make that connection having read a few of faulkner 's works . sturgeon uses many of faulkner 's narrative trademarks ( i.e . streaming conscious , first person perspective of low iq individuals , disorienting changes in first person narrative ) but i did n't feel the net effect really compared to say something like as i lay dying . i love science fiction books and the readers in general love the genre which is why they want it to be taken seriously . this results in undue adulation and comparisons to mainstream books . more than human is slow , dated and not what i would describe as genre transcending nor would i recommend it to others . so the idea might of been original in the 50 's but topics like telekenesis , esp , computer-brain babies , and self produced morality and ethos have all been tackled more successfully in other science fiction classics before ( asimov ) and since . this book rarely set off that wow ! button in my head or kept me turning pages . this book simply did not have enough meat in it to make it anything more than mediocre at best . in 1953 there were 5 hugo award nominees for best science fiction book ( determined in a retro hugo award ballot in 2004 ) the retro hugo awards are fascinating because the voting ( in this example ) takes place 50 years later so the impact of the book on society ca n't really be ignored . besides more than human , the far superior the caves of steel , childhood 's end , and farenheit 451 were among the other entries in a banner year for classic sci-fi . needless to say , more than human did not win ( farenheit 451 did and rightfully so ) bottom line : i wanted to like this book and it does n't surprise me that others give it such high praise . these are probably people that do n't read other genres enjoy congratulatory wankfests
books	i think that the beginning of the book was the worst part . he started by telling us that he was leaving and was n't going to tell anyone . he did n't even say goodbye to a lady friend . so he tells us that he 's leaving and then he goes back into the past . back when he was a little kid . he tells about different experiances . how he had to stay in bed for almoxt five years . he tells about all the troubles that his family went through . the end was the best part . i usually hate the endings but this one was good . this bool is meant for older people who like english books . or is it ireland . i think it was set in irelan
books	this book is a standard one for graduate-level algebra courses . i practically wore mine out over a year-long course , and came to know it intimately . dummit and foote is a book that teaches via wordy explanations and lots of examples . of course , examples are very important . however , the explanations are often muddled and not clear ( e.g . see tensor products ) . they frequently relegate important theorems or definitions to the exercises , and the organization is poor . consequently , it can be very hard to find things later when you might need them . also , the bindings on this book frequently fail . my book fell apart very quickly , and i know other students who had the same problem . i recommend rotman 's advanced modern algebra instead of dummit and foote .
books	this poorly executed story drags on for too long while the town waits for the return of sister north . in the end , we really do n't care if she ever returns . the ending is cliched and predictable . a waste of time
books	i was shocked to open this book and find the author 's words targeting the very soul of my writing . it is a book about craft , not a pop culture `` i wan na write a book '' manual.gerard shows a great understanding of the motivation behind the need and desire to write well . he speaks to those who are willing to put effort and excellence where their pen meets the page.i heartily recommend this book
books	the title of this book is rather deceptive in that you certainly do n't need to be adventurous or daring to find this book helpful . i do sedate landscapes and found his book an excellent guide . basically , if you do the least bit of original design in your work - altering an element or two , changing colors around - or if you do whole original works ( but have n't actually gone to art school ) this book is extremely useful . it covers the basics of design and color with a focus on the embroiderer or fiber artist . you can do all the suggested activities in the book in order as a complete design course , or pick and choose sections as needed . if you wonder why some of your works look great and others look , well , not as great , this book is for you
books	well , the fact that i 'm writing a review about this book , while it 's sitting open on my desk next to my computer , open and not being read , might be some evidence of how i 'm enjoying this book . this book just goes on and on in complex an unclear language about a subject which should n't be so difficult . this book is not clear or easy to understand at all . every sentence is awkward and followed by a footnote , and the masses of footnotes together take up half of each page ( ! ) , making this work look like a research project for a phd publication . i have the casebook in this series , and sometimes it seems reading the cases alone will bring more clarity . and it turns to be true ! this book might be good if you 're advanted-contracts and want to know every little detail , or as an advanced reference later on , to look something up like in an encyclopedia . some concepts , which should be pretty clear just get too in-depth coverage in this book . it 's too complex for a first-year student . sometimes it starts describing the different views out there , and then there 's a jumble in your head as to what the law really is . i wish the author used his own knowledge and fluid language more than footnoted ideas from other authors .

books	a book full of heartwarming stories from country stars , singers , writers , and listeners , or so the back of the book said . as i read some sentimental stories , and some down right boring stories i questioned how more than half of these stories got into the `country1 edition of the chicken soup series . i loved about three stories , liked about ten , and was puzzled by all the other entries

books	this is not a good study guide for an employment law class . too basic and general . this may be good for a business owner wanting basic info about hiring/firing etc , but they would definitely still need to seek the advice of an attorney
books	i am a prekindergarten teacher . this book is a favorite of all of my students both boys and girls . the story has an important moral that all children can learn from . the moral is to be yourself and that you do not need to copy others . stephanie not only does her own thing but stands up for herself . this story gives children the courage to stand up for themselves and to be an individual
books	this books starts with such promise but i find it hard to believe that the people who wrote the glowing reviews were actually able to slog through it ! minutiae-fest
books	i purchased this book as a read aloud for my two oldest children . i liked the story but the chapters were way too long . my children kept asking , `` how many more pages ? ''
books	does not show you techniques rather it just shows pictures ! after buying this book- i was very disappointed since i thought it will show me makeup tips and tricks , rather it just shows displays of women 's faces . you will waste your money on purchasing this book
books	this is hawking 's attempt to write about complicated physics for those of us who did not do well in math and therefore did not take the advanced sciences requiring ability in math . while still not an easy read , it it much easier than the brief history of time that he wrote for laypeople before this . a person who wants to know what the current scientific thinking is about the nature of the universe will find it worth spending the time it takes to read and digest this book , as they will be reading about it from one of the leading scientists in this field . older teens who have some interest in sciences may also find this to be a helpful introduction to the concepts they think they want to study in depth
books	in self-hypnosis for women c. alexander and annellen simpkins have created an instrument , a book and cd combination tailored to both the novice and the familiar practitioner of hypnosis . the simpkins have masterfully crafted this guide to self-guidance weaving explanation and experience throughout the written and spoken words . provided are tools useful in addressing a wide array of events familiar to most on the journey of being human . while true to its title , self-hypnosis for women , offering examples of utilization directly fashioned to `` experiences '' idiosyncratic to women : menstruation , pregnancy , labor and delivery , and menopause , the title of this work belies its more universal `` applicability '' to components of life common to both women and men : self image ; pain management ; overcoming fear and anxiety , and finding personal balance . the book is prefaced with instructions on gaining the most benefit for individual readers . those who may wish to skip over the more basic instructions are advised to begin their journey in later chapters . those who are new to the practice of hypnosis , or enjoy viewing the history and techniques from others ' perspectives are offered just that in the earlier chapters . the story of hypnosis , and the modern history and research of hypnosis take the readers back to the early stages of identified systematic trancework , from mesmer , charcot and freud , to the contributions of hilgard , hull , and milton h. erickson ; they then procede to accompany the participant on the journey through current and future directions , including their own paths , on which they are about to embark . the simpkins define suggestion as `` a process by which a stimulus is accepted and then transformed through unconscious processing into an action , experience , attitude or concept . ( p.45 ) '' this presentation of suggestion sets the stage for an environment conducive to the development of a personal ability to self-guide . together , the book and cd promote the utilization of both conscious and unconscious processes as learning tools , assisting in the transformation from less popular emotions such as fear or sadness to components of life which offers guidance and assistance . specific hypnotic techniques , are explained , and accompanied by exercises which give the audience an immediate opportunity to begin experiencing and tailoring that procedure . the framework for these exercises is the suggestion of an `` experiment '' with that particular technique , creating an environment for the learner to safely attempt each new activity with no possibility of failure . the only opportunity not offered is that of incompetence . there is only a place to try , adjust , and retry each experiment until the reader fashions their own skill set based on personal significance and comfort . more than a `` bonus '' the accompanying cd is a work of art on its own . again , mixing explanation with experiential learning , this auditory tool incorporates fractalization as a teaching method , to assist the listener in entering and returning from graduated levels of trance exploration . a vast canvas is provided , upon which the hypnotic partner can create motor , auditory and visual experiences with encouragement and assistance , rather than direction or interference , a respectful approach not always found in `` self-hypnosis '' recordings . sharon mclaughlin ma , managing editor , milton h. erickson newsletter

books	college stoner cult following aside , hunter s. thompson 's journalistic prowess was a vital national resource up until he left us last february . thompson was one of those brave few who dared to cut through popular media perceptions and glittery rhetoric and travel right to the ugly center of his subject material , counjouring hilarious allegories where the average journalist would already have soiled himself in disillusionment . on the campaign trail should be required reading for all those who hold a less skeptical view of american politics than say , the average wwe heavyweight title match , for a truly sane person should be no more shocked to hear of a politician lying or cheating to increase his presidential hopes than when the undertaker strikes his opponent with a steel chair when the referee turns his back . hunter has long since traveled through this looking glass -- although he can at times be found expressing nostalagia for the wide-eyed optimism of the 60s -- but the result is not nearly as depressing as it is hilarious . the image of thompson infiltrating the nixon youth at the rnc and yelling obscenities and death threats at rival journalist john chancellor 's press box while surrounded by hundreds of kids chanting `` four more years ! '' was one of the funniest any book has offered me in a while . how does the cliche go -- `` the more things change , the more they stay the same '' ? after the thorough spanking of george mcgovern at the hands of richard nixon , hst credits the most staggering blow to mcgovern 's presidential hopes to a media crisis involving his vice-presidential nominee , thomas eagleton . just days after eagleton was named as mcgovern 's running mate , two democratic campaign managers received phone calls revealing that eagleton had gone through intensive psychiatric treatment on three separate occasions . as the story spread like wildfire throughout the press , mcgovern 's presidential hopes were dealt a blow from which they would never recover . since then , we 've seen willie horton and the swift boat veterans come out to haunt their respective candidates , and one is inclined to wonder who the democratic `` mascot '' will be for the 2008 race . perhaps a mentally disabled child whose tricycle was crushed by the car of hillary clinton ? a dominican prostitute who gave joe biden the clap ? but i digress . i give on the campaign trail 4 out of 5 stars because the book , like presidential campaigns themselves , can at times seem uneventful . thompson addresses this from time to time , wondering aloud what it was that made him want to cover politics in the first place before remembering that the rush one feels from being a part of a winning political team is nearly identical to that of a junkie getting that long-needed fix . other parts of the book will only make sense to the more hardcore followers of politics . for instance , hst 's extensive interview with campaign manager rick stearns , where stearns explains the intricacies of acquiring state delegates , reads like hieroglyphics to me .
books	if you are young , under 30 , this is a good guide to help you figure out your path through the minefields of trying to understand the other sex . if you are older , this is a good refresher course on things you may have already learned ( or things that you missed ) in the school of everyday life . for both younger and older readers this is a very good tool to help you understand yourself and others .

books	this cookbook is the best in my collection - and i have a lot ! ! the instructions are clear and the pictures are great
books	this book is out of rint for one reason , it is terrible . i am no lover of big companies but the author is so biased in this book it is hard to believe anything she says . she blames pg for the destruction of the environment , mistreating employees , the role of women in society and racism . pg has done many things wrong , most big companies have , but it is not the cause of the fall of western society
books	this book reads like a horror novel . by allowing her dogs ( as well as another one in her care ) to roam freely throughout an urban area crisscrossed by busy roads , the author demonstrates her utter disregard for the animals ' welfare . not to mention the antisocial attitude she displays with her total inconsideration for her neighbors , and for the countless strangers kind enough to phone when her lost dogs seek refuge on their doorsteps . oh , and let 's not forget the dozens of shelter dogs killed because their potential adoptive homes were filled by the plethora of puppies spawned by the author 's choice not to spay and neuter her animals . this book moves at a peppy pace , and might have been interesting ( albeit morally reprehensible ) if the author 's `` observations '' actually provided any insight . but those eighteen-wheelers on the alewife parkway veered closer to poor misha than the author 's whimsical interpretations stray within range of scientific evidence . case in point : she is so clueless about the reality of canine behavior that she inadvertently allows one of her dogs to kill another one 's litter of puppies . oops ! any genuine dog lover ( or any human with an ounce of compassion and common sense ) will despise this book . a previous reviewer hit the nail on the head : if `` feelings '' are your road map to life , you might enjoy this book . if you regularly take your brain out for walk , forget it . calling this a meaningful book about dogs is like calling `` jonathan livingston seagull '' the definitive text on marine fowl
books	i think the most striking part of this book is that you feel comforted by the fact that the problems you 're facing in your own relationships are commonplace . they 're not dysfunctional . every family has its share of issues and you do n't need to feel overly guilty for yours . the book 's underlying theme is that families that honesty , consideration , character , belief and perhaps above everything else - resilience , can get you through the worst debacles and that at the end of the day it 's probably ( though not always ) worth the effort . stories include : resentment about controlling parents who appear to display conditional loving and also about appreciating how much of their lives parents sacrifice to bring the kids up ; the search for redemption after abandoning a kid or cheating on a wife , the courage required to break relationships that are dead and the perseverance required to bring one back from the dead ( and the effect on kids ) , dealing with the families of your in-laws and family objection to marriage , how to deal with kids who are falling into bad habits when you feel powerless to influence their decisions because they no longer respect you or listen to you , dealing with the death of a child , how we feel obligated to spend time with our families rather than actually wanting to spend time with them and what we are losing , etc . although it may seem that most people can not relate to these situations ... actually i felt an amazing amount of empathy for the families and came away with a renewed conviction that i can get the perfect family life ( with all it 's frustrations and headaches ) and balance it with everything . if you have any relationship , friendship that you have a certain amount of frustration , resignation about then i strongly recommend this book . it is one of those books that if it hits you at the right time - it could change your relationships and your life
books	if you are looking for ideas and techniques this is a wonderful book . very well done
books	is n't it frustrating when a book spends a lot of time building up the problem-to which you say , `` yeah ! yeah ! that 's me ! '' and then gives you no answer , or a weak one to which you say , `` no duh ! '' i 'm afraid this book is one of them . the title is misleading because you assume he will help you find the life you 've only dreamed of , or at least point you in the right direction to get started ! but i was left depressed after reading it because it basically says that god gives us desires that we ca n't have on earth so that we will long for him and heaven . i do n't believe that 's the abundant life jesus promised . so i went to the bible . ( i should have gone there first ! ) i looked up every time it talks about desires and got my answer . `` delight yourself in the lord and he will give you the desires of your heart ! '' ps . 37:4 so i set out to seek him . i started reading `` knowing god '' by j.i . packer and began to get answers to all my questions about desire ! i hope you 'll find them too-in him

books	i 've been a fan of carol dweck 's scholarly work for years . her work on self-esteem , self-concept , and the incremental vs. entity theories of intelligence provides some of the most powerfully useful tools i 've encountered for educators and parents in their work with children , as well as in their own self-awareness and lives . i 'm delighted to see this information written here in such a user-friendly conversational tone , rich with stories that illustrate the nuances and complexities of dweck 's research and ideas . i 'm recommending this book to all of my graduate students ( teachers and principals working with gifted learners ) , as well as to parents of high-ability children . dona matthews , ph.d. , director of the hunter college center for gifted studies and education , city university of new york
books	the professionals in the law field in this book are n't the type of lawyer or law professional most people want to become . i understand not everyone becomes a six-figure-paid lawyer right out of law school , but this book is ridiculous . it shadows a guy who wants to only be a law clerk ? give me a break
books	`` salvador '' completely discredits joan didion and all of her books . the two weeks she is believed to have `` lived '' in el salvador was actually a mere four hours . any truths in this book , and there are but a handful , have been obtained by outside sources , not by her own `` research . '' i lived in el salvador when she came in to gather info for her story . it is an outrage that she so flippantly used the sufferings of the salvadorans to effect personal gain . if you want to read fiction , go ahead . she 's a good storyteller . as a service to yourself , however , keep in mind that the author has almost zero first hand knowledge of what she writes . the only reason i have the book at all is that my father gave it to me . what a shame that he wasted his money on this piece of trash
books	mr. dennett 's book demonstrates the ignorance , irrationality , and dishonesty of humanists . discussing the meaning of word materialsim , professor dennett says : `` in its scientific or philosophical sense , it refers to a theory that aspires to explain all the phenomena without recourse to anything immaterial -- like a cartesian soul , or `` ectoplasm '' -- or god . the standard negation of materialistic in the scientific sense is dualistic , which maintains that there are two entirely different kinds of substance , matter and ... whatever minds are supposedly made of . '' ( p. 302 ) philosophers stopped believing in dualism a thousand years ago with the development of metaphysics . a modern view is that man is an indefinability that becomes conscious of its own existence . the philosophy that god does not exist is not materialism , it is naturalism . materialism is the view that all that exists is matter . materialists frequently say that free will is an illusion and that the experience of the existence of oneself is some kind of epiphenomena . ( in a quote below , you will see that dennett puts free will in a list of things people belief in . ) it is not clear from the book whether dennett is a materialist , but he is certainly a naturalist . concerning the proof of god 's existence , he trots out david hume 's `` who made god ? '' which is based on a misunderstanding of the principle of causality . i refer the reader to my personal website for my version of the proof . let 's look at two quotes , the first is at the end of the chapter `` belief in belief '' and the other at the beginning of the chapter `` morality and religion '' : `` that is , is n't it true that , whether or not god exists , religious belief is at least as important as the belief in democracy , in the rule of law , in free will ? the very widespread ( but far from universal ) opinion is that religion is the bulwark of morality and meaning . '' ( p. 245 ) `` without the divine carrot and stick , goes this reasoning , people would loll about aimlessly or indulge their basest desires , beak their promises , cheat on their spouses , neglect their duties , and so on . there are two well-known problems with this reasoning : ( 1 ) it does n't seem to be true , which is good news , since ( 2 ) is is such a demeaning view of human nature . '' ( p. 279 ) in the first chapter , he mentions `` bulwark of morality '' and `` meaning . '' but in the second chapter , he leaves out `` meaning . '' if our purpose in life is not to get to heaven , what is our purpose is life ? whether religion supports morality can be determined by observing whether there is a correlation of moral conduct with religious belief . mr. dennett makes such a correlation to the detriment of religion by citing the high divorce rate of fundamentalist christians . there are worse things than divorcing your spouse . disingenuousness can be worse and can take the form of leaving unsaid what should have been said . mr. dennett should have explained why he did not discuss the idea that religion gives meaning to life . the only miracle mentioned in mr. dennett 's book is the shroud of turin , which has on it a mysterious image of a crucified man . since no one claims to know how the image got there , it can be called a miracle . however , mr. dennett does not tell us anything about it . the reader is left to find out about the famous relic by looking it up on the internet .
books	to cover all the problems with continuity , logic , theology , geography and plain common sense in _left behind_ would take a whole book . one hardly knows where to start . perhaps it is too early to assess the damage that will be done to christian religion by this trashy novel . as such , it is n't even a decent trashy novel ; instead of steamy sex scenes , we get sanctimonious sermonizing . worse than that , what the authors have done is to turn the powerful imagery of the bible into a cheap comic book , ignoring its spiritual messages in favor of promoting a self-centered preoccupation with getting a ticket to heaven before it 's too late . the comic book aspect can not be overemphasized . even if you suspend disbelief enough to accept the rapture scenario ( an idea with virtually no scriptural support ) , little in the characters ' actions , thought processes or dialog rings true . one gets the impression that the book was hastily thrown together by a junior high school student . god ends up looking like the ultimate villain , demanding that you hurry up and get yourself and your friends on his side or else . whatever happened to the inspiring christian writers of yesteryear ? who is the present-day equivalent of c. s. lewis , or catherine marshall , and why are n't they getting more attention ? these were writers who actually made you think . lahaye and jenkins seem to believe that thinking is the last thing god wants us to be doing ; they hardly miss a chance to put down anyone with any hint of intelligence or independent thought . they show no interest in answering the sort of hard questions that surviving non-believers in such a world might ask . one wonders if they have ever met a non-believer at all , or witnessed the aftermath of a disaster for that matter . these days , it seems as if all the media attention is on the likes of ann coulter or pat robertson , whose mission seems to be to turn christianity into a twisted , bigoted caricature of what it once was . perhaps all the great religious thinkers really have been raptured . if _left behind_ is an example of the sort of writing that we can expect from christian writers , then it is the church itself that is in danger of being left behind
books	i teared when i read parts of the book , but it is such an awesome book ! i did n't want to put that book down until i was completely finished reading it . i definetely recommend it to anyone with children . i loved it , and i plan on keeping up with my letter box to my son
books	the author makes a couple of valuable points . first , any long-term investment strategy has to take into account the existence of recurrent `` secular '' ( i.e. , indefinitely long ) bear markets . most leading investment advisors recommend a `` buy and hold '' strategy , but this only works during predominately bull market periods . most studies of successful investment strategies are biased towards the recent 1982-1999 bull market , which is anomalous in historical terms . the author uses a plethora of graphs and charts to prove that `` buy and hold '' does n't always provide the best returns . obviously , then , it 's better to pull out during the bear markets , but that 's easier said than done . the author provides a very complete analysis of the characteristics of bear markets , including p/e ratio , interest and inflation rates , and gdp . the problem is that those characteristics do n't always correlate with market performance . for example , this book was written in 2004 and the author predicted a bear market . well , if you heeded his advice , you would have missed the bull market of 2004 , 2005 and early 2006 , especially in small-mid caps and foreign stocks . even with high p/e ratios , a bull market can continue for several years : witness the late 90s . it 's virtually impossible to time the market even if you monitor the major stock indexes on a daily basis . there is so much volatility on a daily , weekly , monthly , and yearly basis that 's it 's impossible to know when the market has switched directions . by the time that it is apparent , it 's too late to profit . even in the midst of great bull markets , there might be week , month , or even year-long downturns . the author says nothing about individual stock picking , beyond a general value approach . the book is all about big picture , long term trends . another problem is that the author 's predictions are based on his analysis of market trends going back to 1900 . but the market ( and economy ) is a different beast now that it was in the 40s , 50s , 60s , and 70s . as they say , past performance does not predict future returns . the investment advice provided here is not useful . he suggests a `` portfolio of hedge funds , '' ignoring the fact that most hedge funds require a minimum deposit of 500k . he also recommends a `` bond ladder , '' an approach which can be easily replicated with a good bond mutual fund , and frequent rebalancing of your portfolio asset allocations . i do n't need to spend $ 25 and five hours reading to learn that ! one thing i did learn from this book is the impact of volatility , which is often ignored in investment strategy recommendations . volatility cuts into returns in ways that most studies do not account for . most studies just average the returns across years , but that does n't reflect real returns . let 's say you invest $ 100k into a stock that returns 35 % the first year and -15 % the second . your average return should be 10 % a year , right ? wrong . at the end of the first year you have 135k . minus 15 % the second year leaves you with 115k total , equal to 7 % a year compounded . if you had received 10 % a year compounded , your final total would be over 121k . that 's 6k difference in just 2 years , and the volatility costs add up . the book is very poorly written , plodding , sooooo boring , with tons of repetition . just as an example , the graph showing the `` y curve '' relationship between p/e ratio and inflation is repeated no less than 3 times .
books	what a great upbeat book that still covers the struggles of a child of a divorced family , living in poverty , and being of a mixed race . great great read with a great ending that was n't to unbelievable . it left you with a good feeling even though the struggles of the children were very real . great life lessons as well as cultural lessons in this book
books	i am a big catherine coulter fan , but this book is awful . you can skip all the soap scenes , a waste of space . much of the dialouge made no sense and the characters were very flat . do n't waste the $ 6 , borrow from the library if you want to read
books	i was trying my hardest to be creept out , but like someone said , it read like a pre-teen novel .
books	i ordered this for a friend , thinking it was the same bruce fisher book i bought when i divorced . it is only the workbook and really needs a workshop ( or maybe just a book ) to go with it . it was a total waste of money and not what i expected when i ordered . make sure you are ordering the book , not the workbook , when you order
books	what to say about belarus ? well , we spent the day the white russkis commemmorate the end of wwii there , so i 've seen it in all of its `` grandeur '' . not much to recommend it , go and see belarus if you missed out on the post wwii east european dictatorships , because belarus is the last of its kind . a genuine personality cult around the president runs politics , and you can get a feel for what it was like in 1970 's e. europe . guess what- you will not like it . take some pics of minsk move on to moscow . and if you can find a decent hotel in minsk , you 've done better than my wife and i did .
books	this book covers in depth the lbo of rjr nabisco in the late 1980s . recommended to me by an investment banker friend that knew i wanted to go into m work , i decided to read it . i thought the book was excellent , but maybe unnecessarily long . the authors were meticulous in explaining everything about the deal and those involved - from the history to every single meeting and telephone conversation . the two authors never mentioned whether they were present during every conversation or not , but did an incredible job at recreating all that happened nonetheless . for someone interested in pursuing a top wall street job , this book is a must . for everyone else that just likes good non-fiction , this book does a superb job at representing the greed of an era
books	cruel , horrible story with a typical barr convoluted plot . the abuse of children , evil ranger poising as a dead ranger , freaky religious sect , dead animals on the bed , and lost children were all too disturbing and disgusting to me . i 've read many barr books , and my biggest complaint up until now has been that sometimes there are so many characters , it 's hard to keep them straight . in this book , that was the last of my worries . i did n't even finish it , i was so turned off
books	how would you like to have to perform your own autopsy ? that is the conundrum that faces dr. maura isles in body double when she returns from a conference in france to find that the identical twin she never knew she had has been murdered in front of her house . the investigation into the murder leads maura to a mental institution to confront the woman who gave the identical twins up for adoption 40 years before , and also leads maura into the chilling discovery that a serial killer has been murderng pregnant women . this book moves quickly as maura follows the investigation to its very surprising conclusion . it 's a pleasure to see maura team up with dr. jane rizzoli -- maura seems to take some of the hard edges off of jane and jane seems to make maura a little less of an ice princess . this is an enjoyable book that you will find is hard to put down until the end
books	i was very disappointed to discover that this book had a homosexual character . this is absolutely inappropriate for a young adult book , and unless a parent has read the reviews that mention it , said parent would have no clue as it sure is n't mentioned anywhere on the blurb in the book . i usually am more aware of what my daughter is reading , but this time this particular book slipped under my radar . she told me that it had a reference to a gay character , which i took to mean just a passing reference , but when i read the book , it was treated more seriously than i thought , even going so far as to have the two girls kiss . it is inexcusable , both on ms pierce 's part and on scholastic 's . no matter what the author 's personal beliefs , it is irresponsible to have this type of content without a warning to parents . i believe that as a parent , i 'm the one responsible for what my children see and do , but it sure helps to have some type of information so i can make an informed decision . anise hollingshea
books	i have yet to read a true grisham thriller , but i plan to in the near future . having said that , i have no idea how this compares , but i did n't really care for it . it 's cute and has a sort of slapstick humor that i could n't get into . i felt like i was reading a teen or children 's book , and i do n't like feeling so patronized when i read unless i knowingly pick up a picture book ready for the simplicity of a good message -- even then , i do n't usually feel patronized or `` written down to '' . it 's simple writing and a simple plot . it 's lighthearted and thus a light read . i imagine many people would enjoy it ; i just could n't get into it . : o
books	i started with the second volume , the mammoth book of more historical whodunnits , and enjoyed it so much that i went out and got a copy of this one as well . i really liked the time-span of story settings , and the best part was the mystery that was written down over 2000 years ago ! great for people who like short story mysteries , and as a lead-in to authors you might like
books	our book club read this book for our february 2006 selection . it was a really good book , we were all excited about discussing it . mr. johnson sent us discussion questions that really made us think . a few members felt that denmark never loved sierra but saw her more as property . the book definitely has some suprises that you do n't see coming . we really enjoyed the book . sistahs of ebony pages
books	as a young woman i was appauled by gurian 's lack of respect for women as human beings.what makes me the most furious is his shadowy writing which can lead a young woman to think she is only worth something if she squishes herself to allow the boys and men to take the lead in life.the resounding message is girls and women are potentially inferior and can not because of our hormones make important contributions to society beyond traditional roles.i do n't remember ever being taken over by hormones and rendered down to a emotional bundle of primative chemical reactions he believes all females to be . i agree with posters about this bridge brain foolishness.gurian is a master at twisting words around and you have to read his books being mindfull of his tricks.his book is full of agenda .
books	reinventing the bazaar used real-life examples to make markets understandable to any reader . from pharmaceutical companies to the tokyo fish market , mcmillan brings markets alive right in front of the readers ' eyes . he attempts to demystify the mystery behind markets , and in my opinion , he succeeds . each chapter presents a new market setting which mcmillan uses to illustrate his various points . while the book has an economic undertone , the level of writing is not above the understanding of even a high school student . all terminology is explained not only with words , but with examples , as well . the book was enjoyable , especially if you have little familiarity with various market settings . however , i would encourage anyone to read this book because even the experts on markets will have their knowledge enriched by this book
books	let me see how many books can i write to preach to the choir about the same thing . she must of got dumped by a handful of liberal boyfriends ( what intellegent person would want her ) and now she 's trying to get back at 'em . ca n't wait for the next `` i hate liberals so much and here are my reasons why '' book . she should join fox she would fit right in
books	this book was someone else 's bookclub selection , and i think having no expectations when i picked it up really helped in my having that wow experience that some folks report with this book and others miss . yes , the prose needed much better editing : overuse of repetition , `` stock '' phrases , and `` hanging '' assertions that should have been cleaned up . however , i found the discussions of brain development/evolution , similarities between certain animal behaviors and human behaviors , development of language in different animals , and the coevolution of humans and dogs to be facinating ( oops , just gave away the ending ! ) . i found the side discussion of outcome-based audits interesting and enlightening . i also liked dr. temple 's recommendation that people with autism be hired for baggage checking positions . great idea ! although the book really goes all over the place , i found it a wonderful opportunity to engage my `` seeking/hunting '' motivation ( you 'll have to read the book for that one ) , and worth wading through the flaws to pick up the nuggets of gold
books	i truly enjoyed northern lights . ms. roberts ways with words are so descriptive and it kept me going with the mystery and growing love between the two characters in this book . i truly enjoy nora roberts , she is an excellent writer . i can not wait to read more of her newer writings as well as her older writings .
books	only knowing jack canfield from the very successful `` chicken soup for the soul '' mega series , i had no idea his abilities as a motivational mentor and coach . although this book title seemed to be directed toward business success , the gems of this book can be used in every aspect of your life . this lengthy book is full of words of wisdom and wit . lines that will move you to tears of discovery or move you to change directions . a absolute must read book for understanding the real you
books	it is basically a short review of the great book written by zahn . i recommend the novel and this as a refresher for later times
books	this book started well , but fell flat in the middle . what little conflict there was in the beginning was resolved halfway through . even the shooting incident could n't manage to hold my interest because it was resolved so quickly . well , i did n't bother to finish it -- i have limited time for reading , and i do n't like to waste it .
books	at least this author mentions the `` mockery '' strategy martha/mdiddy tried to use to `` fog '' the public . the `` real issue '' of whether martha/mdiddy committed the crimes , and lack of an effort to encourage an answer to the question `` did martha stewart '' lie , demonstrates some complacency . is it this complacency martha/mdiddy and her pr team try to encourage and promote ? is it the `` greyness '' of white-collar crime that martha/mdiddy was trying to play on ? is society the ultimate judge about a person 's guilt or innocence ? if so , what has martha/mdiddy been judged ? be `` thoughtful '' ~shaw
books	probability and random processes can be easily approached with grace and elegance so long as the professor and/or writer possess such talents . all too often albert leon-garcia comes across as a total wacko in the possession neither
books	in this fully illustrated and remarkably brief book , hawking provides an overview of the state of theoretical physics at the dawn of the 21st century . the often dense text is supplemented by biographical details , witty asides , and ( especially ) luxuriously reproduced introductions . hawking covers a lot of territory in 200 pages ; he hopes to provide brief , non-intimidating summaries of recent concepts and new frontiers in science . there is astonishingly little text , and at times the pithiness , compactness , and occasional `` cuteness '' may work against readers ' understanding ; there 's perhaps too much shell and not enough nut here . some sections are so cursory that i suspect they will fail to make any sense at all to the untutored reader . ( this is especially true of several of the passages on imaginary time , event horizons , and brane world models . ) the text is aided greatly , however , by the beautifully rendered four-color illustrations . even if the concepts presented by these drawings seem fuzzy at first , the creativity and humor fused into moonrunner design 's artwork will attract , engage , and occasionally tease readers who might otherwise be frightened by the sight of a quadratic equation . overall , then , the book might have far more value as a refresher course for the beginner rather than as an introduction for the uninitiated . yet it 's certainly conceivable that somebody new to this material might be intrigued enough to explore these subjects further . if you 're looking for a book that will flesh out the concepts presented here , i strongly recommend ( as does hawking ) alan guth 's `` the inflationary universe '' or brian greene 's `` the elegant universe .
books	a wonderful wonderful book.although the book was written some 150 year ago , mary eliza rogers takes you into the intimacies of daily life in palestine in the 1850 's as if it was occurring today . she writes from her heart with honesty , integrity and a clear mind . and although written at a time of victorian prejudicies and colonialism she writes without bias or judgement . from her beautiful and colourful descriptions one can envisage the holy land as it was before undergoing the process of modernisation and change . for anyone who has any attachment to this land it is a truly wonderful and personal experience to read this book
books	this is by far my favorite novel by forster , and many rereadings have made it one of my favorite novels , period . in his first book , forster shows a subtlety and lightness of touch which i , at least , feel that he lost as he got more self-consciously `` philosophical '' in later books like howard 's end and a passage to india . he makes wonderful use of the italian settings and of italian art , bringing them to vivid life , undermining tourist cliches , and weaving them gracefully into his main themes . no other book i know balances romanticism and irony so perfectly
books	the novels in this series are not the escapist fantasies that many associate with the arthurian legends . they are , in fact , historical fiction at its best . whyte has gone to great lengths to not only ensure historical accuracy , but to weave the stories into historic events . the first six novels in the series ( that is all i have read , though it appears that there are two or three more ) give a wonderfully plausible explaination for the genesis of the arthurian legend . but the beauty of the books is in whyte 's prose . a scottish poet , he uses the language beautifully and creates characters so vivid and multidimensional that we forget the 1600 between their time and ours . these books will not insult your intelligence , and they prove that one does not need to suspend the laws of physics or distort the facts of history to find magic in the arthurian legend .
books	i tried as hard as i could but just could not get into this book . not quite as bad as her book , `` impossible , '' but close . danielle steel is getting so repetitive in her writing . basically , this book repeated over and over how much quinn liked sailing and how he neglected his wife throughout the years and that he did n't realize how much she meant to him until she was dying/dead . drivel . she could have elaborated on what was supposedly the storm of the century but ended it quickly or expanded on the characters themselves , but no . a waste of time . very hard to get through as there really is nothing there to get into at all . disappointing , to say the least .
books	after reading the trilogy , i was left wondering what the hell happened ? i have just read all 3 of the his dark materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book 1 and 2 is utterly demolished in this clunker . pullman allowed his eagerness to bash religion to completely destroy an engaging story - one of the most creative stories i 've come across in 20 years of reading fantasy . there is n't even a remote chance of a sequel to fix up this mess . if you look up `anticlimax ' in the dictionary , you 'll see a picture of this book . from first page to last , time is wasted on boring characters , while all the good ones are either killed off , or just mia for the entire book . spoilers ahead . what about lyra and her parents ? somehow , she never knows what happened to them and after all she has been through is supposed to be content with going back to school like a good little girl ? she never even confronts them to try and understand their motivations . and will just goes back with mary malone to her apartment so they can figure out how to avoid the cops . over a cup of tea , naturally . and that 's it for him . in addition to all that , this book does n't even seem to be connected to the first two . none of the characters resonate they way they used to and instead of being good friends , will and lyra fall in love and have sex at the tender age of 11 or 12 . . . all in the last 30 pages . what happened to the story , for cripes sake ? ! and what happened to the `temptation ' ? was choosing not to stay with will her way of not succumbing to it ? the whole premise is just so lame to start out with . as an earlier reviewer pointed out all the windows that were opened for centuries did n't endanger the universe , why not leave one open for 60 or 70 years to give lyra and will a chance to know each other . the flimsy reasoning behind this is just as contrived as their sudden and immediate love for one another . supposedly , they had more than gonads going for them , they survived death together ! pullman did n't feel like thinking it through , he just wanted a gut wrenching ending . in addition to that , he wanted to mock the reader by taunting us with the `reality ' of knowing that nothing they did in the trilogy has any hope or meaning . all of will and lyra 's efforts are futile , kind of like - guess what ? religion for the rest of us morons . after having the reader go through endless pages on the mulefa-elephant aliens or whatever , ultimately the characters the reader wants to know about disappear with barely a whimper . iorek byrnison , lee scoresby - instead we get page after page about mary malone the disaffected former nun . pullman all but pants in his eagerness to give the finger to anyone of us who believes in him or anything for that matter ! this is not children 's literature , it 's a hate ridden manifesto that is more suitable for adults who at least have some way of maintaining some sort of perspective throughout this sloppy mess . it 's totally dishonest to sell this as a children 's book , or even as a competent work of fiction . all of the painstaking work of the first two books is undone with this one . we never get closure on lyra 's parents . we never really understand what dust is and where it comes from . we never see will reunited with his mother . we get a lame battle where `god ' dies and no one even knows why or how . lyra and will fall in love , but have to `sacrifice ' it so that all the windows to other worlds can be shut forever , with only flimsy reasoning behind it . the mulefa and mary malone 's work together amounts to nothing , everyone just goes home . presumably , will goes home , although we never see it . all that yearning after his mother and so forth . . .nothing . the major enemies are killed off too easily - and what about armageddon ? what happened to the fortress and all the rebel angels and . . .you get the idea . it all just sort of disovles . mary forgot to be the serpent , or else i missed that in one of the countless pages on the mulefa . another reader pointed out : `` phillip pullman could have written a masterpiece with this series . instead , the story falls flat under the weight of the author 's own agendas and mockeries . what a waste of time . i ca n't believe this book actually won awards . it stopped being thought-provoking and started being inane and silly . '' it would have been better if lyra had just awakened one morning and it was all a dream . instead , relearning how to read the alethiometer will somehow enable her to build the kingdom of heaven in the course of her lifetime . absurd . this was one of the most disappointing and infuriating reads of my life .
books	this book serves the purpose of listing all available moves for the preset roster and shows all available storylines in the game . that 's about it . no instruction on create a wrestler , or for that matter , create anything . in fact , the previous two items i listed ( moves and storylines ) are pretty much the only content in this book . i do n't know ; maybe i 'm spoiled by prima and the good job they do writing for pc games . they just could have included a lot more content , that 's all . you could have found any old faq in 30 seconds of search-engine poking
books	i am a woman and was extremely offended at the portrayel of black men in this book and in the movie . the work offers no balance whatsoever which feels like a slap in the face . one black male in this book could have been something other than weak or cruel . it is no wonder spielberg was eager to take on the project and white people are going to the theater in droves . the castration of the black male has always been their main attraction , apparently oprah 's as well
books	the content is excellent . the digital format is largely useless . i bought the digital 5th edition to supplement my paper 4th edition . but , the digital rights management restrictions mean that i ca n't print selected pages to stick in a folder , read on the train , or scribble notes on . i ca n't even cut and paste particularly relevant bits into an electronic 'notes ' file . the onerous digital restrictions are not suitable for an academic book like this one
books	'the interface between the written and the oral ' is a comprehensive look at the development of writing in general and alphabets in particular , oral poetry in ancient greece and modern africa , oral transmission of ( written ) vedas , the impact of writing on recently oral cultures in west africa , and the impact of writing on our own abilities of thought and organization . perhaps the most disheartening , but nonetheless informative section , deals with the counterintuitive measures that social scientists have come up with to measure the impact of literacy . they seem to be lacking in common sense . goody , however , is full of common sense , and this book is excellent reading
books	i really did n't enjoy this book . i am half italian-american , and i 've read a few books about growing up in an italian-american family in an effort to learn about my roots . i have also read several books about 2nd generation americans struggling to find their identities while caught between what is `` normal '' and their immigrant parents . i normally enjoy such books , but not this one . i know that life was n't always a bowl of cherries for these familes , but this book makes it seem as if it was absolutely horrible . yet , i could n't find anything about the daughters ' lives that are really that bad or even different from many people 's lives in this country . where is all the anger coming from ? i really do n't know . this book is dark and depressing . some say it is funny at times , but i did n't think so . i could n't even bring myself to finish it
books	i liked the book but you also have to consider the end killer ... is that logical at all ? ? the senator is in his late fifties and so how old is his father ? if he had the senator when he was twenty he 'd have to be 77 . is it really reasonable that he 's running around killing people , and setting houses on fire . it was a very unlikely twist to the end . it still was a good book
books	ms milton admits to her anger at humanistic psychology , so she attacks without understanding . she does not seem to grasp even some of the basic concepts of the people 's work she denigrates . maslow 's hierarchy of needs is one example . i have spent a great deal pf time studding humanistic psychology and writings . i have had the pleasure of being trained in group therapy with carl rogers , and william coulson as instructors . any one who really studies these writers will see how bad a job ms milton did presenting them . she should have let her anger subside before she wrote the book . her bias is extreme and obvious . so consider this when reading the book . no doubt ms milton will have a new career appearing on the conservative religious programs . i am sure pat robinson and jerry falwell have or will book her to speak out against the evils of humanistic psychology
books	this was a fabulous resource for understanding the evolution of the marian cult . the one weakness of this book is that it did not deal with the pre-christian origins of the marian cult . other resources , however , cover the evolution of the anatolian fertility cult of cybele into the roman magna mater and later into the so-called `` bvm '' . the author does a good job of showing the origins of various aspects of mariology and contrasting these developments with christianity in the west . the author has done a great service to those who wish to more fully understand the syncretic process which blended christianity with various pagan religions and medeival political structures to create the roman catholic church
books	reading this book ten years after it was written made it very hard to get into it . for one thing , the author still talks about the ussr and east germany , and those countries faded away so long ago that the whole book seems dated . it 's hard to suspend disbelief and imagine this book was really written far in the future .
books	the content of this book is adequate , but the layout leaves much to be desired . the only way to find a chapter is through the table of contents . pages are not labeled with chapter information , such as which chapter that page belongs to . the content is often broken up with cases and excercises that divide paragraphs in half . this makes it very confusing to follow the flow of the book . you can be reading along and jump into a case or excercise without knowing it and become very confused . if the authors and publishers would rework the flow of the book , i would rate it much higher
books	some of the stuff in here was really screwy . it 's not a handbook to the `` food and mood '' book by elizabeth somer , which is what i thought it was when i bought it . it 's a separate program entirely . this one is too woozy and non-western for me . very little hard data to back up what they say , just kind of fruity and flowery
books	rather a funny novel , gets off to a slow start but the end is superb . worth reading
books	this book is packed full of incredible devices for any one who enjoys exalted . the book has a wealth of knolage from the first age as well as the age of sorrows . the book has a few sections in it that divide the items by uses , that is the only way i can discribe it . there is a giant amount of artifacts that have nothing to do with combat , and then others that are . there is a section on warstriders , basicly single man `` death machines '' that basicly look like large metal robots . most of the items in this volume are very well detailed and all have pictures that show you what they would more that likely look like . i do n't like saying that is what they look like because , well , this is rping people , things change by a player/gm 's perception . anyway , enough of my ramblings , this book rocks and has items that range from pens to armor to boots to royal class warstriders . this book is about gear in the world of exalted . p.s . it looks like there is going to be about 4 more of these books . my best guess is that one will be for sorcery , but that is just one book . if you think of anything else , post it here to give me some ideas on the other ones
books	we are in the last part of the 19th century in this novel , and the wild west has breathed its last . the book is peopled with real legends ( calamity jane , buffalo bill , sitting bull ) and fictional curiosities ( jim ragg and bartle bone - two mountain men , and no ears - an indian with exceptional eyesight ) . mcmurtry relates a sad , elegiac farewell to times past . the ever-interesting characters and their views of the world , which are wise and funny and fascinating , make the novel top-notch in the mcmurtry canon
books	eoghan casey 's text is immediately useful . it 's not theory , it 's practical . it 's not biased to one operating system , but covers several technologies . finally , eoghan and the book 's contributors do not gloss over today 's most offensive topics , they address them with vigor and solutions . i would share one concern : the chapter-long product/vendor discussion . some reviewers label it marketing ; other reviewers do n't mention it at all . i 'll just forewarn you that you will learn much more about encase or nfr than about their competitors . as a security consultant for hewlett-packard , it seems my bookshelf fills up entirely too easily , especially as of the last few years . therefore , i 've gotten fairly selective with new book purchases ( until i can get a new bookshelf ) . however , casey 's text is definitely worth getting - worth knocking another book off to make room . : ) i hope you enjoy this comprehensive text at least half as much as i do
books	a good friend of mine insisted i 'd read this book , because she knows i love exploring the spiritual aspects of life . in the end i was very disappointed . not in the writing or the exploration aspects of the book , but michael crichton 's whole attitude . he would spend a chapter sharing his learnings and his eye opening experiences , only to revert back to his arrogant , narrow-minded attitude once again for the next chapter . how can anyone claim they 've learned anything in life when nothing they learn from it seems to sink in ? sadly , this book left me with a very bad taste in my mouth . i have no desire to read any more of his books
books	with every grisham book i read , i get more and more impressed with his ability to not only use the law to create suspense , but to insert other elements to make this human as well . for once , we have a character that is not consumed by financial gain . however , this person has been left most of an eleven billion dollar fortune . however , she does not know this . a lawyer is sent to find her , and in the process , undergoes a fundamental change of his own . this story takes place in washington , maryland , west virginia , and the rain forests along the brazilian-bolivian border . in typical grisham fashion , he inserts considerable detail in all of the venues of this book , enabling the reader to create a mental picture everywhere this story goes . you can picture the six heirs that are clawing to get their share of the millions . you can picture the judge itching to have a high profile fight . you can envision the rainforest , and you can picture in your mind the massive changes occurring in the life of nate o'riley . this is yet another grisham work that will simply stick to your fingers like glue . the pages literally turn themselves . do not start this novel before going to bed , or you may have a sleepless night simply for the fact you simply will not be able to put this one down .
books	when i first discovered this book in a london bookshop , i decided at once that i needed to own it . it 's large , it 's bulky , but it 's beautiful . it needs the large pages to illustrate the finest examples of tom 's works . as an artist myself , who learnt a lot from tom 's unique techniques , i appreciate what a fantastic collection of art , both colour and black and white , has been compiled into this collection . but it 's not just pictures ; there 's an insight into the man himself , a delightful tribute to the master of homoerotic art . this volume is a great tribute to tom and a valuable tool for the new breed of erotic artists , like myself , waiting for recognition
books	this book places too much emphasis on spending money instead of eating ... well if we all had money to burn that would be a wonderful lifestyle . read `` the fat fallacy '' instead , it provides much more practical information
books	noah webster 's book is fascinating reading for today 's students and teachers alike , as well as for the average citizen , as there is much to learn from it . while it may be inappropriate to resurrect it as an official school text , it certainly has a place in every school library . one of the most notable features is the comprehensive phonetic system used , with diacritical marks ( accents ) applied to all relevant vowels and consonants ; words are divided according to syllables and stress . it also spells the names of letters of the alphabet ; something which tends to be ignored in modern teaching . the terminology of traditional grammar is used , and there are copious word lists , with words grouped according to common factors . i have no hesitation in recommending this book to all students of the english language for the above reasons and for many other interesting aspects ( now-archaisms : thy/thou ... ; foreign words and phrases ; abbreviations explained ; punctuation ; etc ) . this book should remain a spelling classic
books	at first , i found this book to be difficult to digest because it appeared to be heading in a direction that was in sacrilegious conflict with my beliefs as a christian and a catechist in the catholic church . yet a part of me was also highly fascinated and captivated by the story , especially since i work as a mental health professional . as i keep reading , i discovered that it was n't sacrilegious at all but rather a story of general faith and hope , of the extent a mother would go through to protect her child , and of the intrusive nature of the media . i particularly liked the strength mariah showed during this conflict , despite her past history of nervous breakdown . and i like the way the character of ian evolved from a sleazy teleaetheist to a caring and more moral man . the secondary characters were all wonderful , in particular mariah 's mother and the lawyers on both side . i thought the trial was once of the most interesting parts of the story . as with all picoult books , this was a deep and heavy novel which was n't easily breezed through , but it was definitely a compelling and awesome book to read !
books	i can not stand this book . i ca n't even finish reading it . kevin j anderson can not write original star wars books at all . the only thing i have ever seen with his name on it that was entertaining was the dark lords of the sith comic book . everything he writes is unoriginal and lacking in story . he seems to have some obsession with death stars and world destroyers because all he seems to put in his books are those . darksaber , jedi search , dark apprentice , champions of the force , heck even the ig-88 story he wrote for tales of the bounty hunters had the death star tied in ( ig-88 transfers himself into the death star ... what the heck ? ) seriously , this book is not worth it . try timothy zahn or michael stackpole . at least they do n't always use death stars . and while zahn 's last 3 books are based around thrawn , the original heir to the empire , dark force rising and the last command , when thrawn first appeared , was not him dry humping the same concept over and over
books	as i began to read this book , i was reminded of jack dempsey 's observation that `` champions get up when they ca n't . '' all of us have encountered professional setbacks of one kind or another and some of them are especially difficult to overcome . most of the examples which jeffrey sonnenfeld and andrew ward cite in this book involve ceos who either `` fired back '' and eventually prevailed after a career setback ( e.g . donald trump , martha stewart , bernie marcus , jimmy carter , and george foreman ) or never fully recovered from them ( e.g . jill barad , john scully , leona helmsley , jacques nasser , and linda warnaco ) . the former demonstrate the importance of `` seven lessons to turn tragedy into triumph '' which sonnenfeld and ward recommend ; the latter demonstrate the probable consequences of failing to understand and then apply those lessons on which a five-step strategy - `` for rescuing and restoring a career and reputation after a devastating professional setback '' -- is based . it would be a disservice to sonnenfeld and ward as well as to those who read this brief commentary if i were to list the `` lessons '' and `` steps '' which are best revealed within the narrative of this remarkably thoughtful , eloquent , and practical book . each is anchored in a real-world context . each is relevant to anyone now embarked upon or preparing for a professional career . i mention this last point because some who consider purchasing this book may incorrectly assume that its material will be of greatest value only to senior-level executives . on the contrary , all of sonnenfeld and ward 's observations and recommendations can be of substantial benefit to anyone who wishes to ( a ) avoid `` a devastating professional setback '' or ( b ) recover from one . in essence , this book provides sonnenfeld and ward 's response to this question : `` how can i overcome a professional setback ? '' to their credit , at no time do they minimize or trivialize the impact of a professional setback . ( presumably each has experienced a few of his own . ) they fully appreciate the difficulty of overcoming the debilitating psychological stress of failure , the challenges of failure to one 's reputation ( both personal and professional ) , social biases about failure , and other challenges which may be unique to one 's company , its culture , and its industry . if not `` tragic '' or `` devastating , '' a setback almost always lowers one 's self-esteem , is embarrassing , and has adverse financial consequences . more often than not , there is collateral damage to one 's family members and/or to one 's close colleagues at work so guilt also comes into play . recall the dempsey quotation provided earlier . presumably sonnenfeld and ward agree with dempsey on the importance of courage and also with me that it is much easier to summon the courage to `` get up '' when you are convinced that the situation is not hopeless , and , that you can indeed recover if you understand what has happened , why it has happened , and how you can - and should -- respond to it . of course , it is preferable to avoid a setback in the first place . ( `` if `ifs ' and `buts ' were fruits and nuts ... . '' ) most of us are not so fortunate and i , for one , have learned the most important lessons from failures ( mine and others ' ) rather than from successes . whether or not a given failure is our `` fault , '' it is certainly our responsibility to take full advantage of the learning opportunity it offers , and then to make positive and productive use of whatever truth has been revealed . it is interesting to examine the lives of `` great leaders [ who ] rebound after career disasters '' but , in my opinion , it is imperative to examine with rigor and candor one 's own values , attitudes , and behavior - especially when struggling to understand and then recover from a professional setback which is invariably a personal setback , also . as sonnenfeld and ward make crystal clear , this journey of personal discovery is by no means easy . nonetheless , it is one which must be initiated with commitment and then sustained by persistence throughout one 's life . if and when setbacks occur - and they always do - the practical advice which sonnenfeld and ward offer in this book will enable those who absorb and digest it to understand and ( yes ) accept what has happened , understand why it has happened , and then leverage that wisdom effectively and productively , not only in their careers but in their personal lives
books	this is the worst textbook i have ever bought for any class ! it is a huge waste of money and super frustrating to read . this book is horribly written . the explanations are boring , drawn out , and unclear . the early chapters draaaag on forever . the later chapters get a little better , but they state a lot of obvious or useless information . i have spent hours and weeks studying from this text and learned very little .
books	i am extremely dissapointed with this new edition of the text and have one advise only : if you own 2nd ed. , do not indulge in this new edition for even the errors ( spellings for one ) are xeroxed onto the new edition . therefore , for a review of the text itself , you may , without any compunction , refer to 2nd ed . 's comments , of which there are many
books	having read detective comics # 471-479 in the 70s done by this same creative team , i picked this up , hoping for more of the same . what a let-down ! i have to ask - what happened ! ? the art on those erstwhile 70s issues was the finest , most detailed art i 'd ever seen in a comic-book . i think that was due mostly to the inking of terry austin . when he was working on x-men , he gave john bryne 's pencils that fine detail as well . has austin done a 'gil kane ' and given up his nib-and-ink to work with marker-pen ? this dark detective series shows none of the fine-ness of his previous work . you only have to compare the 'flash-backs ' of this series to the original detective comics issues to see that something is wrong . maybe austin or rogers are getting older , but the artwork is very basic , and lacks the sheen they used to produce . the art sometimes actually reminded me of bob kane 's early work . the story also is a little unbelievable . it portrays bruce as a love-sick puppy and just does n't ring true . also , the lettering is - well , it 's been hand-done , by rogers i surmise , and is quite uneven . it should have been done by computer . i 'm sorry - i so wanted to like this , but it 's nothing like the calibre of work that this creative team produced in their glory days of the 70s .
books	as a frequent reader of home design books and magazines , the title and the beautiful cover of this book immediately appealed to me . a quick review of the table of contents revealed that i had to have this book . pelosi begins with the basics , moves into specifics , and then focuses on those special challenges we all face when trying to make our homes beautiful and appealing without spending a fortune . the pictures are gorgeous and inspiring and the author has an ability to write clearly and concisely with a great sense of humor . whether you are looking for a single design solution or , like me , enjoy reading about interior design , this is the book for you ... and it makes a great gift for your friends and family and colleagues and anyone who lives in a home . `` interior divine '' made my holiday shopping easier this year !
books	this is the latest in a never-ending series of books trying to generalize non-business world ( eg . sports , armed forces , girl scouts , religion , nasa , etc . ) management techniques to the business world . most , possibly all , are of little value because of major differences . 1 ) members constituting the varying organizations are motivated differently , and face greatly significantly different situations . what does eg . a fighter pilot or football coach have in common with a pharmicist , nurse , professor , financial analyst , etc. ? i have no idea . 2 ) key success factors vary from one business to another . for merck , it may be speed of developing new drugs , getting through fda approval , and motivating physicians to use them . for nucor steel , it undoubtedly rests much more on low-cost production . again , what does either have to do with fighter pilots - little , if anything . one is better off reading books from similar situations - eg . about wal-mart ( if you are in retailing ) , about allied-signal or g.e . ( if you are managing a conglomerate ) , and about new york community school district # 4 , as managed by sy fliegel , if you are in public school
books	the book is not 'really ' on christ in the etheric , but more several - `` unrelated '' - lectures about etheric life . sometimes christ only gets mentioned at the very end of a lecture . the book can be summed up as an accumalation of lectures of `` cosmic life '' if you like : the spiritual life that is connected with , and influences , life as seen only from/with physical senses . in the book is recorded about several `` ages '' ( golden age , silver age , iron age and dark age ) , and that how in each age clairvoyant abilities - [ or really spiritual consciousness ] - diminished with each age , and that the dark age has ended in 1899ac and that in this current age people need to become spiritually aware again to the point where they have a `` damascus experience '' ( experience of saul - later paul - in which he saw christ in etheric form ) . people who do not become spiritually aware will be bound into the earth consciousness/sphere and could cause disturbances in the earth . in this light , rudolf steiner communicated about the brotherhoods - in western and eastern countries - and how they try to prevent people from developing spiritually to the point where they will be able to meet christ in the etheric ( = 2nd coming of christ ( coming in the etheric ) ... and in future times coming of christ ( i.e . manifestation/presence of christ in the astral ) ) . in the book is also recorded about the sermon on the mount - with the beautitudes ( recorded in matthew 5 ) where jesus communicated about the development of the soul ( as recorded in other books by rudolf steiner ( sentient soul , intellectual soul , etc. ) ) . in the book is also recorded about `` the afterlife '' if you like : life of souls who have passed away and are still earthbound , and how those souls are connected to those souls that are incarnated in a physical body in earth . in the book is communicated about different levels in the 'afterlife ' and how feelings and will are active . it is recorded about astral plane , lower devachan and higher devachan in `` etherization of the blood '' and later on again in `` three realms between death and rebirth '' where is recorded in greater detail how activity in those realms is connected with life of souls incarnated in the earth and how christ is also present there and can be experienced in earthly life as 'destiny ' ... and how people are so focused on what is , or has happened , but do n't pay attention to what is result of it not happening ( e.g . getting delayed for an appointment , or coming ( 'unexpectedly ' ) too early etc. ) . destiny is at work , with christ having its workings present in it according to rudolf steiner . in the book is also located about `` the double '' and how forces from within the earth influence it [ geo-biology ] . ireland was a place where those influences where most 'healthy ' for spiritual development/cognition and ireland was the place where christianity was able to flourish and waver out from to europe by irish monks
books	i truly wanted to like this book . after years of avoidance i had just finished moby dick and found it not only more readable than i 'd feared but downright enjoyable . in addition i 'd heard nothing but good things about this novel whose premise certainly intrigued me , and like its predecessor it has one of the truly great opening lines in literature : `` captain ahab was neither my first husband nor my last . '' alas , it was all down hill from there ; overall this is one of the worst books i 've ever forced myself to finish . this came as quite a surprise because the author is no untalented hack . author of two other published novels and a short story collection , director of a university level creative writing program , long-term teacher of writing , and holder of a ph.d. in same , all to considerable critical acclaim , she should be correcting and grading ( failing ) garbage like this not producing it . so what went wrong ? how did this novel end up so awful ? the answer is brick by brick and piece by piece . there is no one great thing wrong with it but rather a lot of little things . length : if `` brevity is the soul of wit '' , this novel 's witlessness is easily explained . at 666 pages ( interesting number that ) this novel is about three times as long as it should have been . it would seem that , to some extent like melville before her , naslund confused length with importance , but melville was a lot more skilled at padding than she is . imho this desire to fill too many pages made many of the other problems worse by allowing naslund both to go into unnecessary detail about things no one else cares about and to repeat herself to the point of self-parody . somewhere under the barnacle encrustations may be the finely lined hull of a short novel , but this was a manuscript desperately in need of editing ... with a meat axe or a chainsaw . the name dropping : one of the pleasures of any historical novel is the encounters between fictional characters and historical figures , but if badly handled these encounters can un-suspend disbelief and downright offend . they are badly handled here . an almost uneducated hick from the backwoods of kentucky encounters by chance a significant number of the thoughtful elites of mid-nineteenth century new england and those she does n't utterly charm with her brilliance and erudition she gets the better of as in her unintentionally hilarious encounter with naslund 's peculiar imagining of nathaniel hawthorne . one or two of these , developed at greater length could have added to the verisimilitude . as it is , it is a zelig or a forrest gump without the humor ( or the self-awareness ) . the politics : even the most conservative readers would probably find the popular views of a majority of mid-nineteenth century new englanders a bit disconcerting if espoused straight in a modern novel , so a certain amount of modernizing would be appropriate just to reduce the cringing . however , naslund takes this to the opposite extreme by having una espouse the politically correct view on every single controversy of the day ( and some that only exist in our significantly sillier day ) from slavery to whaling , from feminism to free love , from homosexuality to sensitivity towards the differently abled , all without consequence or even criticism . this latter is the most offputting because to have actually championed such views back then would have taken considerable courage whatever one thinks of the ideas themselves . una espouses them with all the negative consequences that naslund receives for espousing them today , which is to say : none . the anti-christian bigotry : there is nothing so very wrong with characters in a mid-nineteenth century novel exhibiting agnosticism or atheism as both views were gaining more and more credence at the time , but it is downright silly to suggest that such views would have been widely accepted . it is even sillier to portray christianity as something confined exclusively to the foolish , the bigoted , the future apostate , or the mentally ill . it tells us more about the author than anything else that una is openminded towards every religious and quasi-religious idea of the time except christianity . the farfetched scenarios : i sensed the novel was in trouble during the opening scene in which una loses both her mother and her baby but manages to withstand this blow by making friends with a runaway slave with whom she has a quasi-lesbian encounter ... . after this the novel goes into flashback and becomes unrealistic . after her crazy christian father threatens to kill her ( a sentiment the reader will come to know and understand ) , una is raised in a lighthouse by her ludicrously liberal-minded aunt and uncle , encounters two young men who both fall in love with her , disguises herself as a cabin boy and sails on the same whaler with them , successfully avoids detection , is sunk by a whale , survives by committing cannibalism , marries the surviving young man after he goes insane , and is abandoned by him after he goes to live with the indians , leaving her free to `` marry '' captain ahab ( una never really `` marries '' anybody but of course nobody ever criticizes ) . things do n't get more realistic in the second half , which includes una 's clever and successful investment in the crazy newfangled idea of obtaining oil from the ground instead of from a whale . riiiight . the mary sue : however , the absolute worst thing about this novel is the fact that it is a `` mary sue '' that peculiarity of fan fiction in which a laughably idealized and practically perfect in every way alter ego of the author fulfills some basic psychological need while inducing a combination of anger and nausea in the reader . a more realistic main character might have saved it . una never learns anything from her life 's too-many-to-be-believed experiences because she already knows everything . she does n't change because she is already perfect . she does n't have to deal with the criticism of others because she does n't receive any , and she does n't have to beg the forgiveness of those she has wronged because they forgive her so easily and besides , una had her reasons ( and they were very good ones you can be sure ) . the only thing i can figure is that her publisher approved this book on concept alone without anyone ever reading it . i feel like i 've just waded through the inept scribbling of a delusional teenage girl who insists on rereading moby dick in her bedroom ... with the door locked .
books	well written and fully documented . i confess that i knew very little about the beginings of islam or its constant bloodshed . anywhere islam becomes entrenched , freedom is taken away and civilizations are destroyed . hatred is not discouraged but encouraged . islam 's world view is this in a nutshell , do it our way or perish . this book will rob you of your sleep
books	the title says it all . one can do better w/ appleyard 's book
books	disappointed . as an english teacher , i expected a more compelling and less hokey use of whitman . the first story , of the deformed whitman loving boy , was utterly unbelievable and the continuity was incredibly challenging
books	there 's no much to say about this book . everything is already said . and it is still the best book in the field . well done , nancy ! ! ! sead malicevic , m
books	dr. hawkins first book , power vs force was interesting and presented a useful way to dowse using kinesiology . however , he began to venture into misapplication of this method , and has now gone off on a tangent where he seems to wish to delude himself into thinking he has developed a fool-proof way to judge the level of consciousness of any entity , concept , or construct and the truth or falsehood of any statement . there are serious logical , philosophical , and practical flaws in his work , and his attempt to quantify matters that are n't quantifiable leads to meaningless data that probably matches the bias beliefs of those carrying out the muscle tests . this book is a good example to present to show how people can deceive themselves and misuse muscle testing and dowsing techniques . the actual technique is worthwhile , but much of what hawkins presents in the book is utterly meaningless and invalid . the levels of awareness that can be tapped into with dowsing are wise enough to not let us ask just anything we wish to and be able to receive accurate , valid answers . hawkins explores issues about media , politics , religion , spirituality , history , philosophies , healing arts , entertainment , and more , and reveals his own gross ignorance on many matters . he seems unaware that many of the people he trusts in politics and media are professional gangsters , liars , and two-faced sociopaths . he has a negative view of conspiracy theorists , many of whom are genuinely determined to find the truth and do n't resort to hawkins ' misguided shortcut attempt to identify truth . hawkins also fosters confusion with his description of his muscle test method , as it really has little to do with applied kinesiology , but is a form of dowsing where the muscle is directed to remain weak or strong in lieu of muscle response moving a pendulum or rod . i hope hawkins gets to reconsider his current efforts ... consciousness and spiritual research are vital endeavors and there are others doing useful , responsible work in those areas . for now i 'd encourage hawkins to recognize that 911 was in part an inside job , many conservative politicians and pundits are corrupt frauds , and the overall maturity of consciousness in america is not greater than the rest of the world
books	this book gives a thorough analysis on how public policies were the catalysts for the socioeconomic destruction of low-income communities of color in new york city . necessary reading for those who still do not realize that activism and organizing are important vehicles through which marginalized communities keep in check the forces that seek to further fragment and disenfranchise them
books	i read desperation and enjoyed it immensely much like i did with the regulators also . this book is filled with suspense from page one . the book never drags in my opinion . this book though is not for the faint of heart . if you do n't enjoy high body counts and gore then you will not like this book and will most likely put it down by the second chapter . but if you do n't mind it at all like me you will enjoy the suspense he gives you and the twists and turns this book takes . the ending is by far the most suspenseful part . i also recommend reading desperation first because you will probably understand it better and get a better look on what tak is all about . the journal entries and newspaper articles are a very nice touch to the story and it lets you understand what is going on alot better also . i wish there was a part three to this but sadly there is n't . i ca n't choose between desperation and regulators because their both great but the regulators does have the more suspenseful end to it . although it is alot bloodier and may you even get a brief lump in your throat like i did when a tragic thing happens in the end . keep up the good work king
books	this book is a really excellent source for anyone wanting to understand the reasons that saudi arabia is the way it is today . i was lucky to find my copy in a used bookstore . it does get a little tedious when discussing the business/oil aspects of the 1960 's and 70 's , but it 's well worth it . it 's a detailed history from start until publishing and that is definitely a relevant time .
books	pojman does a superb job of illustrating many different approaches to ethics , providing examples of practical application of each . this helps the reader develop a critical mind , capable of reasoning his or her way through ethical dilemmas that we all face on a daily basis . pojman is not afraid to go for the jugular on approaches in which he finds serious flaws , such as cultural and ethical relativism . the reader will find that pojman does not adhere to one ethical theory in particular , but rather calls for reason and judgment , based on strong moral principles , in every situation . some situtations call for a utilitarian approach , some for a virtue-ethical approach . whatever approach he takes , however , will be based in thorough and sound reasoning . this book makes its readers want to be better people .
books	i 'm writing this before reading the whole book but its a collection of articles so the different chapters are discrete units under a common theme of the economies of the arab world with a good deal on the economies of their oil producing gcc members . reading this book more than twenty years after it was published is fascinating as so many of the issues and repercussions mentioned have either come true or held true and the state of the region has not improved considerably but even regressed in many cases . consider the following excerpt from the book that i found interesting : `` the oil states today face tremendous challenges , as oil revenues start to decline . few expected that the decline would come so soon . everybody knew it would come , but it was expected later rather than sooner . '' this is almost like seeing history repeat itself in real time . worth a look if you 're interested in the field
books	i love how many people like to say that lawrence walsh was a republican . funny . he was an eisenhower republican worlds removed from the conservative movement . and let 's face it : he stink bombed george h.w . bush at the end of the 1992 campaign when bush was gaining ground on clinton . i 'm not saying bush would have won if walsh had n't indicted caspar weinberger on the friday before the election , but walsh made a next-to-impossible task unattainable for bush . bush got him back , of course , by pardoning weinberger on christmas eve , 1992 . the beginning of the book was interesting to say the least . as it wore on , however , it became a prosecutor hoping to go down in history whining about republicans . let 's face it : people in power tend to be corrupt . they have protection the rest of us do n't have . this was n't just true about reagan and bush ; it 's true about clinton and whoever you wish to name . about halfway through the book , walsh concentrates his fire on the guy who was vp at the time , ghw bush . i also find the fact it was endorsed by a number of liberals interesting to say the least . i guess when you ca n't beat a guy at the ballot box , you impeach him or at least try to . right ? not worth the investment of time or money - but does have some good historical information inside .
books	i got this book when it first came out and read it straight away.i absoloutely loved it and highly reccomend it.lief is trying to be a great ruler , but ca n't , not with the famine and death in deltora.but with a perilious map , our heroes set out to destroy the four sisters that are causing the deaths in deltora.an exceptional addition to the previous books and is reccomended to fans who want a little more adventure in their reading.well done emily rodda ! i like this book as much as all the others , this is the best deltora series and i say it proudly , but after all , deltora quets has n't finished , not yet
books	this book is undoubtedly very good value for a birding handbook ( certainly by european standards ) . but the physical packaging is a total disaster . it has a ridiculously rigid spine and tiny page margins . it is difficult to read text near the spine , and virtually impossible to keep the book open on a particular page . the most unuseable book i 've ever experienced
books	this `` book '' is probably the worst written i 've ever encountered . it was so flawed as to be considered literature . alice walker tries to `` one-up '' harriet beecher stowe , in writing about brutality . titles like these are weapons used in the anti-black male agenda this society has long perpetuated . all the men depicted in this book are one-dimensional characters with absolutely no redeeming qualities worth noting . the women are portrayed as martyred , forlorn , pseudo-saints who have been set upon by beasts from hell . the only persons capable of any sort of humanity are exclusively women . i 've learned long ago , when absolutes such as these are presented , a greater agenda is at work . there are no `` real '' men in this book ! only distorted caricatures of black masculinity . i only found value in this book as a comprehensive example of sexist misandry at its worst . i find this title as dangerous as hitler 's `` mien kampf '' , in it 's portrayal of black men as evil and morally destitute . presenting such depictions is both dangerous and irresponsible . true , there are criminally abusive men in every culture . but there are also forthright , upstanding men as well . to present a depiction of such vehement imbalance and disparity , only serves to distort the readers view of the people being written about . harriet beecher stowe 's fictional `` uncle tom 's cabin '' , sparked national outrage and eventually a bloody civil war . this title does no less in further distorting the readers perceptions of black men . this book is fiction . however , it is not presented as such . i 'm sure the abusive incidents depicted in this book have been based upon actual incidents . i have no qualm about outrage at such abominations . however , i do have a problem when there are absolutely no upstanding male figures who intervene in such aberrations . that is what i find so unbelievable and offensive about this book . in my opinion , this novel does nothing to laud the strength of women so much as it demeans and distorts the readers/viewers of the people within it . i do n't find it a testament to the strength of black women at all . i interpret this book as feminist misandry with two purposes ... the further distortion of african-american culture and the deliberate depiction and denigration of the black male as being hopelessly inhuman . i 'm sure alice walker made a lot of money with this book . feminist , racist extremism seems to have found a niche in literature . i wonder if this novel would have had the same accolades , were it a fictional depiction of white american men brutalizing white women . most definitely not ! ! ! i doubt it would have even found a publisher . america is comfortable reinforcing negative depictions of black men and african-american culture . my life as a black man is difficult enough living as a testament and example against this sort of racial distortion . whatever ms. walker 's motivations were in writing this novel , i 'm sure mercenary incentives were not discounted . this is racist , misandrist propaganda masquerading as literature !
books	this is not the book to learn the basics of vbscript , but it 's exactly what i needed ; a good reference book . i got tired of trying to find syntax of commands and functions online . now i have it at my fingertips
books	fifteen years ago i purchased this book for the first time . today i am buying it as a gift for my son . i feel i am giving him the gift of life all over again . even though i raised all my children with vitamin c added to their diets , he seems to have fallen off the `` juice '' wagon ! linus pauling was not only brilliant but clear and concise . i only wish i had known he published a book on quantum mechanics a long time ago . i shall purchase that too at last and maybe i shall have an inkling of what it is all about
books	black metropolis is perhaps the founding document of african-american studies , a classic work of sociology that still resonates today . it is a paradigmatic expression of the chicago school of sociology , however , a school that today stands in some disrepute , at least in some circles . indirectly , it was the target of james baldwin 's famous attack on richard wright in his essay , everybody 's protest novel . the claim of the criticism has been that the chicago school , due to its insistance upon using a `` scientific approach '' , merely reproduces the very terms under which african-americans have been oppressed -- a claim that has proceeded under the warrant of european intellectuals such as theodor adorno . still , black metropolis is a landmark study , and , unfortunately , many if not most of its observations and conclusions remain true today , and in fact it could be argued that conditions in the black belt of chicago have gotten worse , not better , since 1945 , the year of black metropolis ' publication -- which lends a certain credence to the criticisms mentioned above , though perhaps it should be qualified by saying that they are not so much criticisms of the chicago school as they are criticisms of american society . since then , as we know , we have witnessed a great shift in american public opinion away from what some consider to be the excesses of those days ; so much so , in fact , that the work of black metropolis may again be regarded as a profoundly useful book . embodying american liberalism as it does -- which counted as a grave sin thirty years ago -- black metropolis may possibly be due for a fresh look
books	bob quinn is definitely one of the most profound writers on change in this era . but his work is not for the faint of heart because he challenges each of us to start change initiatives in the place we 'd least like to go -- inside ourselves . i found this an incredibly powerful book . i 've used sections of it with my `` change management '' classes for several years and i know it has a tremendous impact on students , who like most managers have grown up unconsciously believing that change always needs to start with the other guy . if you want a simple formula for change , do n't buy this book . although it is full of practical , actionable ideas , `` change the world '' addresses change at a profound level that asks readers to reflect seriously on what they stand for . it 's a very difficult but rewarding assignment
books	i have read all of sandra brown books . i was disappointed in this one . i have almost all of her books in my bookcase , but when i finished this one i gave it away .
books	i would recommend the power of simplicity to everyone . this book goes far beyond a discussion of marketing strategy . the idea of simplicity is relevent to all aspects of life . this book is full of useful information and contraversial suggestions pertaining to marketing strategy . although the book is considered an educational read , i feel that it is extremily entertaining as well . it 's just an interesting book , it doesnt get much simpler than that
books	this is by far my 2 year old son 's favorite book and he has lots of them . whenever it 's time to read to him he says `` toot toot '' and i know that means he wants to have this book read to him , sometimes several times in a row . the illustrations are wonderful , and there is all sorts of stuff going on if you look closely . an all around great , fun book , i highly recommend this book
books	this is a tough read . he gets so bogged down in the details that i forgot what i was reading about
books	i try to read items that i would not necessarily agree with . however , this piece of doggerel is nothing but exagerrations , misquotes , and spin . she uses tacky research to make points that do n't exist , then brushes off any critique as `` liberal bias '' . if you are a conservative , please read something that will allow us to discuss matters . coulters ' book should be titled `` slander : liberal lies i made up .
books	first of all , i did not exactly 'read ' this biography . instead i purchased the cd version which i distilled via my car sound system every morning on my way to work ( i have enjoyed countless biographies of great american figures this way , and still been able to read many more technology related books ) . i had great expectations from this book , having recently enjoyed three biographies of lincoln . i have to confess that i was sorely disapointed . i found the research of mr mccullough to lack the kind of details that i have enjoyed in biographies from walter isaacson , richard carwardine , or doris goodwin . i do not seek a beautiful story in a biography , but rather a reliable source of facts that i can use to form my own opinion of a character . in this context , i find mr mccullough 's use of superlatives or long emotionally charged sentences to be a distraction from the subject matter of john adams and his contribution to america . i also enjoy direct quotes from letters , speaches , autobiographies , as they help me refine my impressions of the context ( the period , the relationships to contemporary characters , ... ) surounding a promonent figure . usage of the english language in politics has dramatically evolved since mr adams ' time , and i missed 'hearing ' the voice of john adams . instead , this biography felt like reading a translation where the personality of the translator overshadows the personality of the original author . finally , having read other biographies of the founding fathers , i was disapointed to find so little about the complex relationship between adams and franklin . all in all , my lasting impression is that mr mccullough did a great job at bringing john adams and the early american revolution to the masses through a very appealling product that may however leave readers asking for more historical details and less emotional opinions . had i known that , i might have passed on this biography and instead explore mr mccullough 's fictional work
books	each story has a different author ... however they all use the same verbage . their either all friends or the same person . i do not like this book nor does my husband
books	i agree with the last reader . i did n't finish this book , it was so boring . nothing happened . and the characters were annoying . i read a lot of books that are n't action-oriented and like them . but this one was awful
books	i have been studing leadership for over 15 years both by reading and experience . i consider this book to be the best book i have read because it describes leadership as a learned activity . it also says that leadership is in motivating people to do their own work in solving difficult problems . i found that as president of my congregation i was continually going back to the concepts in the book to lead it through a very difficult situation involving placement of the flags in the sanctuary . it was very difficult to get people to do their own work and not try to step in to solve everything . ( that would have been impossible anyway ) i found that he described president lyndon johnson as a successful leader ( civil rights ) and unsuccessful leader ( vietnam ) . his discussion on leading without authority is new ground for me . if you want to discuss the book with others there is an on-line book study at the work and worship institute website . i found it was a good way for me to get more from the book . this is a great book with great stories of a variety of leaders in our society .
books	i believe that the purpose of this book is to break the bad habbits that every single christian had adoptded and the negative infuences we 've been absorving . i think that this book was made simple , so that it would be very easy to read , understand , use and remember the `` be 's '' . it does not anti with anything , it 's just conservative with what is believed to be true ! it 's inspiring that would help anyone who reads to envision grabbing your dreams and on how lucky we are to be in this generation with full of opportunities . every chapter gives wisdom why do we have to be ; grateful , smart , involve , clean , true , positive , humble , still and prayerful
books	my son loves to read , and he adores this book . i personally love trapani 's books -- while they are not always grammatically correct ( the only reason why i do n't give it a 5 star rating ) , they are beautifully illustrated and bring to life some of the most well-known nursery rhymes . it will bring a smile to your child 's face
books	chris bohjalian is a gifted stylist , and it pains me to give this book such a low mark . it 's hard to say much without giving away the plot , but i found the plot contrived and manipulative -- too clever for its own good . the book started strong , but as the main character became more disassociated with reality , i became more disassociated with the book . i finished it , but it was a struggle
books	this book disappointed me after reading martins letters . although this book provides a very different angle on value investing and has some useful ideas the writing style is poor and lacks clarity . there are much better books on analysing companies i suggest financial statement analysis by martin fridson and fernando alvarez .
books	this is a good book , but most are under the impression that einstein actually created the content of the book . einstein actually compiled the physics theories of the latest german and italian physicists and wrote it as his entire theory . for instance , e=mc^2 was not created by einstein , as so many people people . an italian physicist came up with it . if you do n't believe me check any encyclopedia . einstein suceeded in taking everyone 's work and compiling it . this was helpful to the world of physics . unfortunately , this stuff is outdated , and autodynamics has disproven many things that einstein says in this book . when it came out it was already outdated . this was published in the 60s . autodynamics disproved what is in this book in the 40s ( 45 i believe ) . if this was published in the 20s or even the 30s , it would have been a good book
books	this is a wonderful book that catches the subtle and yet glaring clashes of outlook on country and escape , grounded firmly in love and faithfulness . it moves quickly ; i was afraid of a tragedy at the end but the resolution is quietly reassuring and poignant . the grounding love is as much sexual as otherwise but that 's understandable in view of the widely different backgrounds of julie and abu . and it is not transient but deepens . miriam , abu 's sister , remains with me in her moving quietude , and the litle girl lela , hand in hand with julie , plucks deep
books	received qickly and in great condition
books	lately there has been a lot of talk about how great ronald reagan was as a president . this book shows that this is not even close to being true . under his presidency we went from the number one loaner to the number one debtor in the world . him and his administration sold missles to iran inexchange for hostages and then illegally took that money to support contras in latin america . under his administrations hands off approach wall street ran wild with illegal and immoral practices . all this happened while his administration held down the poor and middle-class while giving the rich more money . it is debated whether reagan knew some of these things were happening hence the title of the book . it is a very good read and easy to fly through the whole book . the only complaint about it is the lack of an indept description of the savings and loan scandle and the dredded star wars program . recommended for anyone intrested in learning what happened behind the scenes of this presidency
books	everything that i 've made so far has been really really good . recipes are easy to follow and pack up nicely for next day lunches
books	i 'm a zone diet believer - but this book is a serious letdown . two major problems with this worthless book : 1 . almost all of the recipes involve *far* too much preparation - the title is *very* misleading . 2 . i find it hard to believe that anyone actually prepared these recipes , and thought they were *good* ! most of the meals are horrible due to the *huge* proportion of vegetables . i mean , an omelet with over 3 cups of asparagus ? ?
books	what do you do when the world is coming to an end right before your very eyes , but no one seems to believe you ? that is the concept facing dr. thomas more , distant relation to the famous/infamous saint thomas more , in walker percy 's novel `` love in the ruins '' . the united states is at a time of crisis , but few seem to understand the implications of the events unfolding around them . it is up to dr. more , who knows how to diagnose the problem , but not necessarily treat it , to try to prevent the chaos from happening . the story begins on a hot fourth of july , with doc staking out the abandoned howard johnsons motel in town . in three separate rooms he has cocooned his three paramours and he is waiting for an event that he knows is going to happen ; an event that could very possibly bring about the end of the world . the novel then shifts back in time to the three previous days , tracing doc 's journey that led him to seek refuge at the motel . the reader learns that he has created a ontological lapsometer , a sort of `` stethoscope of the human spirit '' , through which he can diagnose exactly what ails a person 's soul , and finally discovers how to treat it . meanwhile , there is a revolution brewing ; the bantus and love children are ready to take over what the white man has destroyed , if a major catastrophe does n't befall everyone before that can happen . `` love in the ruins '' is a truly southern novel , crafted through percy 's intelligence and tempered with the same absurdity that is a trademark of great southern writers such as percy and flannery o'connor . the reader must suspend disbelief as to the events unfolding , even though they are frighteningly realistic , and not so far-fetched in this present day . percy 's hero doc more is an antihero on par with those of hemingway ; flawed , prone to drink , forever chasing after women who are wrong for him . this novel is his coming-of-age , in a sense , because doc learns what it is he wants out of life , and how to best achieve that . subtitled `` the adventures of a bad catholic at a time near the end of the world '' , `` love in the ruins '' is a deliciously funny and poignant look at a near-apocalyptic america
books	im not sure where to begin with this review , its not that the book was poorly written , quite the opposite it was a very good piece but it lacked any sort of luster or appeal . it was quite infact extremely boring , by page 300 i could not wait for it to be over and this is weird because up to this point i have loved the gunslinger series , they were all very good from front to back . there is way , way , to much about susanah and the whole thing about her having this baby and it dragged and draged , maybe this series is showing its age im not sure but one thing is for sure it was no wastelands or wizzard and glass . it was a far fetch from those titles and it had barely any excitement . it got to the point where i had to try very hard to pay attention and often i would find i had read a page and not remebered what it was about and had to read it again . im giving this book 2 out of 5 , very poor story line , poor plot however it was written well i can only hope that the next book is better , cmon king give me the feeling wastelands did , blown away ! ! rather than tired and exhausted
books	tony nourmand 's `` film posters of the 60 's '' is a wonderful and colorful coffee table style book that is a great treat to look through . there are many of the classic film poster images of the french new wave , the films of stanley kubrick and the classic 007 posters , just to name a few . film poster collecting is a great adventure and this book reflects that enthusiasm . this book was lovingly organized with great detail . a superb value ! looking forward to future editions
books	i only needed this for school a little while back . now i am marketing in hawaii at a resort and realizing this book taught me little to nothing . have fun with it if you please though
books	i requested this book for my college music class . i saw many offers from b and other book stores and i found amazon having the best price and received the book on time . the book was in great condition and my fellow students were surprised when they heard the price and the shipping response . i totally recommend this site and book for school . the book was comprehensible and well illustrated .
books	i purchased this book based on the mostly glowing reviews from other reviewers and i am very disappointed . the arabic fonts used are so small that , at times , it is actually quite difficult to make out the letters . definitely , not a book for people who are new to the language
books	this book , `` the relatives came '' by cynthia rylant and illustrated by stephen gammell , was a delight to read . i found myself smiling as i read the words that made the artwork come alive . likewise , i found myself recollecting over the memories of the past when my relatives would come to visit . and , i felt as if i , too , were a part of this book . having experienced growing up in a small town where you don`t see that many people , i believe that when relatives come to visit , it almost seems like christmas . as a result , when the book expressed the joy , laughter , and celebration of family , it stirred up these memories of the past . unquestionably , almost anyone , from children to adults , could find themselves reminiscing and longing for the fun they had when their relatives come to visit .
books	`` tourists are learning that the image of the terrible turk is false , created to a great degree by it unfriendly neighbors . turks are quick to remind visitors that , surrounded by syria , iraq , iran , armenia , georgia , bulgaria , and greece , they 're not living in mr. rogers ' neighborhood . '' this is a direct quote . it sounds like they 're trying to say that the surrounding countries are painting an incorrect negative image of turkey . which is amusing , since he listed both greece and armenia there , which were both targeted by turkey . either this writing staff has no idea what they 're writing and is just happy to sell books , thinking no one will double check the info , or they 're racist and opinionated . either way , i would n't trust the info in here even as a rough guide on where to go .
books	patriotic terrorist fighting storyline . exposes the political games played in washington , that many times put our military in dangerous situations . this book inspires me to patriotism and also deep gratitude to the special forces men who are so brave . i know the book is fiction , but i ca n't help but feel that it is more truth than fiction . mitch rapp 's wife anna is getting a little hard to stomach . she is a good example of how an aggressive woman can nearly neuter a strong man . again , hard to recommend to absolutely everyone because of the explicit sexual situations . i hate to encourage my teenage boys to read it , although 95 % is absolutely wonderful and inspiring , portraying men as real men .
books	brooke dojny 's new england cookbook : 350 recipes from town and country , land and sea , hearth and home , is a stunning achievement , a magnum opus of a cookbook . published by the harvard common press , the book chronicles the cookery of new england from maine to connecticut , from the first thanksgiving to the present . dojny 's approach to the region goes well beyond new england standbys like clam chowder ( although she offers three tempting recipes ) and spans practically all the food traditions of all the ethnic groups who ever called new england home . the eight baked bean recipes in the book include one for cuban black beans and yellow rice and another for west indian peas 'n rice . new england cookery has embraced food from all over the world -- besides caribbean , you 'll find culinary influences of native american , english , portuguese , italian , irish , german scandinavian , greek , french and hungarian cooks -- and all are represented in this book . yet , for all its broadness of scope , this is a very personal book ; dojny 's voice can be heard throughout , in the headnotes , sidebars and essays that describe the people and places associated with the recipes . the book is also a wealth of new england food history and lore , as well as tips on cooking techniques and ingredients . bravo ! ( excerpted from the culinary connection , the newsletter of the connecticut women 's culinary alliance
books	i have only read the swedish translation of what i suppose is the `` old edition '' , but judging by `` look inside this book '' , this new english-language edition incorporates much material from the old . incidentally , the swedish edition gives the authors name as kallistos ware , apparently his taken orthodox name , while timothy ware is his original , given name . in sweden , the swedish translation of `` the orthodox church '' is the only readily available book on the history of the orthodox church . apparently , its used informally as a textbook in some college classes on church history . it also contains chapters on theology and worship . in my opinion , the book is a necessary introduction for those interested in orthodox church history . its first chapters summarize the history of this church during the byzantine empire , under islam , and in russia both before and during communism . of particular interest is the authors interpretation of the catholic-orthodox split , usually dated to 1054 . the author believes that the so-called fourth crusade in 1204 was the real and final consummation of this split . however , the book must also be read with some reservations . the author is , after all , an orthodox christian himself . its safe to assume that there is a certain bias here and there . for instance , ware denies that the byzantine church was caesaropapist , a very untenable suggestion . at other times , he is surprisingly `` liberal '' for an orthodox . for instance , he paints mehmet fatih , the muslim conqueror of constantinople , as a very tolerant ruler . i also wonder about his interpretation of the church father cyprian . even so , `` the orthodox church '' remains an indepensable book for those looking for a short and concise historical over-view of this remarkable christian church .
books	surely there 's more to chinese youth culture than descriptions of affairs with tall western men . being a fan of pearl buck 's books on china , i was looking for more contemporary accounts of chinese culture . but this book was so dissapointing.a `` goodlooking '' shangaiese woman gives vacuous details of her affair with a tall german man . while her doped impotent chinese boyfriend simple wastes away ( why was he even in the story ? ) the writing is totaly lacking in any kind of talent . `` i was willing to assume her glow was due to her romance than her shiseido face cream ... '' . need i say more ? if you want to read an account of a totally self absorbed woman infatuted with caucasian men , indulging in meaningless affairs , which probably boosts her self esteem , read this . but there 's nothing worthy about china or chinese culture in this .
books	i am absolutely furious about this book . i quit reading about half-way through . i read it through the section about it 's a wonderful life ( chapter 13 ) . in that chapter , i found three mistakes - not minor details , but major , provable points , including misquoting zuzu and misquoting the inscription in the book in the last scene - within four paragraphs . if eliot 's work is that shoddy in four paragraphs , how can i trust the rest of the information in the book ? avoid this at all costs ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
books	another hyprocritical nut . these christian fundamentalists like are literally screaming jesus , while cutting your throats , not unlike the jihadi fundamentalists . the only thing is they cant do that now as they used to couple of hundred years back by enslaving and lynching blacks , killing native americans , and showing their christian love for the jews- by exterminating them . hope our future generations dont have to live in a christian saudi arabia . this is what these whackos envision
books	if you liked whyte 's previous sophomoric efforts , you 'll love this . in addition to being the same dumb , hackneyed story lines and stock characters we are used to from the previous books , this one has the additional feeling of being pure filler : in no real way does the story get advanced . arthur begins as a baby , and ends as a small boy . there are adventures , but nothing important happens . as usual , in whyte 's books , the bad guys are left alive so they can sneak up and do new evil , and as usual the bad guys are pure plot devices and in no way characters . with all the ( totally ahistorical ) democratic rhetoric , merlin 's brother shows up out of nowhere and they immediately hand him half the power in camelot . anyone who would read this , i guess , has already read the previous lame offerings in this series and does n't object to laughably boring plots which rely heavily on coincidence , caricatures who never grow or change , and historical detail that sounds like it comes from a museum brochure rather than any real scholarship . so go for it . but please , if you want something exciting that will also make you think , look at the really good arthurian efforts out there -- gillian brandshaw , a.a. attanasio , or barbara taylor bradford to name just a very few..
books	i just recently discovered an interest in philosophical thought , and i found myself overwhelmed by all the resources available to me . i had no idea where to start when i stumbled across the philosophy gym . nothing could have been more appropriate . it dives right into all the hot topics and gave me some foundational knowledge about how to approach those issues from a logical standpoint . it introduces the reader to basic philosophical terminology as well as several of the great historical philosophers and their famous arguments . each topic is brilliantly presented in nice bite-sized chunks with suggestions for further reading at the end of each chapter . i could n't be more pleased with this intro to philosophy
books	some photographers think what 's erotic is what 's hidden and left to the imagination . two thirds of the pictures in this book are fig leafed with shadows or clothing , leaving plenty to the imagination . think of playboy magazine in the 1950 's or vogue or madamoselle magazine today . many of these are stylistic , but not very erotic . one in three of the photos in the book are erotic , not afraid of nudity . do n't make the investment in this book if you want high level eroticism . instead get `` shaven angels '' , `` natural beauties '' , `` 100 naked girls '' , or `` crazy , sexy girls '' .
books	i 'm a big koontz fan and as is generally the case , i greatly enjoyed this story . it was a little strange but that 's to be expected from this author and genre . that said , it starts off fairly quickly and flows well through most of the book . it had the curious sense of near-division in that the book almost seemed to be separated into two distinct sections that were not , in my opionion , as well-connected as in many of koontz 's other books . in addition , the ending seemed a little hasty . thus i gave it four rather than five stars . that said , i would gladly recommend it to a friend as i would most any of this author 's work
books	the journal format is a unique take on the genre and i especially like the detailed attention given to gear and survival . the author obviously knows his stuff . what 's also impressive is that this novel is self published . i 'm surprised someone has n't taken notice and offered j.l . bourne a deal . he 's good
books	i also bought the hype of nytimes best seller . goes to show you some people have really bad taste . the story was promising and could have been exciting without the awful dialog . it seems like the author was being paid by the word - too much repetition , entire scenes which added nothing to the story , etc . i would never purchase another book by this author . glad it 's over and this ones in the trash can ... charli
books	clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist crap fail to see it for exactly what is ; an endorsement of ethnic cleansing . if the tables were turned and a jew , or a muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with judaism , or islam was brutally murdered than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. i do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage , or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of hateful filth ! !
books	this is basically a commercial pitch for dr. murad 's spas and products . unless you are planning on buying his regime , he gives very , very scant information about how you could accomplish the program using other , less expensive products . do n't expect an easy how-to giving you day by day advice of supplements and skin care . it 's not here . i decided to buy this based on other 's good reviews . now i 'm thinking that they were written by employees . i was very disappointed
books	this is one of the worst-written programming books i have seen yet . i 'm sorry i bought it . it appears to be written by a man who knows quite a bit about finance , and dangerously little about c++ programming . duffy 's review correctly describes the main flaws . i would add that ( 1 ) the book is not structured to build upon oo , gof patterns , or stl design principles ; ( 2 ) the code does not follow even basic c++ coding conventions ; ( 3 ) the images ( screenshots ) are agonizingly unreadable ; ( 4 ) the code listings are in italics using a variable-pitch font [ is courier font code listing so difficult to include in a $ 100 book ? ? ? ] ; ( 5 ) no over-arching component object model is suggested anywhere in the book . some of the efforts at brevity are just plain wrong or even dangerously wrong to teach beginning programmers . for example , pg 19 data types section : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- int - holds integer numbers up to a little over 2 million , for example , `` int i = 2000000 ; . '' long - same as int . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- wrong , professor ! this is not only a syntactically incorrect example , but a just plain wrong assertion . if the reader does not know how to determine the ( platform-specific ) size of an `` int '' or `` long '' , then the author has only served to confuse the matter further ! furthermore , i consider it a `` cheapskate '' tactic to ask readers to pay for the code from this book in electronic form ( particularly when the book 's code listings are so sloppy ) . that said , i would not use the code , even if it had been supplied for free ... but it *might* have been interesting to have something to play around with ... have any of the reviewers actually used any code from this book without substantial refactoring ? the only use i could see for this book is for intermediate-advanced fin-techs , who want to review a few general algorithms for selected derivative calculations ( futures , forwards , etc ) ... but just be prepared to squint and suffer through reading the code
books	i have never been a fan of danielle steel 's books and have only read a couple in my lifetime , and those many years ago . i 'm not sure what motivated me to pick up toxic bachelors -- extreme boredom ? insanity ? -- but i slogged through it last night and have to say that it confirmed all my bad impressions of this writer 's work . actually , i think i was a little surprised by how awesomely bad it was . the writing was completely repetitive and superficial , and i rather felt that i was reading a treatment for a novel rather than the novel itself . it read like a poor book report : `` ... and then he did this , and then he did this , and after that he did this , and then he laughed . '' we are told that the bachelors -- who struck me as commitment-phobic , a little neurotic , and fairly immature despite their ( middle ) age , but not necessarily toxic -- are decent , likable guys , but we never really see too much proof of that . when the `` proof '' does come , it 's so ham-handed as to be laughable : charlie 's eyes well up with tears when he meets a young girl who was abused by her mother , and so we know that he truly does have a loving and compassionate soul and untold complexities to his character . yeahsurerightwhatever . most of the story is told through narration , with little bits and pieces of ho-hum dialogue . the author adopted a third-person point of view , but there 's certainly nothing omniscient about it , and the reader is never sucked into the head of one of these characters . throughout the book they remain about as interesting and dimensional as paper dolls , and their interactions with one another always struck me as being fairly unbelievable . this is how men behave and relate to one another ? i find that hard to believe , considering that none of the men i know run around telling each other how much they love one another and how important they are to each other . i liked the female characters of the book initially . they all seemed to be strong , capable , independent and emotionally healthy women . but my opinion of each diminished greatly toward the end of the book , as each woman seemed all too willing to disregard her personal boundaries and put up with extreme schmuckiness from her man . and the conflicts steel generated amongst the couples seemed ridiculous : mountains out of molehills . for instance , gray , the 50-year-old artist who has always been phobic about family , refuses to meet the adult children of the woman he 's been with for several months and whom he claims to love . nevermind the fact that he 's known about the adult children since the very beginning . nevermind the fact that the adult children live in england and italy , while gray and sylvia are new yorkers . nevermind the fact that they have their own lives and are independent , self-sufficient adults who maintain their relationship with their mother through frequent phone calls and less frequent face-to-face visits . evidently gray ca n't see beyond the fact that they are `` kids '' and therefore `` family '' and therefore not to be tolerated . sorry , but whatever sympathy i 'd developed for gray by this point disappeared altogether when confronted by this monstrous display of immaturity . dump the weenie , sylvia . you can do better . the other two guys had similar displays of gross ridiculousness , and of course everything was wrapped up magically , with sudden capitulation , as if the men had just suddenly come to their senses . considering what little time and effort was spent on these characters , their conflicts and resolution , i have to wonder why steel even bothered writing this book . and why i bothered reading i
books	a very good , very quick military history overview - hits all the main points without belaboring any , gives the reader a good list of authors to look at after finishing howard
books	in all the talk about education issues these days , it 's easy to forget that what 's really important is the relationship , the energy , between students and teacher . when the teacher closes his door and is face-to-face with thirty kids -- that 's where it 's at . it 's not test scores or textbooks or innovative curriculum -- it 's what happens between people in a classroom . this book shows that dynamic relationship between eager , active kids and a caring , active teacher . it 's not all pleasant , and successes are sometimes small , but a pervasive caring underlies it all . as a teacher , this book reminded me that sometimes the best thing i can do for my kids is to leave all that paperwork , go for a walk , go to bed early so i can be there for them the next day
books	as a librarian and a lover of all things relating to arts crafts style , i recommend this book to anyone desiring a greater knowledge of this furniture 's history and design evolution . with clear color photographs and just the right amount of text , this book illustrates the origins of arts crafts furniture in england and its progression , first to our east coast , and eventually westward across america . in fact , my only 'complaint ' about this book is that the photographs are good enough that they leave you wanting for more . because of the depth of information presented here , i would not say that this is a general interest read - rather this book is geared toward those seriously interested in the history of the arts crafts movement and its recent revival .
books	i seem to be in the minority , but i did not enjoy this book at all . the main character is , of course , the `` only female to ever survive becoming a werewolf '' but this was only the start of her amazing speshulness . i felt the plot got swallowed up by the author 's need to self-insert and 'play ' in her world , and the only reason i finished this book was that i was on a plane and had nothing else to do . the plot fishtails several times , and is n't all that interesting to start with . in short , i was left with a bad taste in my mouth concerning the author in general , and will likely skip her books in the future
books	i would like to know what kind of a wuss needs to use a stradegy guide for a first person shooter ! ? i mean , they 're pretty straightfoward - walk forward and kill all the bad guys you see ! how hard is that ! ? halo is an awesome game but it 's really not hard to figure out what to do ! i mean you 'd have to be a complete moron not to know what to do or where to go . it tells you more than once what to do during the game - you got that extrememly annoying cortana yacking in your ear pretty much non-stop , tellin ' ya what to do . but anyway i 'm done ranting at you wusses
books	one good knight ( 2006 ) is the second fantasy novel in the tales of the five hundred kingdoms series , following the fairy godmother . in the previous volume , alexander and elena organized resistance to the invasion of fleurberg by a dark magician . after the death of the katschei , alexander and elena were wedded , becoming godmother and consort . then an order of champions was established at glass mountain , with alexander as their master , and elena was given charge of fleurberg in addition to her other kingdoms . in this novel , princess andromeda of acadia is nineteen years old , but is still considered a child by her mother , queen cassiopeia , and chief advisor solon adacritus . she writes a report on the merchants for a trade conference and impresses both the queen and the chief advisor . after that , her mother orders redecoration of the princess wing , appoints two ladies to design her wardrobe and jewelry , and assigns a steward to handle her affairs . andromeda is quite overwhelmed by this attention and augments her studies to further impress her mother . she notices that income from wrecked ships has grown due to an increase in the number and severity of storms . her studies and inquiries suggest that this increase is probably due to the manipulations of a great wizard . she reports this matter to her mother . afterward , andromeda is resting high up in a tree within the palace garden when she notices a strange flying creature . as it comes toward her , she recognizes that it is a dragon . then it reaches the palace and she observes that it is a very large dragon . it flames some high architectural features , grabs a couple of animals and flies away . the panic within the palace is phenomenal and the subsequent meeting of the queen 's advisors is very lively . andromeda has quickly reviewed the literature on dragons -- consisting mainly of myths and legends -- and reports to the advisors that the only known method of managing a dragon is the sacrifice of virginal maidens . the ensuing discussion is even livelier , mostly concerning the means of choosing such sacrifices . queen cassiopeia states that the only fair way to select sacrifices is by a lottery . after the spate of crazy volunteers dies down , a lottery is organized . some women find ways to disqualify themselves , but others are taken by the dragon . rumors begin spreading that anyone who speaks out against the queen is more likely to have a family member selected for the sacrifice . but then andromeda is selected . this novel is mostly about the influence of the tradition within the five hundred kingdoms . andromeda 's knowledge of the tradition comes in handy at various points in this quest . the queen has sent to glass mountain for a champion to fight the dragon , but the good knight does n't come forward as expected . someone has erected a magical barrier at the border to keep out such warriors . however , andromeda is sort of saved by a champion at the sacrificial site . andromeda convinces the knight to take her along as a guide and finally proves to the champion that she can be a help rather than a hindrance . they travel cross-country in the same direction that the dragon had flown , stopping for supplies here and there , and finally enter the wyrding lands . they encounter unicorns and a fox along the way before meeting the dragon and his brother . then andromeda learns that all is not as it seems . andromeda is nineteen and naive . then she is faced with one of the most difficult of issues : does her mother love her . while many events occur in this plot , this one issue is the crux of the story . even her interspecies romance with the younger dragon is only a temporary relief from this main concern . highly recommended for lackey fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of adventure , betrayal and romance . -arthur w. jordi
books	i respect the message of `` the unexpected legacy of divorce '' but it seems rather odd to call the ramifications of divorce `` unexpected . '' those of us who have been through the hell of divorce know full well the problems our children face as a result . staying together for the children is one of the most damaging concepts of all times . the author knows this and does present it in a way that eases my frustration a little bit . i know many people who have divorced and not one was due to not being ecstatically happy all the time . they fell apart due to abuse , infidelity , and just plain incompatibility . what i feel matters most for children is for them to feel loved and cared for by their parents . when you have two parents who both love and share in the lives of the kids , most hardly notice whether or not they live in the same house . when you have a parent who refuses to makes the children a priority , who constantly disappoints , hurts , and replaces the kids , there will be damage , no getting away from it . however , is it better for this type of parent to have daily access to the kids , seemingly with the other parent 's approval ? i hardly think so and will challenge anyone who differs in opinion . it is impossible for any of the children of divorce to know if their lives would have been better had their parents stayed married . this is a major flaw in the research . i did n't see any statistics for custody or parental involvement which makes a huge difference . i do n't think divorce is the answer for every marital problem but when it happens , you have a responsibility to make your children a priority and alleviate their fears . when you put your own personal interests ahead of the kid 's , whether it 's divorce or starting a new life afterward , kids will suffer . i do n't like 'studies ' like this , they 're misleading and potentially damaging .
books	americans who ca n't name five poets will name allen ginsberg . in this case , that is good since he was one of america 's greatest poets . this book attest to this . i write this review to show disappointment in the publisher who continues to publish the collected works on the cheapest paper next to newsprint . for the next edition , i would like to see , at least in limited edition , a volume printed on quality paper which could last more than a few years before turning yellow . ginsbergs deserves better treatment
books	i picked up the audio book from the library , and did n't know by the title and author 's name ( my first jance book ) that this was chick lit . i do n't feel this book was something i would 've started had i known . it started real well , and ms. jance knows how to reel you in with her writing . midway it got off track for me when the the protagonist started blogging about her unfair release as a new anchor , and then about her friend who died of als , and then came the long responses to the blogs . it just got sickening to this reader and made it hard to stay with what could 've been a decent suspense drama .
books	having attended the fictitious `` grove school '' bingham describes in this book , i am confident in saying that it is all true . we are all indeed messed up and destined for the ivy league . in any event , the fictitious `` fairfield academy '' does also exist . i frequent the grove house of pizza and i highly recommend the chicken cutlet sub . bingham has written a fine text and i only wish he were alive to read these reviews now . hip hip hooray
books	playstation and x-box have nothing over the toy of the future : a time-travel device which allows for visits to the past . there 's only one problem with theo 's enjoyment of the latest model : it appears to be defective , and his interactions with peoples of the past increasingly holds dangers of changing the future . the debut titles in the newe `` jump-man rule '' series by james valentine , do n't touch anything provides quick action and unpredictable twists of plot , including romance , making it a most unusual , satisfying adventure story recommended for ages 8-12 .
books	beautiful , stunning absolutely gorgeous . a quick note to fellow brits , this was ordered on october 22nd and arrived on november 1st and is much cheaper here than on amazon.co.uk or anywhere else in the uk ! ! i 've ordered stuff domestically that has taken longer in the post ! !
books	good basic book , bringing back points i had been taught , and a few new to me . price most reasonable .
books	when i found `` hour game '' in paperback at our local library 's monthly book sale , i thought i had hit pay dirt . but i can not believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as `` the winner '' and `` absolute power '' could turn out such a dog . long , boring , and confusing . i fear that mr. baldacci hired an `` aspiring young writer '' to `` help '' him crank out a quick book . i can not pass this book along to my friends -- i could n't do that to them . it will be tossed into our blue recycle bin . what a waste . what a shame .
books	this book opens our eyes . sure , we feel that we know what we should be doing . many times we are right in our hunches . yet , we still do not always do what needs to be done . instead , out of either laziness or taking the easy road , we fail because it is so easy to do so . besides , the customer will always walk in the door . right ? as this book reminds us , the customer may never be back . it is in the insight of a professioanl like tasca that we are reminded of wehat we may already know . again , our implementation of these rules which he explains simply , we will achieve . another book i encourage is `` cars and people : how to put the two together . ''
books	this book contains reproducible mini-books , bingo cards , flash cards , some word search puzzles and fill-in activities . in my opinion , the fill-ins are a bit too challenging . i even had trouble with them . the only thing in this book really `` worth it '' that i could n't make as well myself , are the mini-books . the mini-books each contain several different sight words , so they seem to me to be more effective for review of words the student has already learned than in the initial learning of them
books	i thought this book would be great and was really looking forward to making some of the recipes , but i have to admit i 'm disappointed with the recipes and with what i 've baked from it so far . i was surprised that so many of the recipes called for vegetable shortening instead of or in addition to butter . i know the book itself explains that shortening is used to achieve a certain texture , but i have read in other baking books that shortening is a crutch and does n't deliver the flavor punch of pure butter . so i was a little skeptical , and then reading through the recipes , although they are very clearly written , there are n't a lot of extra tips on technique or anything for individual recipes . the book already assumes a level of competence . i made three recipes from the book : the essential chewy sugar cookie , the essential chewy chocolate chip cookie , and the fudgy brownies . all three recipes tasted delicious , so i ca n't complain there , but the brownies came out a little tough for my tastes , and both the cookies spread too much -- way too much , and i even refrigerated the dough for the sugar cookies . i consider myself to be an intermediate baker and have made these cookies from other recipes in the past with better results , so right now i 'm wondering if i should even try any more of the recipes in this book or just give up . i think it 's okay for a `` base '' cookie recipe book , but you would need to look elsewhere for better techniques or to tweak the ingredients
books	renowned artist and tarot scholar/writer robert m. place has produced a masterpiece in his new tarot 384 page companion book , the buddha tarot companion : a mandala of cards . this book affords a rich unique perspective of the tarot through the lens of the buddhist paradigm . the companion deck comes in a beautifully illustrated box containing exquisitely designed cards that fit perfectly in my hand , a tiny black gossamer bag plus a bordered little white box with the instructions , `` embellish this box with protective and/or empowering symbols . '' other suggestions that greet you as you begin your journey with the buddha cards include : `` smudge with sage to cleanse and re-energize the cards after a reading . '' and `` store your deck with stones or crystals that absorb negative energy , promote healing , or provide protective energy . '' also included in the box is a mini-book with guidelines on reading these particular cards . both items are published by llewellyn , who as always , have taken great care to ensure quality and aesthetics in the way the cards are packaged and presented . robert has done an amazing job in correlating the life of the buddha with the tarot journey through the cards . he describes how the major arcana fits perfectly with the life of siddhartha and his journey of enlightenment . each of the tarot trumps is a stage on the mystic 's journey to enlightenment . in fact , it is mr. place 's belief that the creators of the tarot were directly influenced by the life of the buddha , and incorporated archetypes into the major arcana based on his journey . he teaches that the ancient wisdoms were not isolated from one another . instead , `` the classical world maintained communications with india and the ancient western philosophers were familar with indian philosophies . '' as well , the islamic world introduced the christians to the life of the buddha during the middle ages . `` the european christians were enamored with the story , and they transformed him into a christian saint - st . josaphat . '' i was fascinated by the titles given to the major arcana cards . each of the 23 cards reflect an important aspect of the siddhartha 's personal journey to become the enlightened one , the buddha . robert place has created a deck and book that not only meets the needs of people who practice eastern beliefs . he also acts as a mediator to help people of the western world learn about and appreciate the noble tenets of buddhism and its teachings for life . i highly recommend this deck - i found it very easy to follow , the graphics are amazingly detailed and artistically rendered and the companion book clearly helps you to learn to `` read '' using a buddhist world view .
books	is the main goal of every male evo-psy writer to attack feminism ? here 's an experiment for you : juxtapose the ideas in this book and , say , pinker 's blank slate with those of , i do n't know , any two female evo-psi writers and watch the incongruities jump off the pages . it 's f % ing comical . but guess what ? the females ' books are way better thought out and accurate while the males ' are a lot of wishful thinking . hmmm ... .aging , successful man writes that lovely young lasses and aging , successful males are made for each other . that men are wired to treat sexually liberated women like s @ % , and to fawn over repressed , chastity obsessed airheads . whatever
books	crudely written . a negative hero deserves better and wharton has written some fine books . sadly , not this one .
books	if you love ludlum 's over-the-top novels ( and i do ) , the matarese circle has to be up there with the best . not all of ludlum 's books are a good match of plot and style -- the repeated `` oh my god ! '' declamations of one character after another can get silly when the goings-on are n't as riveting as they could be ( the two bourne sequels suffer from this problem , i think . ) but circle delivers on all fronts . part one is a masterpiece all by itself -- the intricate cat-and-mouse game between talienkov and scofield plays out thrillingly . and these are two of ludlum 's most believably drawn characters ; we feel empathy for both , and root for them to join forces from the get-go . antonia gravet , the inevitable gorgeous heroine/love interest who surfaces in part two , brings a well-crafted and believable backstory to the plot . one final bonus : some of ludlum 's zestiest minor characters appear in this book , adding to the fun in nearly every chapter .
books	the author really just could not hook me . a lot about food but not sure what else
books	the author has her narrator ( `` cinnamon '' ) spend most of her time comparing herself to the fascinating scarlett , in a game of wish-fulfillment one-upmanship . even though she 's calling the shots , as it 's her book , scarlett still comes out miles ahead . perhaps it was only that way for a certain strata of society , but there was once a beautiful world of chivalry and gallantry and bravery and even some idealism-even if misplaced-just as there has been throughout the ages in other societies , such as `` ivanhoe '' presents.the story may have been one-sided , but it 's the side mm chose to tell , and there 's kernel of truth in the `` myth '' of the old south , as in all myths . margaret mitchell has nothing to fear from this silly so-called `` parody '' , which is really a subconscious-or not so subconscious , in fact-effort to knock from her pedestal , that epitome of heroines-katie scarlett o'hara and the wonderful melanie wilkes.as if rhett would ever give any other woman a serious thought-he was obsessed with scarlett.that 's why he turned to women like belle watling.and to imagine mammy killing the male babies , when she had been devoted to ellen o'hara from ellen 's childhood.thank goodness this book is n't a pimple on the fanny of the classic gwtw , because what it is a a travesty-and not even a well-written or engaging one at that.gwtw will still be read and loved for all time , like the classic it is , when this book is selling for a quarter at garage sales.i did n't even pay that , thank goodness-the woman gave it to me , and i read it and burned it with the rest of the trash.i 'd give it a negative star if there was such a rating.ludicrous and laughable-try again , ms randall , and try to get over the jealousy of scarlett and co. again , margaret mitchell need not fear , lol
books	i love mysteries set in ww ii and like old time radio so i could n't wait to begin this one . the `` hero '' is a junior varsity tom joad but , ok , i was game . the cast of characters that seemed to number in the low 80s and be interchangable `` baddies '' and `` goodies '' . they were hard to keep track of without a scorecard but there is no quit in this reader and i pushed on . then when we got to the jersey shore , i found out that in 1942 with america fighting for it 's life against fascism , and losing , our hero knew why . all the servicemen were bullies ( a drafted station employee ) or morons ( the coast guard beach patrol ) . the 4f `` hero '' was the real mccoy however . although not actually mentioned i bet he wished that dratted ear injury had n't kept him from joining the abraham lincoln brigade . he was moderate enought to think marxism had some problems ; the murder of 10s of millions of ukrainians and the nazi-ussr pact probably and i say probably , did n't elude our observant literary genius . he was also a 1975 era feminist ; all those plucky ww ii women throwing off the handcuffs chaining them naked to the kitchen sink had his unhesitating support . most big businessmen , probably wearing spats and silk high hats , were the bad guys needless to say . i wondered how someone could write such a truly awful book . i could n't finish it and it 's a point of honor for me to finish all books . then in the bio it all became clear . the author was a flack for former congresswoman pat schroeder of colorado . i 'm still haunted by her rictus grin and constipated , quaker schoolmarm expression that said `` somebody , somewhere is having fun and i want it to stop now ! ! ! '' anyone who could stand to work for pat could write this book with ease
books	seventeen-year-old catherine morland has always been preoccupied with three very important things : dancing , dressing , and reading sensational novels . but doing these things wo n't get you a husband , or acquaint you with other young ladies , such as yourself . so , upon request from a neighbor , catherine is invited to spend some time in bath - a fashionable town , where catherine will have the opportunity to interact with people of her own age and stature , who are not related to her . and that is where the naive catherine meets up with the thorpe family . quickly becoming friends with isabella thorpe , catherine begins spending much of her time with the illustrious , yet conniving family . and it is only when catherine is rescued by henry tilney , along with his charming sister , eleanor , and whisked off to their ancestral home , known only as northanger abbey . there , catherine 's choice of reading material - mysteries and ghost stories , that is - comes back to haunt her ; for northanger abbey is victim to terrible noises in the night - such as creaking , and frightening winds , that leave catherine feeling as if she is residing in a haunted place herself . the fact that the enormous house is filled with various locked doors , and a curious history only heightens young catherine 's suspicions , and makes her question what mystery and secrets are lurking within northanger abbey , and the tilney family , in general . jane austen has been a favorite of mine since i was very young , but it was not until this past weekend that i happened upon northanger abbey while browsing through the bookstore , and decided to purchase it . i will admit that , hands down , this has become one of my favorite austen books . catherine is an enchanting character , whose innocence , and naivete make her charming from beginning to end ; while her overactive imagination leaves the reader chuckling in delight at the many crazy notions she creates within that bright head of hers . catherine 's interactions with isabella thorpe , and the rest of the thorpe family are intrepid , and truly make you feel strong emotion towards those particular characters ; while the charming henry tilney - like mr. darcy - makes you root for a romance to blossom between our dashing businessman , and our young heroine . a wonderful , satirical piece of fiction , that should certainly be discovered by anyone who calls themselves an austen fan . erika sorocco book review columnist for the community bugle newspape
books	there are many gorgeous photos of both the insides and outsides of public and personal spaces . i was actually surprised at the number of homes we get a peek into . if you enjoy interior design , of just about any style , you will find it here . i love all the personal libraries shown , crammed with books and interesting objects . loved the mannequins , esp the life-sized guy sitting on the couch . i am a fan of exotic , eclectic decorating and found many examples to keep me happy with the book
books	amazing how a writer can attempt to make an immoral organization , the corporation , look moral . only someone like al capone could sympathize with this group on the oregon . how can anyone justify having the sort of firepower as is on the oregon . the us apparently is willing to finance the group , but the us also financed sadam , noriega , ... unfortunately , in this sense it is too much like real american policy , which absolutely disgusts me ( the ends justify the ends no matter how many bodies are left behind , as long as they are not righteous americans ) . the characters are clichï¿½ , there is no suspense since everything goes as planned , and anyone in the crew can just about do anything , including being a successful rock band . it makes me look back on the dirk pitt books and wonder about dirk 's morality
books	i have yet to use an actual phrase from this guide , but ... it is good for re-charging my batteries when i have to write a review and feel uninspired . after reading through some ideas in this guide , i usually find i can then find my own words to say what i need to convey . the fact that all the phrases are positive , i see as a good thing because i feel it 's important to have a positive attitude toward the associate you 're reviewing . if there are challenges in the persons performance , the manager should have been working with the associate on that throughout the review period . i would recommend this book but only as a way to inspire the person writing a review to come up with their own way of phrasing ... rather than use the phrases in the book . the people we manage deserve more than `` copy/paste '' reviews .
books	i enjoyed the parts regarding the s.s. valiant , but the later part of the book simply did n't work for me . except for picard , who we of course know quite well from the series , the other characters were flat and uninteresting . we never find out what is motivating the alien attackers and they are the cardboard cutout enemy-of-the-week , boring . the whole `` adversarial '' situation with the 1st officer also just struck me as odd and wrong , and was just not developed correctly or fleshed out beyond being another cardboard enemy for picard
books	painstakingly compiled by judy brown ( contributing writer and comedy critic for la weekley ) , the funny pages is an impressive and hilarious collection of 1,473 jokes gathered from the funniest modern-day comedians around , ranging from robin williams to bill cosby , george burns , conan o'brien , and many , many more . the individual jokes are arranged by topic underneath dictionary-style headings . from alcohol to yoga and zoos ; each gag is short but sweet , and packs a punch in this chuckle-inducing , highly recommended anthology of wit , gags , and humor both classic and cutting edge
books	when i found out francis collins has written a book about his faith , i ordered it the same day . after all , we seemed to be following the same path . i earned a phd in molecular biology in 1981 and had several `firsts ' in the area of gene cloning . then i found christ as a 40-year-old . my transition was from a semi-serious jew to a materialist to a serious christian . hearing about dr. collins ' spiritual walk had me intrigued . his book should be entitled `` a politician presents evidence for belief '' . it is a completely uncritical view of the last twenty years of biological research . the human genome project is elevated to status of `` bridge to a momentous new era '' . hogwash . hype is the term i would use . the dept . of energy was duped into footing the bill because the national institutes of health saw it as a waste of resources . the author could n't make a better case for the payoff than to show humans have more `junk dna ' than previously thought . dr. collins then explained darwinian gradualism as if it were dogma . this oversimplification is typical of those who never studied biology except at a medical school . this is not entirely his fault , however , since many scientific journals will not publish research where evolution is n't perfectly gradual and perfectly random . their motivation should be perfectly obvious , but it 's not even on dr. collins ' radar . he also uses mendel 's peas as a pivotal point in our understanding of genetics , assuming the reader would be ignorant that mendel 's data was `dry-labbed ' . usually an author who writes on this subject is strong in either biology or theology . dr. collins relies on two sources for his treatise on theology : st. augustine and c.s . lewis . i happen to agree with him that the creation story and the books of job and song of solomon have a `` lyrical and allegorical flavor '' . i would include the book of jonah in that category as well . however , there is an entire literature on the subject that is completely overlooked . the only time dr. collins makes a strong case for anything , it is to refute edward o wilson , richard dawkins , and their minions . even then , he uses a quote from the late stephen jay gould for his most scathing criticism . francis collins is the consummate politician -- he takes a stand without offending anyone . dr. collins knows that jesus was not a politician , and he did not worry about offending the intellectual elites of his time . take this quote from mat 23:14 `` woe unto you , scribes and pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye devour widows ' houses , and for a pretence make long prayer : therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation . '' dr. collins ' book claims to be a middle ground for theists and scientists . in my opinion it is a piece of fluff and a narcissistic retelling of the human genome project myth .
books	i tried , i really did , but i could n't get beyond 100 pages . i love iris johansen books but it seemed she had no joy in writing this one , almost as if she were forced to do so . it contained none of her usual style . the dialogue was choppy and boring and nothing made you care about the characters . i 'm still a fan and hope the next book is written in more typical ij style .
books	this is an enlightening , meticulous story of william `` boss '' tweed and , as past of the context , his three key cronies in the ring : peter sweeny , richard connolly and oakley hall . it is a story about how the new york times elevated itself by getting the goods on corruption and bravely exposing it on the front page . oh how the mighty have fallen ! the time of power ( terror ? ) for tweed 's edition of tammany hall was relatively short , but tammany hall power lingered well after tweed 's demise , another eithy-five years . the critical moment to the story is when tweed engineers the proverbial license to steal by devising a new charter for new york city , putting the power in the hands of his incredibly greedy ring of thieves . the four took this opportunity to carve out a fortune for themselves , primarily by paying millions of dollars for a courthouse that should have cost a few hundred thousand to build . a disgruntled 'whistleblower ' ( the term had no meaning back then ) copied over the records in enough detail to demonstrate the bold theft and fraud . there are several versions of how the blockbuster story of the padded expenses and outright theft came into the times ' hands , but the remarkable part of the story is just how brazen the `` ring '' could be , how convinced they were of their own invincibility or ability to bribe , cheat and steal their way out of any legal investigation or hearings . people who today believe we live in an era of unbridled corporate greed and ethical lapses need to read this book to better understand how much the supposed watchdog and people 's friend -- the government -- can be part of the problem and a barrier to the solution . the cast of characters , sinners , ( few ) saints , and masses of immigrants makes following the flow of the book sometimes a challenging task . thomas nast , a pivotal character if not the hero of the book , provides some vivid , visual signposts . nast not only draws a compelling picture for often illiterate 'readers ' , he was one of the first to put a face on public figures who heretofore had not been subjected to portraits or paparazzi as are today 's politicians . nast 's giving tweed a face may have been one of the breakthrough aspects of this story . it certainly helped catch tweed when he jumped bail . a few maps , perhaps some old drawings , and even a list of key characters could have perhaps clarified some of the story or reduced my thumbing back to previous pages or checking the index for the entry and bio of important members of the cast . there are some historic new york times front page stories that help create atmosphere and context . any reasonably educated american should have learned at least the sketchy details of tweed 's nefarious deeds and nast 's colorful cartoons . ackerman does an excellent job of documenting and detailing , filling in the gaps , and bringing now faded , black-and-white characters back to life
books	after devouring this book , i immediately passed it to a client who is developing a speaking business . lenny 's book is full of real-life examples and practical tips for communicating clearly and powerfully . whether you want to speak professionally or just communicate better in your day-to-day life , this is the book for you
books	i looked through this book at a craft store the other day , and as a person who loves the ocean and seashells , i found maybe one project in here that i would consider making . just about every project uses a ridiculous amount of shells so imagine the cost would be prohibitive and for this reason projects look overly ornate . unless that is the look you are seeking to accomplish , i would n't recommend this book . try to find `` decorating with seashells '' by anita louise cran
books	`` the number '' poses an interesting question but provides no helpful answers . a four percent draw on invested assets is as much an old wives ' tale as a piece of scientific wisdom , even if it is a number . eisenberg 's number is the inverse of that draw down , or twenty-five times ... . well , there 's the rub , twenty-five times what ? income ? expenses ? income less savings ? projected discretionary spending ? post-mortgage payoff and college tuition expenses ? the proverbial bottom line is clouded by conversations with an eclectic collection of consultants , experts , philosophers , and casual acquaintances . eisenberg , a former esquire editor and short-timer with lands end , ruminates about a simple question : how much money do you need to feel secure ? the problem is that security comes in multiple forms : happiness , comfort , excess consumption , ego . and the accuracy and stability of those measures and outcomes is compounded by key assumptions about how long you will live and how healthy those years will be . constructing a one-year budget is hard enough . constructing a thirty-year budget is nearly impossible . eisenberg does n't help his case by the offbeat and idiosyncratic examples and profiles he chooses . doctors , divorcees , `downshifters ' , and very little real data shed little light on the real issues . maybe i knew too much going in . maybe i expected too much from a few positive references from other sources . in the middle i was confused . by the end i was simply disappointed . and i have my own number , and it changes every day
books	herf applies a very simplistic test to determine the nazification of both germanies : did they side with israel in the middle east version of the cold war or did they not ? the trial against paul merker in the east , which had as its background east germany 's reluctance to pay reparations to expropriated jews , serves as his prime evidence for the continuation of things nazi in the gdr . but both of these arguments completely ignore the marxist ideology underlieing the rationale of the east german leadership and bypass more complicated issues of political allegiance . moreover , they totally eclipse the east german cultural discourse on the holocaust , a discourse that was decades ahead of discussions in the west and still proves to be more sophisticated than most that is being written in western academia .
books	this is the worst novel that i have ever read by a major author . i have read a couple other alex cross novels and i did not find them to be awful at all . they were n't very good but they kept me turning the page . while i was reading this dreck i began to get a sense of patterson 's work ethic . he sets a goal for himself and does not stray from it . one maybe two chapters per day i suppose , and when his muse is on vacation for a couple of months this is the result . not a snowball 's chance in hell that this would have been published if it were n't written by patterson . i 'm done . do n't waste your time . really
books	published in 1986 , dr. deming `` out of the crisis '' seems to form the basis for the transformation needed in american management mentality . two main subjects are discussed in the book . the first is the exposure of problems and pitfalls in top management operations , the second , relates suggestions and solutions that can solve and transform the way american management operates . 14 core points are suggested by dr. deming to address problems in management and are supported by many examples using different scientific methods . throughout the book , dr. deming promotes the loss of slogans that are even today being practiced by a share of the american industry , and advocates management that is based on principles such as quality and leadership . at times , the book is not a continuous process that is easy to follow , but overall , dr. deming 's concepts are transferred to the reader . dr. deming 's `` out of the crisis '' helped me learn new perspectives about how management and employees can help in building or transforming an industry to a successful one .
books	i really feel stupid about ordering this book . why did i do it ? . the story is that stacey is moving back to new york
books	spend big bucks and hire the boston consulting group to help you with your strategy . . . and what do you get ? hardball answers that question indirectly through sharing classic strategies for achieving competitive and economic advantage employed by bcg clients . as a result , i think this book will be most appealing to mbas thinking about working for bcg and potential clients who want to get a sense of what the outcome might be like . for those who are well read in business strategy , this book will be a disappointment . it focuses on very little you have n't read or thought about many times before . skip this book if you are in this category . the strategies discussed include overwhelming competitors with superior resources ( frito-lay versus eagle snacks ) , adjusting to take advantage of what customers want more of ( more variety and better delivery from wausau papers ) , threatening competitors ' sources of profits ( japanese auto makers go after the big 3 's positions in minivans and suvs in north america ) , copy and improve on better business models ( batesville casket applies automotive manufacturing techniques ) , encourage your competitor to retreat ( attack the bottom of the market first in low margin categories and move up ) , refocus your business model on one set of advantages ( carmax ) , acquire others to build your strengths while making competitors more vulnerable ( masonite international ) , and change the nature of competition ( get to low-cost sourcing earlier than competitors , secure low-cost assets sooner and play the wal-mart card carefully ) . the overall metaphor for the book has its problems . if you play to win , you are playing hardball . al dunlap ( author of mean business ) was a hardball guy , but it did n't pay off at sunbeam . if i read past the words in the book , the concept they authors are advancing is one of being unrelenting in developing a strategy that creates a virtuous cycle of ever-expanding resources and advantages while creating a vicious cycle for competitors of ever-decreasing resources and advantages . `` keep 'em down '' would have been a more accurate title for the book . you will find scant information in the book about newer types of strategies , new forms of technology and new business paradigms . this book is about `` rock 'em , sock 'em '' competition among the industrial giants of the world . i worked as a consultant and later as a project manager at bcg in the early 1970s , and i was struck that the kinds of strategies and clients described here have changed almost not at all since then . i do think hardball better captures the classic bcg approach used in the early 1970s than any other book i have read published by the firm or its professional staff . bruce henderson would be proud of you ! from my perspective , i graded the book down for slight inaccuracies in places such as underplaying the legal risks in these strategies ( the authors seem to think scaring off competitors with `` signaling '' is pretty risk-free ) , misstating some of the cases ( did gm really crush ford 's ability to get investment grade bonds by pushing for zero percent financing ? -- it looks more like mutual suicide to me ) , and praising more than was due in some cases ( the japanese car companies were very late to come into north america with minivans and suvs ) . i also thought the metaphor got in the way of the message . . . rather than enhancing it .

books	as a casual piano player and a broadway fanatic , i was so jazzed to play some of the songs from avenue q . the book contains everything you find on the cd and includes a few production photos . of course the little details are fun , using terms like `` manilowesque '' `` huey-lewis shuffle '' `` prissy sonata '' and `` funky a** groove '' to describe some of the songs . fun fun fu
books	though the concept of sharing real life problems experienced during pregnancy is a great one , the author is extremely biased toward hospital birth managed by obs . at one point , the author actually defends episiotomies ... she seems to blindly accept every procedure her physician pushes upon her , and she looks at him as being responcible for the outcome of her birth . it was both infuriating and saddening . if you are looking for a book to make you laugh a little , this is cute . if you are looking for a book that might actually aid or assist you in making informed choices concerning your pregnancy or birth , this is not for you !
books	a 600+ pages tour of flash mx buttons and menus ... with just a couple ridiculously elementary `` tutorials '' thrown in . makes me think of somone who had to write a flash book and has never done anything with it but figure out how the user interface works . you wo n't find anything useful in here , that is about creating something with flash . as for me i am never gon na buy a book from this author again , and i am probably also ditching the whole `` savvy '' line as well .
books	man , oh man , i think this is one of the worst books i 've ever read . if i could give the thanatos syndrome negative stars , i would ! seriously , half way through , i came to amazon to see how bad other people thought it was . boy was i shocked to see that almost all of these reviews were positive ! i found the book bizarre , unfocused and poorly written . the volcabulary repeatedly seems misused . the plot is not reasonable given the safeguards that us funding agencies have in place with regards to human experimentation . the physics , engineering , psychology , medical chemistry and biology are uninformed and unrealistic . characters are introduced as though they will be important to the outcome , only to have them dissipate . and so on . the characters do n't even seem like real people . for example , the main character recognizes his cousin by seeing her ankles - and only her ankles - flashing below a curtain , and yet he is apparently unaware of what degree of cousins they are . how could someone know a person that well , but still only have a vague idea of how they were related by blood ? or : one of the more reliable male characters blows duck hunting calls at women he finds attractive - as though he really thinks this will attract them . c'mon , if the guys a nut ( and anyone who tries to seduce women by talking 'duck ' to them is nuts ! ) , write him as a nut the whole way through , do n't make him the cornerstone of reliability at the book 's climax ! the book 's title is n't even explained , for crying out loud . thanatos means death in greek , i believe , but i could never understand what the author/editors/audience thought was dying . i wo n't read this one again , nor will i look for anything else by percy walker .
books	the stationery is cute and colorful , but the pages are very cluttered . while the envelopes have spaces to write addresses and put return labels , the pages are too colorful and bold . a ballpoint or ink pen does n't look good on the paper .
books	wonderful text . helps to rationalize and boost understanding on why cubans living in miami have such foreign behaviors in the eyes of the outsider . the author takes you by the hand , and walks you step by step . absolutely wonderful and did an excellent job at steering clear of any bias
books	great book ... .my partners therapist recommended it for him to read it helps you to understand deal with the problems easy to read understand
books	was not impressed . narrow scoped , personal reflections , applications limited . i also read the male companion book wild at heart and was also not impressed
books	unlike most dystopian novels , which tend to focus on what may happen to government in the future , `` a clockwork orange '' focuses on the nature of the individual in the future . our protagonist is alex , only 15 years old but already a habitual criminal , roving the streets with his band of friends , taking advantage of every opportunity to wreak havoc on the world around him . the boys have no qualms about attacking the helpless . in fact , the more helpless the victim , it seems , the more pleasure the boys take in the act . the most interesting and disturbing aspect is that the boys manage to maintain a strange sort of innocence even as they commit the most heinous and violent crimes . they are n't doing any of this out of malice toward their targets ; in fact , it seems to matter very little who they pick as a victim . they are creating mayhem just because it 's fun for them . everything changes , however , when one particular break-in goes horribly awry and alex finds himself sentenced to 14 years in prison for murder . there , though he manages to create an illusion of good behavior , we see that the experience has no real impression on his sense of morality . then , after two years , he is chosen for a new , experimental rehabilitation program , designed to rid him of any desire to indulge in , or even contemplate , any acts of violence . as we see , however , this `` treatment '' also leaves him without any choice in the matter of being good or not . he has to be good because he is programmed to be . this , of course , raises the question central to the book : does good behavior actually mean you are a good person if you have no freedom of choice ? the book can be a little difficult to get in to at first , predominantly because of burgess 's unique style . the story is narrated by alex and thus , is written in the complex slang language , invented by burgess for this book , that the youth of this society engage in . for example , a sentence taken from the opening chapter : `` he looked a malenky bit poogly when he viddied the four of us like that '' ( pg . 5 ) . there is no glossary , but if you stick with it , you will start to develop a feel for what most of the words mean after a couple chapters . however , if you find yourself having difficulty , a nice , comprehensive lexicon can be found on wikipedia if you search for `` english to nadsat '' ( due to review guidelines i am not allowed to include a direct link ) . unfortunately , it is alphabetized by the english equivalents , not by the slang terms , so looking up a word can be a little difficult . one final note of interest : the original british publication of `` a clockwork orange '' had 21 chapters , as does the current american edition . however , when the book was first published in the united states , the last chapter was dropped . as burgess explains in his introduction to the restored version , publishers considered this 21st chapter a sellout . whether it is or is n't is up to you to decide , but i can tell you that the presence or absence of the last chapter makes a huge difference in the overall feel and message of the book . without the final part of the story in place , the book offers a bleak message , implying that human nature can not really change . on the other hand , reading the book with the final chapter in place gives us a little more hope . beyond that , burgess tells us in his introduction , interpretation is up to you
books	wow ! i read all these great reviews and thought this would be a great book . luckily , i got it out of the library did n't buy it . i liked it at first , but then the situations got more more implausible . then i was reading it just to laugh at it . some of the sentences in the book were completely ridiculous too . if i had the book here at work with me , maybe i could quote a couple descriptions that just had me rolling my eyes . not a well written book at all in my humble opinion . glad the rest of you enjoyed it anyway
books	i enjoy reading books of trivia and fun facts , but i did n't even make it through the first chapter before i put this book down in disgust . almost every entry had to do with sex or male endowments . as i was flipping through the book , i found x-rated pictures and drawings that i would hate to have to explain to my children if they were to pick up this book . i never would have bought this book if i had seen it in a bookstore , and i regret throwing it in the trash before i could see if i could get my money back
books	i purchased the book with the intention of teaching myself all the core material in it . the material offers readers a limited number of examples per chapter per section . while these examples may sometimes make you wish for added detail , ultimately there is enough explanation to pull the reader through . be sure you understand the previous chapter before moving onto the next or you will most likely get lost . in the end i was very satisfied with my order . listen to me ... if your at least decent in math you 'll do just fine following this algebra 2 textbook
books	if you are interested in a very traditional approach from a professional photographer , this book will provide lots of information . it also provides valuable tips about controlling the dog . but for my taste , i found the photographic results to be uninspiring - too much posing , too much portraiture lighting , not enough of just plain capturing that wonderful dog as it is
books	this book is important for every one who has a back `` issue '' . given 5 as gifts to loved one 's experiencing back pain
books	rolling stone has long been the `` gold standard '' for rock journalism . any history of rock and roll that does n't have billy joel or bob seger is all right by me . i need to update my copy right away ! great job , as usual , rolling stone ! ! ! !
books	i 'd never read berry before , but as far as i can tell , this brief collection of six essays and lectures sticks to familiar territory . however , it 's probably not the best entry point for people who are newcomers to his realm . there are two related problems with the book : one of presentation , and one of tone . the problem with presentation is that the pieces are so short that there 's no room for specifics . so , while one might be more or less in accord with the broad strokes of berry 's vision , there 's no detail to back it all up . the problem with tone is that from the very first page the reader feels like they are being lectured at . of course , some of the pieces are lectures , but there 's a certain condescension that runs throughout the book . it comes out when berry uses certain words such as the three as of `` appropriate '' , `` authentic '' and `` adequate '' . when these are used ( as they often are ) , there he 's obviously made some kind of value judgment , but the reader is never let in on it . the end result of the two flaws is that the reader feels like a hectoring argument is being made without any supporting logic -- which ultimately smacks of preaching to the choir . which is unfortunate , since i tend to agree with berry on a lot of things ( though not his anti-abortion stance ) . small farms are good , agribusiness is bad , stewardship of the land is good , extraction industries are bad , treating the body as an organic whole is good , and things of that nature . alas , he has a tendency of making sweeping assertions and accusations that are far too simplistic and shrill to be useful . two examples from the first 15 pages will suffice to illustrate : `` this is a world in which the cultures that preserve nature and rural life will simply be disallowed . '' and `` communists and capitalists are alike in their contempt for country people , country life , and country places . '' berry also succumbs to the trick of creating straw men to counter his theses . for example , in one essay , he claims that conservationists are people who want to simply preserve land in a pristine , untouched state , and that 's all . while there are certainly some conservationists who feel that way , they are a small minority of a a much larger community who actually is in almost total accord with berry 's views on stewardship and land use . it certainly does n't help matters that his view of small-scale farming appears to be heavily tinted with rose-colored glasses . his claims that modern agribusinesses has rendered the small farm economically unviable sounds like a reasonable proposition . however , it ignores the fact that , historically , small scale farming ran on the thinnest of margins , was subject to all kind of external instability ( weather , vermin , etc . ) , and operated on only slightly better than a subsistence level . in farming , cash is scarce , that 's why people abandoned it in droves whenever the opportunity presented itself , such as in wwii , when all those defense-industry factories were opened in california . ( of course , in berry 's vision , you do n't really need cash , because you barter for everything you need from your neighbors . ) berry 's exhortations to create small-scale communities is worthy stuff , and even in cities people are creating this . the growth of csas , farmers markets , and the like in the past decade is a tangible indicator of this . however , to achieve the large scale results berry seeks requires a more rigorous roadmap than what is provided in this slim collection
books	this book was amazing ! i 'm giving it to my dad for helping me through college ! great gift for parents and children !
books	i have read this book daily for almost 20 years . the original book , given to me in 1979 is somewhat worn and now i require a replacement . it has been and will remain my first reading each day
books	dr. temperance brennan , a forensic anthropologist , is called upon to aid in the investigation of a commercial jet crash in the mountains of north carolina . andrew ryan , a colleague and romantic possible , turns up on site also when his partner in the quebec police is listed on the flight manifest . when temperance discovers a foot that does not seem to come from the disaster site , things begin to get dangerous for her and those around her . it becomes a clue in a deadly mystery involving many highly placed individuals who want their secret to remain just that , a secret . temperance and ryan spark reactions from each other , the question is , will it ignite or just smolder ? ? this novel is full of forensic science and detail that open the door to a fascinating yet gruesome world . kathy reichs has an afterword page in which she talks about 9/11 and the real disaster site in nyc where she aided in determining the identities of victims from the twin towers , serving on the government disaster response team , much like temperance in this novel ... ... .although she says the horror and emotional impact was more than she could have imagined . the novel was written and published 2 months before the real disaster occurred
books	these are true tales from a clinical neurologist 's notebook , but this is n't just any neurologist . oliver sacks , author of the justly celebrated , the man who mistook his wife for a hat ( 1986 ) and awakenings ( 1973 ) , which was later made into a movie starring robert deniro and robin williams , and other works , is a gifted writer with a fine sense of story and an even finer sense of humanity . he has a style that is both affecting and fascinating , yet studiously objective , a style laced with footnotes and clinical observations , historical comparisons and wisdom . part of the power of these tales , and of all of sacks 's work , is his ability to be totally engaged and to identify with the subject while part of him is off to the side observing with scientific impartiality . this makes for a compelling read . if you 've never read sacks before , you are in for a very special treat . these tales are paradoxical because `` defects , disorders , diseases '' can bring out `` latent powers , developments , evolutions , forms of life , that might never be seen or even be imaginable , in their absence . '' it is this `` 'creative ' potential , that forms the central theme of this book '' ( from sacks 's preface , page xvi ) . the first tale , `` the case of the colorblind painter '' is about a successful artist who worked in color all his life only to became colorblind at age sixty-five , and the effect this had on his life and work . the second , `` the last hippie '' is about an amnesiac man with a frontal lobe tumor that left him stranded in the sixties . sacks tells this sad , pathetic story with vivid detail , and characteristically ends it with a footnote , a footnote of such warmth and genuine identification that we are moved to tears . ( do n't skip the footnotes ! ) the third tale , `` a surgeon 's life , '' is an amazing account of a canadian surgeon with tourette 's syndrome . it is here that we begin to see the central theme of this book in brilliant illumination . dr. carl bennett , riddled with the bizarre tics characteristic of the disorder , compulsions that cause him to throw things , to touch things again and again in a ritualistic manner , to flail , jump and jerk about , nonetheless became a very successful ( and beloved ) doctor of surgery . sacks scrubs up with dr. bennett and goes into surgery with him , during which , miraculously , the tics disappear for however long it takes to complete the surgery . sacks visits him at home and meets his wife and two children , sees the dents in the refrigerator and on the walls , and comes away with a sense of how astounding the human potential to overcome adversity can be . the fourth tale , `` to see and not see , '' is about partially restored sight and how it was not a blessing . this sad story illustrates how sight is learned from infancy and is largely a constructive and interpretive function of the brain . this tale also lets us see how the world of the sightless can be rich and fulfilling beyond our imagination . in the fifth tale , `` the landscape of his dreams , we meet a gifted artist , franco magnani , who from memory alone recreates his home town of pontito , italy through his paintings . he has a nearly photographic , three-dimensional memory , but because of a strange illness that befell him when he was thirty-one , he cares only to re-create his pontito , not the people or events , but the houses , the masonry , the stones , and he does so continually with microscopic and affecting detail . the chapter `` prodigies , '' focuses on an autistic artist , stephen wiltshire , whom sacks is determined to befriend and understand . in this tale , and the concluding tale , `` an anthropologist on mars , '' sacks helps us to penetrate the world of the autistic and see it ( at least in my interpretation ) as an alternate view of reality , a view with its own strengths and weaknesses , a world that is just as true and valid as the `` normal '' one . of course severe autism is debilitating in the extreme , and even modest autism can permanently scar and alienate the autistic from society . yet , perhaps that is society 's loss . i even got the sense , in reading these concluding stories about autism , that perhaps theirs is an evolutionary `` strategy '' trying to emerge , that is , a different way of seeing and dealing with the world that also might work . i would not be shocked to discover some day that the autistic , with their sometimes extraordinary gifts of memory and concentration , are melded more completely and seamlessly into our usual consciousness , and that humankind is the better for it . incidentally , the last tale about temple grandin , who is a professor of animal studies at colorado state university , is remarkable because it is about an autistic who is completely integrated into the society , yet remains autistic . she is the one who says she sometimes feels , because of her different perspective , like `` an anthropologist on mars '' when she views `` normal '' people . sacks allows us to see why . bottom line : this is an extraordinary book of insight and scholarship about the human condition , written with grace and a deep sense of humanity , not to be missed
books	if you adore the intellect and see in it the only way to the highest , purest , and most divine knowledge , than this is your book -- but it is n't mine . page after page of speculation about the higher realms open only to a mind freed from the crude considerations of the flesh ... .i kept hoping that plotinus would realize his vision and disappear before finishing , but it did n't happen
books	the characters are uninteresting and 2-dimensional , the dialog hackneyed . i have no idea why it 's on the new york times bestseller list . it was more of an obligation for me to finish this book than anything else . do n't waste your money
books	this book does cover alot of information not needed for clep , but it does give you a great guideline on who and what to study for clep and good examples on what questions will look like for the actual clep . i wanted to ensure i was prepared for the clep , so i purchased this book and disregarded the other 2 comments . although , they were right about the obscurity , this book still taught me alot . you do n't necessarily need it , but if you want to be prepared , this book will not hurt your bank account that much . i also recommend the complete itiots guide to american literature ( 5 stars , check out the reviews ) , and the internet . that is all you need
books	the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy is the number one best selling book in the galaxy for many reasons . one it is slightly cheaper than others , but most important is that it has the words'do n't panic ' written in bold letters on the cover . the story of the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy revolves around this remarkable book . this story strangely begins when the earth is destroyed by a vogon construction fleet clearing the way for a hyper space express way . the last earthman , arthur dent , is saved by his best friend ford prefect , who is actually an alien that comed from a small palnet somewhere in the vecinity of betelgeuse . they are soon thrown out of an air lack and rescued by the heart of gold using the infinate improbability drive . inside they meet up with zaphod beeblebrox , the two headed , three armed president of the galaxy , trillian , an earthwoman who arthur failed to pick up and wnt with zaphod , and marvin , a parinoid android . this book tells of there amazing adventures throughought the galaxy . these adventures involve mice , an abandonded planet , a rather suprised sperm whale , and the number 42 . i loved this book for many reasons . one reason is that it is filled with unexpected humor . another is that it gives a good spin on life . i could always count on this book to cheer me up . do n't just stop with this book there are many others in this series .
books	this is one of nora roberts ' best books ever ! i have read everything she 's written and this is now my all time favorite . i adore this book . the characters are interesting and very human , the plot is gripping and the background fascinating . callie , an archeologist , comes to a little town in maryland to set up a dig and ends up learning about her birth parents and reuniting with her ex-husband . what i really like about this is the two main characters already have a history before this book so its so much that they fall in love on the spur of the moment , like most romances ( including roberts ) . definitely a book i highly recommend for both the romance and the thrilling plot . it will keep you glued to the pages until you figure out who the bad guys are
books	first , the story takes place in the 1940s ( harold 's brother is mia in wwii , not in vietnam , as the amazon.com review erroneously states ) . second , the writing is superb . mr. lawrence makes you feel emotions without telling you what to feel . his characters are very real . his setting ( a small , struggling circus , traveling the western u.s. ) is historically believable , peopled with 'freaks ' who suffer as sideshows , unable to find any other way to live because of the bodies they were born with , but peopled also with 'normals ' who are either afraid of or cruel to the freaks . harold , the 14-year-old albino central character , tries to straddle both groups of people . he finds his niche in the circus as an elephant trainer . i am admittedly ignorant about such things , but mr. lawrence again makes the storyline with the elephants -- crucial to the plot of the novel -- seem believable . my only complaint about this otherwise very moving book has to do with the writing at a crucial death scene near the end . i do want you to read this book , so i will try not to give anything away here , but the writing at this important point becomes formulaic in the dying character 's last words and even gomer pyle-like ( people actuallly say `` gosh ! '' ) . this did detract from the impact of the death , unfortunately , but i still very strongly recommend this book . five stars for a book with a major flaw says a lot !
books	tom friedman 's writing style is easy to read and his overarching concepts-webs and walls ; states v. markets v. individuals ; and the comprehensive failure of the arab street , leadership and muslim clergy to combat the really tough and valid questions of the day-are extremely well thought-out . from reading this compilation of nyt columns , i understand where friedman conceived many of his ideas for his current best-selling book , 'the world is flat . ' although i sometimes disagree with his opinions , his ability to see the big picture is spot on
books	what a great book . i have been turned off to religion due to the negativeness that surrounds it . watching joel osteen on tv and reading this book makes me love god even more . when i think back on my life , i have truly had many blessings and i no longer need to feel guilty for accepting god 's blessings . god has always been about love , hope , faith and greatness . he has never been about hatred , prejudice or guilt .
books	the color tabs really help you know what section to look at . the only disadvantages of this field guide are that it does n't document every species in north america and that the new national geographic field guide to the birds of north america , fifth edition has the blue grouse split into the sooty and dusky grouse making it more up to date ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! still , this field guide has many good things .
books	this is a tough review to write because i felt the authors made a good effort in the writing of the book and explanations of the spring framework . writing a book is no small feat , and technical books are a special beast . with that last statement in mind , this is were the book sadly falls short . for one , the source code available online is a significant rewrite of the books ' code . the authors explain ( on the publisher site ) that this is because they learned better ways and techniques to implement the samlpe application after the book went to print . while improvement is always good , this presents two problems . 1 . the sample application is now out of sync with the material . not a good thing for those trying to learn , as you require more effort to study in tandem with the book . also , and this is not to disparage the authors skill , but i buy books because i am expecting experienced , if not expert advice . if a small , sample application needs rewriting , perhaps they should write about something else ? further down this road , the sample application has errors that prevent it from compiling . i suspect that the final build file was not tested , or it was a case of `` well , it compiles on my machine '' . there were several dependencies that required changes to the build file so it could be compiled . thankfully , i use eclipse and imported the project . eclipse immediately informed me of missing dependencies , which i resolved by getting those jars on the build path and in the build file so they would be deployed in the war archive . examples are : jakarta-commons/collections , and several core spring jars relating to dao and database access . for an experienced developer , familiar with ant and a good ide , it was not a lot of trouble to get it running , it just did not give me a good impression . bonus info for anyone switching the database out to postgresql : first , no matter what db you swap in , you 'll need to change a few hard coded references in the build file . i made property variables which i placed in build.properties . then you will need to change the class user to something else ( and of course anything in the app that references it . ) . another great reason to use eclipse . why you must change it , is user is a reserved keyword in postgresql and you will get databases errors because you ca n't name a table user
books	other reviewers have taken pains to outline the `` plot '' of this baby boomer bodice ripper . suffice it to say author kathryn harrison , scrupulously adhering to some private conviction that `` more is better '' , offers estrangement between identical twins , loss of a child , incest , paternity confusion , mid-life crisis and spiteful erotomania as it crops up in the life of one understandably confused new york shrink . this reader was aching for the hero , will , to book himself onto jerry springer while feeling immensely shortchanged by lines from ms harrison like `` it 's just ... it 's ... what is it ? will does n't have a word for what he feels . '' ( perhaps the character lacks the emotional vocabulary to communicate with the reader : the author , however , should not . in any case , those are lousy , lazy sentences among so many examples . ) in addition to being insufferably , cartoonishly silly , the book is wounded by a dreary internal structure . bad things happen to will-the-shrink , will then regurgitates them at length to his shrink , then buttonholes his wife to regurgitate what happened , what he thinks happened , and what he thinks about what his shrink thinks . as for ms harrsion 's `` famous '' sex scenes . they practically lie on their backs , fondling their adverbs and panting for penthouse approval : `` she 's unbelievably wet and tight and impossibly , almost unnaturally , slippery . '' `` envy '' , by the way , is ms harrison 's 11th book and she should , by now , be getting things more right than wrong
books	i love danielle steel ! i`ve read all of her books so far.but secrets was a big disappointment to me.as far as i am concerned , ms.steel tried to change her style of writing in this book more to the kind of judith krantz or jackie collins ( some explicit `` parts '' i didn`t like at all ) .simply not the danielle steel we like . the story itselfs is ok ( gives the readers some `` insights '' behind the scenes of hollywood ) but ... . some of her books i`ve read over and over again . i am not going to touch secrets for a second time , however
books	do you feel different from people around you ? do they resent your ingenuity ? have you been kept from achieving your full potential by tradition-bound brutes who live only for base needs ? do you long for the company of others like yourself , who , tragically but inevitably , are biologically destined to wipe these shorter , darker subhumans from the face of the earth ? congratulations ! you are either in the aryan nations or the clan of the cave bear fan club , possibly both ! ( i exaggerate- you could be a nineteenth century english settler in australia , or a boer in south africa , or maybe you just like larry niven , but that 's beside the point ) i can forgive auel for the historical inaccuracies in the book . in the late 1970 's when she did her research , we did n't have the genomic tools to reconstruct the lives of neanderthals , and even now enough controversy persists to keep the discussion page lively over at wikipedia . ultimately we 'll never know for sure what the paleolithic was like , and auel 's is if nothing else a vivacious fictional suggestion . similarly , her bloated , almost puffy writing style is excusable in a first-time author , though one wonders what parasite infected her editor . i have n't read her more recent works , but i imagine she has probably improved . even with the pendulous sentences clan is not unreadable . what infuriates me is the casually racist subtext of the story , nowhere critiqued or even acknowledged . the story reads like a near-literal historicization of helena blavatsky 's secret doctrine on the fall of the `` aryans '' - who interbred with `` subhumans '' introducing the world to , oh i dunno , domination by the unworthy , blind tradition , suppression of the individual , all the hallmarks of the book 's neanderthal culture . of course , even in this the blond-haired blue-eyed ayla is innocent , overpowered by a brutish thug . against this master narrative , all the admittedly interesting side notes about plant-based medicine and flintknapping make no impression . i would recommend anyone interested in paleontology take a trip to a museum or cruise the internet , and give auel 's books a wide berth . also ? enough rape scenes already
books	although a majority of readers obviously loves this book , i have to say that it really seemed like a waste of money to me . our only daughter left for college this year , but fortunately i have trained her in time to be independent . if your kid does n't have a clue how to live in the real world and if if you 're still willing to do everything for them and not have them take responsibilities for their own lives , this book is right for you . not in my dreams would i have made lists for her what to take because she can well do this herself ! i do miss her and she misses us but that does not mean clinging dependency ! i expected different things from this book , on a deeper psychological level
books	ironweed by william j. kennedy was the latest selection for a book club i 've recently joined . the premise of the club is to read a novel and then view the movie ( at the group meeting ) that was based on the novel . as i expected , the movie paled in comparison to the book , despite the screenplay being written by kennedy himself . jack nicholson plays the main character ( francis ) and meryl streep is his `` wan na be '' socialite girlfriend ( helen ) , but this star power does n't elevate the story beyond what kennedy had already done in the novel . set during the `` great depression , '' ironweed is a great look at the underbelly of society : drunks , homeless , impoverished , and in that regard the story is timeless . i enjoyed the characters ' quirkiness and the loosely connected plots , but more significantly to me were the themes of redemption , forgiveness , and love . the love aspect may be hard to spot , but it is there , unconventionally , in many of the character 's interactions . this favorable recommendation comes with a warning : it can be a depressing read , definitely not a happy one , and while i found it inspirational , it will not conjure any blithe emotions . ironweed is definitely not a june beach read , being more apropos to a long winter night , indoor , by a warm fire .
books	the emotionally unavailable man should be added to everyone 's self-help library . ms. henry clearly identifies and defines the problem , then prescribles manageable steps for healing . her energetic writing style involves the reader right from the start . even those who do not suffer from emotional detachment will find this book engaging . most may even identify loved ones who either exhibit this or who are involved with someone who exhibits this behavior . clearly this is a book for our times .
books	i did n't see the other reviews until after my copy arrived . having now wasted a weekend reading this book , i have to agree with everyone . the topic sounds great , the book is n't
books	i really love to get these for my wife , surprises are best when i give them to her , and she enjoys all of them from this great author , but she and i were not happy when i thought i found another of this super special portal series : - ( . having a new cover is nice but its a new publisher with nothing more than marketing in their minds , really hated to say this but we all know her books are super great , just know this is a reprint before you guy and like others , get a little ticked its not new after you fork over the cash and get your hopes up ! peace everyone : - ) jeff
books	first book i 've read from sandra brown and it was really great . it was a page turner from beginning to end . i found the book interesting and easy reading . a well written mystery suspense that keeps you guessing until the very end . will not be the last sandra brown novel for me
books	this year , 60 % of college entries will be female . look at this spring 's honor role listings . last year , 78 % of honor role members in my community were female . schools are fails boys - not girls . if you wish to waste your time on a politically correct diatribe that is full of anecdotal and subjective pap , then get this book . if you want to really improve the quality of education , there are thousands of reads better than this
books	this book is the same as `` teach yourself origami '' and `` origami , the art of paper-folding '' , just with another cover to make you think it is new , also in the webside they describe it as a book of david brill , it does not contain nothing of him , not even his name mention ! ? ! ? if you have no origami book , it could be good for you , other wise beware ! !
books	i am reading this for a college course called `` history of the american city '' . this book is a typical 'college texbook ' in that it is filled with numbers , dates , percentages , figures , numbers , oh did i say numbers , dates , figures , and years , oh and plenty of numbers ... the brilliant , dilligent , honored , and esteemed scolar of a woman that wrote it sure knows her numbers , facts , years , etc ... i , on the other hand , am absolutley hating it and foolishly i have allowed the drop date to pass , so i have to read the book or fail the class . i am getting nothing from the book regarding any kind of understanding of any of these cities , unless i am willing to spend years interpreting the multitude of data the book heaps upon me . needless to say , from ( attempting ) reading it i am getting a headache and do n't really even have the time to write this review . i say that if even one person is deterred from reading this expose ' of numbers , names , dates , figures , facts , percentages , orders , years , dates and more numbers , dates , facts , figures ( are you getting my drift yet ? ) , it will be time well served though. -- - avoid -- - this -- - book . please -- find another book . maybe if people told the truth about this brand of writing , more professors might have to teach and people like ms. abu-lughod would n't continue to make money off of writing books such as this , and folks like her might have to write to communicate ! ! ! ! , like the rest of us.thank you for taking the time to read this . ok , i have to say it : this sucks .
books	this book , up to the very end was very good . with out a doubt a three star book maybe three and a half . the end is what ruins the entire thing . do n't worry i 'm not going to spoil anything . i 'll just say the ending stinks out loud ! this story is not really horror , its sifi . a adventure/drama/sifi . it really should have been about 100 to 200 pages longer . everything in it was really cool and fun to read but it just seemed rushed . and somethings were not really dove into thoroughly enough . the writting was dead on as always and character development was good . this book just needed another couple hundred pages to go from a barley average book to a great book
books	this was an amazing read . i could n't put it down . if you like csi , then you will love this books . the forensics are very interesting . you would never guess who the killer is ! i was totally shocked when i got to the end
books	the penguin guide is still the best in the business . it has its biases but you ca n't beat its comprehensiveness and the reviewers wide range and love of the music are evident
books	`` when i first came to iran , black clad women all seemed the same . scary unsmiling servants of the ayatollas '' having visited the islamic republic of iran in june , i was better prepared for that vast country portrayed by elaine sciolino in her book persian mirrors . i am more than grateful for this book , which alerted me to the diversity of cultures , and the general way of life so absolutely different from the western world . elaine sciolino made me so very aware of the perfect social world of the iranians and also i am thrilled to say that once you make a friend of an iranian , you have a friend for life . my most treasured memories of iran will never leave me and i thank ms sciolino for preparing me for that journey . reviewed by heather marshall negahdar ( sugar-cane 11/10/05 )
books	this is another piece of lowbrow anti-german propaganda dressed as historiography . the book is a mess of primary , yet selective and biased historical research , simplistic psycho-babble , ridiculous sociological-anthropological speculation , pathetic organization behavioural theorising and last but not least , absolutely third rate military history . the author is hell bent on proving that there is a german sonderweg from the founding of the second reich to hitler , that the vaunted german army is nothing but foolish automatons predisposed to atrocities and mindless offensives . all in all , cheap trash billed as history .
books	i love this book -- it 's beautiful . this book is a delightful romp through the farmyard , with goose leading the way across the pages as she chases a butterfly , causing the ruckus with all the animals . the abstract artwork truly appeals to adults and , therefore , may be too difficult for very young children to comprehend : the pigs in the muck , the kittens in the hayloft , the pigeons in the rafters all might be a little tough for a baby to distinguish . but a parent rereading the book several times in a row will appreciate seeing fleming 's gorgeous art each time . my nine-month-old son reacts to the colors with glee and my imitations of the animals with laughter -- this is definitely one of his favorites . i highly recommend this book
books	a surprisingly tiny book . ( the picture in the upper-left corner is nearly actual size . ) after receiving it , i immediately looked up its dimensions in the description on this page . it says 4.7 x 3.3 x 0.6 . i had not noticed that before i ordered it . the book seems much smaller than that . not that that is a problem ; it was just somewhat of a shock to find such a minuscule book when i opened the box . i believe it is intended to be carried with you in your pocket or glove box or the locket around your neck so you 'll have a chance to pick out a few choice topics of conversation before you enter a party or whatever . it certainly is not intended as bathroom reading . for one thing , the pages are much too small for emergency tp use . not that i am complaining , mind you . this is a gem of a book with over 200 interesting bits of trivia listed more or less alphabetically from `` the amish '' to `` zero '' . ( this is not to imply that the title of each page has much to do with the text , but who cares - the book is fun . ) each page has its stated `` fact '' and a follow-up paragraph to expound on the subject . also , there are a number of pages randomly strewn through the book with three `` instant personalities '' each - little tidbits of info about famous people . ( although , thomas jefferson got his own page , as did alfred hitchcock . ) and unlike another trivia book i purchased recently ( bla bla ) , the information here is actually correct . will and mangesh research their topics , not just publish un-provable `` facts '' gathered from the internet . use the contents with confidence .
books	i knew the government was a little crooked ... but when i read this ... .well ... lets just say i dont trust the government anymore . its a very great book , and fills you in on some information that you might have missed
books	rarely is there a book that i can not put down , this was an exception . quite a suspensfull page turner . any book that can draw you in and you can visualize the characters and the scenery is excellent and this book did that . i would have given it 5 stars , but i do not like romance blended in with any suspense novel , that 's just my taste . by far , however , one of the best books i have read in a long time
books	i only glanced through this book , yet my first impression is that it is a hodge podge of unrelated research without any attempt to analyze or comment on the results or even the quality of the research conducted or of the tools applied . i can , however , write about one of the editors , mike shaw , who made no attempt whatsoever to 'find the evidence ' when assessing us as parents . he works as a consultant child psychiatrist in london , england and seems to specialise in offering his services as an 'expert witness ' and trainer in the legal aspects of applying medical recommendations under the mental health act . we had our children taken away on the grounds that they were `` at risk of neglect '' . mike shaw was called in as an expert witness to interview us and make recommendations . yet the reports that he submitted to court were unbelievably sloppy and ill researched . under cross examination , he was vague and inarticulate and could provide no concrete evidence to support his assertions and recommendations . luckily for us , he was so glaringly incompetent that we were allowed to repeat the process with another expert psychiatrist . i do n't know about his co-editors , but if his work is anything to go by , the material that he collated in this book can only be equally sloppy and prejudiced . here are some extracts from the psychiatric report that he submitted to court . judge for yourself whether you can take anything this man does or says seriously . evidence-gathering . `` on 9.8.02 , i interviewed mr mrs orman [ 2 hours ] `` on 21.8.02 , i met the family at trent park where i spoke to mrs orman alone [ 40 mins ] , witnessed contact [ 1 hour ] and spoke to the children without their parents [ 20 mins ] [ and ] i interviewed the foster carer [ 2 hours ] . observations . `` mr mrs orman were friendly and co-operative throughout. [ ... ] mr orman showed insight [ ... but ] was n't concerned that his actions may have disadvantaged the children . the couple were very robust in refuting the [ welfare 's ] account , which they claimed was full of misunderstandings and misinformation . `` contact took place in the park [ ... ] the parents and children seemed happy to see each other ; they chatted in animated style . [ ... ] i was n't aware of either parent criticising the authorities in the children 's presence `` [ interviewing the children ] the children seemed attentive [ ... ] but answered `` do n't know '' , fell silent and looked at each other when i asked them questions [ ... ] erin related [ a simpsons episode where ] homer [ ... ] had lumps coming out of his head because he kept his anger inside . i found myself wondering whether this was an oblique reference to concern about mr orman 's temper but guessed that such an interpretation would be dismissed . [ note . this is submitted in court as an evidence-based legal document ! ] conclusions recommendations `` [ ... ] i observed mrs orman as shy and anxious while mr orman was very pleasant but forceful . [ ... ] `` mr and mrs orman say they have an easy affectionate bond with the children . so it is surprising that the foster carer finds the children uncomfortable with physical contact . [ ... ] i think there is some insecurity in the children 's attachment to their parents . [ note how this directly contradicts his own observations in the park . ] `` were mr orman to be caring for the children on his own , i would be concerned about his sensitivity to their needs . [ ... ] asked whether he had any regrets , mr orman did n't take any responsibility for the deprivation and disruption suffered by his children going into care . [ ... ] erin [ who was 8 at the time ] needs a parent who can stand up to her without losing their temper , and support and advise socially . i suspect mr orman would find this difficult . `` my concern about mrs orman managing the children on her own would be a recurrence of her illness . [ ... ] i wonder whether mrs orman has the strength and patience to handle these very challenging [ sic ] children . `` [ ... ] the children seemed very happy and natural with their parents during the contact i observed [ sic ] and the contact records make reference to the children wanting to go home . `` [ ... ] returning home is likely to further retard the children 's social and emotional development . [ ... ] `` these children have very little capacity to protect themselves from what is essentially emotional deprivation and possibly abuse . [ ... ] it is most unlikely that either parent can protect the children from any harm that the other parent might cause . i also find very plausible ms [ charlotte ] curran 's suggestion ( ... [ in ] her [ written ] statement ) that mr orman dominates his wife . `` the children did not express a wish to return home when they spoke to me , but it seems safest to assume they would prefer to be at home and would be alarmed if that was not possible . [ .. ] i believe the children need a long-term placement away from home with experienced foster carers . [ ... ] contact should be gradually reduced . '' mike shaw 's answers under cross-examination painted a dire picture of our mental competence and subsequent parenting abilities , but he was unable to point to any specific evidence that he had acquired in his 6-hour investigation . yet he remained adamant in his conclusion that the children should be removed from the family indefinitely and contact gradually reduced until no further contact be allowed , so that the children could lead a normal and happy life . he could not comment on government statistics that show that 70 % of all children placed in long-term foster care end up as delinquents . our children were eventually returned to us after we underwent a convoluted process to prove our competence as parents beyond a reasonable doubt ; and the case was eventually closed . so much for the scientific and critical appraisal of our family by a man who regularly provides expert legal evidence and trains psychiatrists in making competent medical recommendations that supposedly satisfy basic human rights conventions
books	book goes over a lot of information in a very short time , but not much of that information is worth anything unless you 're building a circle-track or drag car . took the hit and ordered stanforth 's competition car suspension
books	this novel could not hold my interest . i am an anne perry fan , but could not get into this book . i could n't really bond with any of the characters and the plot was uninteresting . i 'm really disappointed , because i was looking forward to a new series by her . joseph and matthew lost their parents to murder and joseph lost two close friends to murder , yet there did n't seem to be much emotion . maybe ms. perry tried to tell too many stories within one story . in reviewing the book , it 's hard to pin point exactly why i did n't like this book . i would skip this series and read the pitt series .
books	this book is the best book about baby face nelson , i enjoyed reading this book greatly . everything you wanted to know about lester gillis is in this book . every part of his life was explained in great detail ; the authors did not leave anything out . i highly recommend this book to people who are into the depression era gangsters
books	cooper 's book is yet another warm and fuzzy management guru text -- - from yet another management guru who never served a day as a real manager , of a real company . it contains all sorts of motherhood and apple pie stories -- - along with trite sayings such as `` when you find a back door that 's open , close it '' or my personal favorite `` use the lanterns of your life to help light the way . '' if you 're looking for an inspirational book , one with a solid basis , forget this one . you 'd be better off reading the daily horoscope
books	the joke here is that krugman is convinced he can write . he ends his little intro with the smug assertion that `` maybe economists can write after all , '' offering himself as proof . ( krugman can not write well , but he has mastered the clumsy , undistinguished style of a bad lit professor -- -the kind of tenured mediocrity that dominates academic publishing -- -an accomplishment he 's very proud of . to use his own favorite `` emphasizing '' gimmick : krugman stinks -- -full stop . ) the punchline is that shortly afterward , the new york times hired him . it was a match made in middlebrow heaven . ( i should add that i do like the substance of krugman 's newspaper articles , if not the style . an enemy of the current white house is a friend of mine . ) as far as the economics go , he 's pro-nafta and pro- '' free trade '' just like all establishment economists , and completely unwilling to critique the real forces at work in international markets . do n't waste your time
books	i have always been a fan of the star wars saga but never really read any of the novels . this was my first sw novel . i must say i want to be a sith . i just finished this novel last night and honestly want a 2nd coming . if u read the epilogue of this book u will grind your teeth ! the storyline at first felt familiar but then radically changed but had the sw ripple effects . i however got more excited because i played kotor/ep3 the game/kotor 2 and jedi academy so allot of the visuals and things in the book were already visualized for me in those games . i loved the entire transformation and how gradually even the sith were headed like the jedi in ep3 . it an amazing story and ca n't wait to a sequel if any .
books	from the introduction of basic concepts such as likelihood ratios and predictive values to the simple table format with the always beautiful netter illustrations , this is the ortho exam text to have . i just hope the next edition is being planned to keep pace with new research . thank you to joshua cleland for putting this together for us
books	when john grisham introduced us to bendini , lambert locke , a memphis tax boutique controlled by the mafia , the idea of an in-house firm for the mob was hilarious . these days no one , least of all our hero scott finn , is particularly sure that organized crime does n't just control the firm , but also the governor 's office , the us attorneys office and the boston pd . finn , who worked and fought his way out of the streets of southie to the thick-pile carpets of boston 's brahmin legal establishment , finds himself back among the thugs and characters of the world he thought he left behind . when a fellow associate and friend with benefits is killed by a copycat killer seeking to emulate `` little jack '' who was terrorizing the city finn is drawn into the fray , where he acquits himself brilliantly while maintaining his place on the partnership track . finn even finds a new love interest in the cop who is trying , though not very hard , to put him away . and a childhood friend proves an invaluable ally as finn attempts to clear himself and clean up the city in the process . if it seems over the top , it is . but it is good fun too
books	i would recomend this book to anyone , it is fantastic and funny . it made me laugh . it really took my imagination on an adventure . you really need to read this book .
books	this classic chronicle of presidential campaigns , from the get-go to contemporary times , has the unusual virtue of being useful either as a collection of short readable chapters - each just the right size for a daily bus or train ride - or as a reference source . reading this in the wake of monicagate and the florida recount , it 's instructive to read the history of grover cleveland , who seems to have features of both past democratic candidates . like clinton , he had his scandals - fathering an illegitimate child . like gore , his career was rudely interrupted by an election which he won on popular votes but lost , in a hotly contested , knife-edge electoral college tally
books	tim lahaye , jerry jenkins , and others in the pre-trib circle , such as ed hindson , tommy ice , chuck missler , etc. , continue to put forth the same deceptions that hal lindsey popularized decades ago . the notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture , it is foreign to the teachings of the early church , and it is grooming the church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming . these men are novices and not prophecy `` experts '' or `` scholars '' by any stretch of the imagination ; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible christians . why continue to be deceived ? tim cohen , in his excellent book , the antichrist and a cup of tea , provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming antichrist is known now . not only that , the same author ( tim cohen ) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture ever offered to the saints of god in christ : the real rapture . if you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture , then you need to hear tim cohen 's the real rapture ( based on a volume in his forthcoming `` messiah , history , and the tribulation period '' series ( see prophecy house 's web site for details on these items )
books	i loved this book . the food was really good and fast ( which is good because i have a very packed schedule ) . also great if you 're on a budget . the recipes have variations so i could eat different things but not have to buy a whole new set of ingrediants . the only reason it did n't get five stars was because some of the food was really spicy ( i 'm from texas , i like spicy ) , to the point my boyfriend could n't eat it . i just modified the recipes and everything was fine
books	this book was on a very interseting topic . the author took time in studying this topic . it was about the impending world oil shortage . that is the time when we , the world , will run out of oil . it tells you about hubbert 's analysis of the time or year when the world will run out of oil . they then talk about a lot of other things like where oil comes from . then they talk about where oil is . they also talk about drilling for oil . they say it takes people over 20 drills to find oil . sometimes it will take even more time then that . then they talk about the size of oil fields . they also reexamine hubbert 's analysis later on in the book . rate plots is brought up because the more people driving the less oil we will have in the future . they talk about the future to fossil fuels and discuss elctricity and natural gases . they also talk about how much we already have so when oil runs out we need to think about all the stuff we already have . hubbert was a brilliant man . some gas companys tried to make him stay quiet but he did n't want to he told everybody . the author was ver knowledgable and i could tell he knew what he was talking about . i would n't recommend this book to anybody unless they are very smart and want to know about the impending world oil shortage . i say again the author took time in studying this topic but that was his downfall in that he went into to much depth and made it boring . when you read it you can tell the author knew what he was talking about but he got to much into detail which is very boring . i gave it a low rating because i have a short attenion span so it was hard enough for me to make it through this book
books	david fromkin 's `` peace to end all peace '' is simultaneously a comprehensive and very flawed work . many of the reasons for it being one can be found in the other . fromkin attempts to examine how the modern middle east ( extending as far as afghanistan and some sections of central asia ) was created during and after the first world war . obviously , in order to do this , the fall of the ottoman empire in that war must be considered . this is where fromkin 's unusual methodology comes into play . focusing on the european political machinations to resolve the `` eastern question '' in their favour , the sorry tale becomes one more of churchill and te lawrence than of the arabs and turks who were also involved in the process . admittedly , it was the europeans who wielded the whip hand in deciding just where the borders were to be drawn , but reducing key figures such as the cup triumvirate in the dying ottoman empire ( and kemal ataturk in turkey immediately thereafter ) to the status of supporting players ultimately skews the focus of the book too much . never let it be said that this is a simple story to retell . a complex web of national and personal political interests in both europe and the middle east combined to make the region what it is today , and any study of all of these will be faced with the need for convoluted explanations . the problem that fromkin has , however , is that he does not make these very well at all . the story is told in a roughly chronological manner , which means that we jump from place to place and meet a bewildering array of characters . ultimately , the only real result is confusion on the part of the reader , who is constantly flipping backwards to see who the latest figure to make an appearance actually is . additionally , fromkin frequently confuses his readers with references to geographical features which are not well-shown on the maps provided . indeed , one map ( showing enver pasha 's advance on baku and his campaigns in central asia ) is laughable in the extreme . the legend explains that the direction of the arrows is the direction of the various advances - which would be significantly more useful were the arrows in fact arrows , and not equilateral triagles . where fromkin does well , however , is in his use of purely european sources . it is perhaps unusual to say this of a book intending to tell the story of the modern middle east , but i have considerable doubts about the depth of his research into the middle eastern aspects of the events in question . in terms of europe , however , his research seems to cover the major bases of exactly what the key figures believed and did . ultimately , `` a peace to end all peace '' is a difficult and not particularly rewarding work . a diplomatic history of europe during the great war can be written much better than this , and a history of the development of the middle east following that conflict already has been ( the chapters in margaret attwood 's `` the peacemakers '' or william cleveland 's `` modern middle east '' both easily outshine this )
books	one reviewer claims that this is marred by some of eliot 's unfurtunate preducices . but how come you do n't say something like that about o ' henry . we ca n't just stop reading authers because you we do n't like their views . someone calls hemingway looking forward ? if that 's looking forward i'de rather look backward . hemingway has no concept of lyricism what so ever . most of the people that reviewer named justly loved eliot . eliot is not looking nesscarily towards the past , but towards what we have made out of the present . in name of progress , we have destroyed nature and good part of our souls . to call eliot conservative at the time he wrote the poem would be redicoulous , the first draft according to one of eliot 's biographers , was absolutly a expression of relavtism . one critic accused him being a nihilist . on the poem itself eliot is truly a master at evocating mode and tone , not to mention his brilliant use of imperfect rymthe . so it does n't have the crepty sentimentalism and redicoulous forays of expression of eariler and later poets . so he looks at his poetry with a sense of hard classicism , we could use more of that . yet what he does n't right he evoces through mode and tone , giving us truly one of the best poems of this , or any other century .
books	some of patterson 's conclusions were a bit of a reach . some of his segways were n't all that smooth . but this book is just plain entertaining . it is chopped full of stories on rockstars making deals with the devil , lingering around after death , and backed up with just enough innuendo-ish research for it to almost be believable . well , some of it actually believable . patterson scribes on about various rockstar-occult alliances ( in particular the rolling stones and led zeppelin ) and uses quotes from the musicians themselves .
books	this book is very disappointing , as is most of gunaratna 's work on islamist terrorism . it 's the sort of stuff governments and many of the public want to hear , ie . bin laden and aq are everywhere , responsible for every terrorism attack and all regional terorist groups ( such as ji ) are aq franchises - total bollocks . the book lacks solid and verifiable reserach and is written by a `` scholar '' who spends most of his time doing alarmist media commentary
books	although i 'm not new to wwii histories , the first world war is one of my favorite historical periods to read about and one of my favorite books from that war is alistar horne 's `` the price of glory . '' since i enjoyed reading about one if wwi 's most epic battles , i did not hesitate to read `` stalingrad : the fateful siege '' by antony beevor . in both works , comparisons are made between the battles of verdun and stalingrad and for good reasons . both battles were initiated by german forces that underestimated the tenacity of their enemy , the course of battle spun wildly beyond their commander 's control , and both battles cost a near unimaginable loss of life and human suffering . beevor is especially keen on the amount of human agony throughout the battle of stalingrad , which makes the book gutwrenching but at the same time the reader is unable to put it down . from the well-documented cold , lice , and hunger that haunted russian and german soldier alike , to the disease and desperation experienced by the sixth army as they were slowly strangled in zhukov 's trap , it seems that beevor has overlooked nothing . unlike many battle histories that may focus on stategy or political fallout of the conflict , the emphasis on human suffering and heroism in beevor 's work makes the reader sympathize for russians , germans , romanians , and anyone else unlucky enough to get caught in the battle . not only does beevor shed light on the plight of ordinary soldiers , he also examines the more famous players in the battle ; including a paranoid stalin , a dreaming hitler , a finger-pointing von manstein , and a indecisive paulus . indeed , the reader gains perspective from rastenburg and moscow all the way down the heirarchy to the frozen bunkers of stalingrad . overall , `` stalingrad : the fateful siege '' is an excellent book that is recommended for anyone interested in world war ii or just any hard-hitting military history
books	i thought this book was supposed to help you construct a very useful and pretty small house on a budget . i was wrong . instead , it is about not too big houses where you spend tens of thousands , if not hundreds of thousands , on all kinds of architectural extravagances . perhaps this book could have a subtitle : how to spend a million dollars on a 1,500 square foot house . if you are looking to build a house efficiently and cheaply , this is the wrong book
books	i was at the airport , getting ready to fly out to cali and i found this book in the airport gift shop- i thought what a stroke of luck i had getting a stephen king title at such a juncture ... i 'm a huge fan . despite the fact that i started and finished the book exactly as the plane took off and landed , i was sorely disappointed . much ado about nothing would be an overstatement
books	this is an essential read for anyone who wants a deeper understand of american foreign policy . a year after this book was published , there were over a hundred reviews . regardless of whiether one disagrees or agrees with the author , finds the author right or wrong , interesting or boring , this book is one of the most influential books , if not the most influential book that affected american foreign policy . in fact , the current bush adminstration 's policies , george kenan 's containment , henry kissinger 's policies as well as countless adminstration 's policies are shaped or affected by this book . my area of study is the foreign policy of post world war two american governments , and never have i understood it with greater clarity after i read this book . it is the thread which runs through the policies of all the administrations , differing on extent . ( i studied the policies first and read the book the year after ) . it is a fascinating book and hard to put down . the author writes in a european style ( beautiful long sentences , etc . ) , which in my opinion makes it more eloquent and in the opinion of my co-students makes it more difficut to read . he tries to give a balanced perspective from which one can think critically . ms. rice and mr. kissinger were heavily influenced by this book . to understand them , this is a must read . in and of itself , it is an excellent book , a classic , and thousands others significantly more qualified than i have reviewed it . look even at other reviews on this website or at well known journals for a more accurate assement of the book itself by political scientists
books	pictures via camera reflect not only what the photographer sees , but what he thinks about . the most successful reflect an understanding of things as much as their image , and jerry thompson 's exploration of the relationship between seeing and thinking in truth and photography provides a set of fine duotone photos to illustrate essays reflecting on working photography experiences
books	james moseley was the stereotypical rich orphan trust-fund kid , inheriting millions while still in college . he promptly left college and attached himself to a shady , indiana-jones-style south american graverobber . the graverobber wanted for some reason to do a book on the flying saucer myth , then only a few years old . moseley was sent crisscrossing the us to interview anyone and everyone who had made contributions to that myth in the period 1947 - 1954 . the book never materialized , but moseley was left with extensive notes , and the indelible and accurate impression that , apart from a few people who had genuinely seen something in the sky they did n't recognize , and would have been expected to if it were anything familiar , the majority of the mythmakers were , as my old grandma used to say , `` crazy as a betsy-bug . '' over the years moseley kept his hand in , meeting and interviewing anyone who came onto the scene in what he sometimes calls the field , other times ( more accurately ) `` ufoology .

books	ethan mordden 's editors have allowed him to ruin what could possibly have been a good book . this is the worst of his books on the various decades of the broadway musical as the faults of the seventies book have widened into gulfs . his political ramblings ( often just slightly right of ann coulter and making as much sense ) seep through the book , dragging it down . the french people are slammed a number of times , along with the aclu , burt lancaster ( apparently , according to ethan a good friend of stalin ) and the left in general , while the author defends bush ( and it does take some looking back over the page to figure out how he fits all this into a book on musical theatre ) . the author 's train of thought wanders like a bitter old man all over the page in search of a target , any target . it is often hard to stomach . the truly sad fact about this is that the author often has quite cogent things to say about a particular musical and when he does stick to that , it can actually make one want to look at the work again . an editor should have cleaned the work up before before allowing it on stage to greet its public . the author is capable of better work
books	first off , i want to say that i can not believe the audacity some people have in the censure and harsh remarks towards this brilliant young man ! shame on you ! the book its self is great , great use of language , story and wonderful imagination . to be so rediculous as to pull this young man up on grammatical structure and lexical syntax is rediculous ! who cares ! talk about looking for somthing to criticize , this young man brought his dream to life and became a best selling author and even the man behind a full feature major motion picture ! ! ! gee wizz , most would have difficulty reading a novel and getting off their back side to hire a dvd let alone make the whole damn thing yourself happen ! help or no help , he made it work , he is a vital part in the chain and all props to you my friend ! ! !
books	why read a book from 1857 which flopped so badly as commercial literature that melville stopped writing and ended his career as a customs official ? because this book masterfully explores the entire nature of trust , confidence and cons . though the setting is a riverboat on the mississippi river just before the u.s. exploded into civil war , its insights cross cultural boundaries . this is not an easy book to read for several reasons . first , it is undoubtedly one of the first `` post-modern '' novels which breaks from traditional narrative storytelling . ( another example : dostoevsky 's notes from the underground . ) the confidence-man is a collection of 45 conversations between various people on the riverboat -- beggars , absurdly dressed frontiersmen , sickly misers , shysters , patent medicine hucksters , veterans ( of the mexican-american war ) and the `` hero '' in the latter part of the book , the cosmopolitan . in typical melville fashion , you also get asides -- directly to the reader , in several cases , as if melville felt the need to address issues of fiction outside the actual form of his novel . the lack of structure , action and conclusion make this a post-modern type book , but if you read each conversation as a separate story , then it starts to make more sense . for what ties the book together is not a story but a theme : the nature of trust and confidence . in a very sly way , melville shows how a variety of cons are worked , as the absolutely distrustful are slowly but surely convinced to do exactly what they vowed not to do : buy the `` herbal '' patent medicine , buy shares in a bogus stock venture , or donate cash to a suspect `` charity . '' in other chapters , it seems like the con artist is either stopped in his tracks or is conned himself . since the book is mostly conversations , we are left to our own conclusions ; there is no authorial voice wrapping up each chapter with a neatly stated ending . this elliptical structure conveys the ambiguous nature of trust ; we do n't want to be taken , but confidence is also necessary for any business to be transacted . to trust no one is to be entirely isolated . melville also raises the question : is it always a bad thing to be conned ? the sickly man seems to be improved by his purchase of the worthless herbal remedy , and the donor conned out of his cash for the bogus charity also seems to feel better about himself and life . the ornery frontiersman who 's been conned by lazy helpers softens up enough to trust the smooth-talking employment agency owner . is that a terrible thing , to trust despite a history of being burned ? the ambuiguous nature of the bonds of trust is also explored . we think the cosmopolitan is a con-man , but when he convinces a fellow passenger to part with a heavy sum , he returns it , just to prove a point . is that a continuance of the con , or is he actually trustworthy ? the book is also an exploration of a peculiarly american task : sorting out who to trust in a multicultural non-traditional society of highly diverse and highly mobile citizens . in a traditional society , things operate in rote ways ; young people follow in their parents ' traditional roles , money is made and lent according to unchanging standards , and faith/tradition guides transactions such as marriage and business along well-worn pathways . but in america , none of this structure is available . even in melville 's day , america was a polyglot culture on the move ; you had to decide who to trust based on their dress , manner and speech/pitch . the con , of course , works on precisely this necessity to rely on one 's senses and rationality rather than a traditional network of trusted people and methods . so the con man dresses well and has a good story , and an answer for every doubt . the second reason why melville is hard to read is his long , leisurely , clause upon clause sentences . but the book is also peppered with his sly humor , which sneaks up on you ... well , just like a good con .

books	as a long time admirer of art and a first time beginner of actually tapping my artistic well , this text is like having a private mentor guiding you through specific progressive exercises . it 's language is quaint and cozy to modern ears , having first been written in 1856 . but it is practical , clear and encouraging . it dispells the idea that only certain people can draw . and by focussing on drawing with pencil , it provides the foundation for using any other media . a wonderful find
books	i had to read this book for a political theory class in college . after talking with several other members i was happy to find out that i do not have the reading skills of a third grader ... benhabib goes out of her way to use vocabulary words that most educated people are not familiar with . the book is also not organized well . in order to really understand this book you will have to read it while taking notes . points that could be grouped together for arguments are scattered throughout entire chapters and even the whole book . benhabib may have used her vocabulary and lack of organization as tools to hide that the points she makes are not very well argued . throughout much of the book benhabib is trying to shoot down the theories of john rawls and other theorists to support her views on migratory rights . to be honest , i disagree with her views and admit that i might have found her organization and vocabulary more tolerable if i agreed with her . still , i do not have a problem with her making these claims if she did so logically . much of her work is based on telling the reader why other people are wrong and she will use theories she supposedly already disproved in one arguement to justify her later arguments for disagreeing with other theories . in short , i do not think anyone would want to read this book for pleasure , or intellectual curiosity . if you have to read the rights of others for a class , i extend my condolences .
books	this is one of the best biographies i have ever read . you can tell the authors put a lot of time and effort into this work - it 's a true labor of love . filled with beautiful photos and extensive bibliographical notes , this one is a keeper . who knew miss francis was such a `` wild child '' ? whether you 're a film scholar or a movie buff , lynn kear 's book deserves a special spot in your bookcase .
books	this book does n't make any sense . it is so , so , so b-o-r-i-n-g . the book is not well written , and the sentences are way too short . i woud n't recommand this book to anyone
books	after talking to several pharmaceutical reps i know , i decided to shoot for a sales rep job myself . this book gives some very good insight into what it takes to land a job in the industry , what kind of people you 'll be dealing with , what the hiring pricess is like ( with particular emphasis on the interviews ) , and then what the job is like for people who manage to get hired . i 'm very glad that i took the time to read this book because , after finishing it , i realize that being a pharmaceutical sales rep sounds like one of the most horrible careers imaginable . obviously this is simply my own opinion , and i know there are plenty of people out there who enjoy this kind of work , but nearly every single thing about it , from the superficial way applicants are screened , to the shameless pandering that sales reps must do on the job , sounds simply awful to me . if you are considering a career as a drug rep , you should definitely do your homework to make sure it 's really something you would enjoy . this book may very well convince you that you would love it . if so , that 's great , and i hope you are successful . but if this kind of work is not right for you , this book can be equally helpful because you 'll find out by reading it what the job is really like . there are a lot of books on this subject on the market right now , and although this one was helpful , i have to say that i think insider 's guide to the world of pharmaceutical sales by jane williams is far more comprehensive and detailed than this one . if you only buy one book , definitely buy that one instead . but if you buy two books , pharmaceutical landing is a good second choice . one more thing : there 's some sweet irony about this book that i just have to report . the author goes to great lengths describing how he scrutinizes every single thing about job applicants , from their shoes to their body language . he also stresses well-written resumes and cover letters . one obvious piece of advice is that job applicants spell check everything before submitting it . imagine my surprise , then , when on the very next page it says candidates should `` ... right a short paragraph ... '' about their job experiences . it seems to me that someone who is going to be as critical as this author is about job candidates ought to take the time to spell check his own book
books	there was nothing in this book that our association has n't covered nearly every week . i was very dissapointed . it offered little tidbits like `` a postgame review can help you learn from experience '' . do n't we all do `` postgame reviews '' , even if it is simply going over the game in our head on the drive home ? i certainly do . no , i 'm not he best umpire in our association . i would rate myself as somewhere in the middle . the book offered me nothing new , nothing that our association does n't talk about constantly . buy a childress , or save your money
books	tedious and inane come to mind . it is written as a first person narrative consisting almost entirely of a stream of disparaging comments about everyone else written in a `` catty '' pseudo-feminist style , rambling descriptions of egyptian archaeology - real or imagined - thinly veiled racist comments about the `` ignorant natives '' of egypt and inept sexual innuendo . the book is very slow moving and the plot seems forced . the characters do not come across as real . very disappointing . leave this one on the library shelf
books	excellent book , if you are interest in ancient egypt , read this book , you 'll learn a lot of interesting facts about the valley of the kings , the pharaohs , etc .

books	let me first say that once upon a time i liked larry the cable guy . after reading this book , i now think he is one step above slime . to be fair , some jokes are funny and some stories are enjoyable and amusing . he is anti-pc which is totally fine with me and even goes as far to pick on some appropriate targets like rosie o'donnell , michael moore , barney frank , barbara streisand , and `` that fat girl from the dixie chicks '' , among others . no problem there in my opinion . that is the entirety of the positive things i can say about the book . the rest is just babble , often repeated over and over again , that even larry lovers will find annoying . a couple things that really bothered me . the first is his constant and unrelenting picking on and making jokes at the expense of `` retards '' and down 's syndrome children . he must use the term `` retard '' at least fifty+ times in the book . this is appreciably different than making a joke about , say , michael moore . moore made the decisions and taken the actions in his life to make him an apt target for jokes . the down 's syndrome children did not . my opinion of larry the cable guy dropped to zero or below after reading his attack on `` retards '' . he also racially sterotypes in the book . many of these jokes can be funny if taken in context and at least those people can respond . the down 's syndrome kids ca n't . larry , i can only hope god ( in whom you so mightly believe in according to your book ) grants you a `` retard '' child to love and care for . then , i would like to read your next book . i suspect you would gain some sorely needed wisdom very quickly . the second theme in the book that came through loud and clear is that larry is a fraud in many senses . he plays the good 'ol bubba . he ai n't too bright and he ai n't ever changed since he left the farm . his `` celebrity '' - his word not mine - has not gone to his head . ok , larry . why then the better than thou tone throughout the book - including speeches and lectures , including serious topics such as abortion ? why do virtually every one of your stories and jokes involve putting someone else down ? why the unrelenting references to your `` celebrity '' ? the terms `` meet and greet '' and `` after-party '' were used over and over and over , as an example . do you really think your fans have ever been to one of these events or even know what they are ? well , you are wrong . they are mentioned constantly to remind everyone how big of a star you have become . that 's hollywood-speak my country , fart loving , nose picking friend . overall , this book is a true disappointment and larry the cable guy is a true moron ( see does n't that sound better than `` retard '' ) . my father always taught me there are two types of dumb people . those who are dumb and know they are dumb . and those who are dumb but are so dumb , they do n't realize it . the former category usually shuts up ( knowing they are dumb ) . the latter category normally rambles on and on like some drunk in the gutter . the first group is obviously smarter than the second . larry the cable guy falls smack dab in the last group . the fact that he has stumbled into some sense of success is fueling his rambling and babbles in this book . make jokes , larry , and forget about your opinions on say abortion and the like . unfortunately , larry ca n't see the obvious . like virtually every celebrity he cites and makes fun of in the book , he has become exactly one of them . a thin layer of `` good 'ol boy '' on top , covering a core of venom and `` celebrity '' . he plays the role pretty good until one gets under the sheets . my suggestion : do n't buy larry 's act and , by all means , do n't buy the book .
books	the language , the words , the concepts , the illustrations , the points he brings out , everything in this book is beautiful . the metaphors he will use to get a certain point across , is brilliant , simple , creative , nimble ; he dances around philosophical discussion with grace . he explains relativism , and absolutism , quite well , and puts you in the crossfire , to make up your mind ; he shows you , but does n't tell you ; he offers you ; he willingly gives you ; the truth . buy this book
books	if you want to believe an illusion , go for it . some readers say he is well informed . whoa . this guy talks about science without any credentials to do so . if it makes you feel good to believe that the us is bad , the environment is collapsing , and we need socialism to survive , then this is the book for you . if you are open minded but want truthful facts to make your own opinion , find another source . waste of money

books	the handbook of tibetan buddhist symbols by robert beer ( who has studied and practice tibetan thanga painting for more than thirty years ) is a straightforward reference guide to the meaningful symbolism of sacred tibetan art . black-and-white illustrations depict all the major buddhist symbols and motifs , while the text offers depth and interpretation behind the meaning and usage of each . the handbook of tibetan buddhist symbols is enthusiastically recommended for inclusion into buddhist studies and especially informative for connoisseurs of tibetan art
books	what a wonderful book . it 's too bad so many readers today know only tom wolfe , not thomas wolfe . even though it has been at least 10 years since reading look homewood angel , i knew almost immediately when i came to the new sections . they add a depth to the novel , bringing in the whole town and relatives , rather being only about eugene gant . my favorite wolfe readings involve trains ; the experience about time stopping for a moment when you look into the eyes of someone looking directly at you into the train , is exactly as i remember my earlier train rides.what are they doing now , that the train has passed ? other 800 page books might be dull , but not this one . having been given it as a present recently , i am very surprised and disappointed that it is already 'out of print . '' more people should know about o lost
books	i was optimistic when i saw the title , but you know that old saying , `` do n't judge a book by its cover . '' the author has a few legitimate ideas , but any google search could come up with the same information in greater depth and better accuracy . she condemns saving animals from shelters and actually encourages people to breed animals to increase the pet population . she is no more a pet lover than i am a supermodel . her ideas are based solely on money . even if it encourages starting a puppy mill ( euphemistically referred to as a dog breeder ) . early in her book she mentions the titles of a few other books she recommends ( i have chosen not to seek them out ) , but she says do n't spend your money on them , just go to the library and check them out . if you insist on reading this book i give you the same advice . do not buy this book -- check it out from your local library ! then do google searches to get more in-depth , accurate information about any of the four decent ideas she did have , or come back to amazon.com and find a more specific book that can actually be of use . oh , and by the way , the world is already overpopulated with unwanted pets . encouraging people to add to the problem is morally reprehensible
books	although everything is shown in silhouette , there is plenty of color and action and my kids ( boy and girl ; now 3 and 5 ) have always like it . there are herds of elephants , steaming machines , flowers , critters and more . as the first spotlight reviewer did a good job of summarizing the assortment of critters and things that one can find i wo n't say more . but in regards to the use of silhouettes instead of pictures or detailed line drawings at least one reviewer has said that they did n't like them . but i think they miss the point . the book is about *shapes* and how much you *can* identify without the `advantage ' of a detailed picture . and looking at the silhouette and identifying the item/creature is part and parcel of the mental exercise , just like the rhythm and rhyme of the story . if you used pictures you 'd hardly learn anything about `shapes ' would you . no , the use of shadows is just right for exercising young minds . for reaching for that aristotelian abstract ( lol ) of what is `skunk ' . and it is amazing how even the littlest of people can tell a skunk from a cat even with seuss ' odd artwork . five stars . 19 pages of fun for boys and girls . this sturdy boardbook is a good read-aloud that stretches the imagination
books	as china re-emerges as a dominant power in the 21st century , much will hinge on the beliefs of the people in that country when it comes to the actions it takes and tolerates around the world . oddly , the fascism of the communist regime remains largely in place in the era following mao 's disastrous reign , even as capitalism and other western ideals spread like wildfire through this huge , heavily-populated , and ( from a western perspective ) oftentimes strange land . aikman does an excellent job of covering the basic bullet points of the history of christianity in china , as well as introducing readers to the many chinese christians who have led or continue to lead the church in their country . on a recent trip to china , i was highly impressed by the deep generosity , humility , resourcefulness , strength , perseverance , and kindness exhibited by chinese of all ages . this spirit hums just below the surface in the stories aikman tells of the christian chinese and their faith . this spirit is also , i believe , one of the major reasons why the life and teachings of jesus seem to so easily take root in the hearts of so many chinese . also , those who are concerned that a `` christian china '' would somehow gut the land of its culture and heritage while propping up a westernized facsimile in its place should rest easy . it seems that the faith is spreading through this nation in a very distinctly chinese way
books	if you 're only slightly interested in the ways the evolution works , then this is it . but beware to have some knowledge about the basics of evolution before moving on to this book . there 's a bit of a steep learning curve when you 're not all to familiair with darwin 's brilliant theory . it also gives a nice insight in the way scientists work
books	this is the best reference i 've seen for it interviews . i 've seen many of these questions at interviews and at one it appeared they had pulled questions from the book . the technology specific questions are excellent
books	one of the spotlight reviewers says that by combining two great characters -- sunny randall and jesse stone -- robert b. parker has doubled our fun . quite the reverse . he has cut it in half . the characterizations of sunny and jesse are enormously feeble ; and the the rest of the characters are no great shakes , either . sunny 's irish mafia uncle is a cardboard cutout . suitcase simpson has three funny lines and is heard from no more . the villains -- buddy , erin , missy , gerard , moon -- are little more than vague names and stereotyping . spike is relegated to a scene and a half . oddly , the only interesting character is a very minor one : eddie . but he only stays around for 10 minutes even the plot is tissue-thin . the love-story is lame ; the sex-scenes boring . worst of all , who should appear but ( christ ! ) susan silverman , from the spenser series : one of the dampest and most wooden and least interesting characters in fiction . as with `` cold service '' and some others , parker is just coasting with this one . he is capable of far better .
books	i am an avid reader and could not make it through this book . his other books were so good . i could not have predicted what a disapointment this book would turn out to be . in applying some of the recommended techniques , my 11 year old daughter , emily , thought i lost my mind . thank goodness things are back to normal . we are both much healthier having now dispensed with the advice
books	i have progressively become more and more disappointed with rita mae brown 's books in the past decade . her early books were utterly magnificent ; now , she rarely if ever deviates from her favorite ( and by now , utterly boring ) themes -- southern manners , horse bloodlines , and foxhunting . blessedly , `` whisker of evil '' was foxhunting-free , but suffered from a heavy-handed overload of the previous two . rita mae brown would be wise to remember that there is a big world outside of her corner of virginia , and many of us have grace , manners , and respect for others -- and we do n't take kindly to being told that only virginians understand these things . that 's just simply not true . that said , there were some delightful aspects of `` whisker of evil '' -- the mystery itself was great , the animal characters were adorable as ever , and i loved learning more about harry as a person and what makes her tick . her quitting the post office was a great ( and very unexpected ) twist . i liked reading more about her home and her relationships . however , the stultifying minutiae of horse bloodlines was beyond me ; was this directed at a heretofore-unknown segment of rita mae brown 's fan base ? it was so out of context in this book ; certain details contributed to the horses ' relationships to one another , but she took it way too far and i found myself skipping pages . as well , i almost threw the book across the room when i came across a line that stated in so many words that only virginians have manners . this is a common theme of ms. brown 's and it is quite frankly offensive . there is a big , big world outside of virginia -- rita mae brown should know this , she has lived in it -- but her books and characters have become so parochial , insular and snobbish that it is an insult to those of us who do live elsewhere in that big world . i would have thought these kinds of statements were tongue-in-cheek if it was n't such a recurring theme in so many of her books over the past decade . enough already about southern manners ( a biased perception at best ) , ancestor worship , bloodlines ( human and horse ) , and foxhunting . whatever happened to characters like celeste chalfonte
books	this book of eight stories by virginia woolf shows virginia 's mind at work demonstrating her `` stream of consciousness . '' each story flows from one thought to another asking different questions about life . for example , `` the mark on the wall '' questions the meaning of life and existence . `` an unwritten novel '' is about what people hide and what you do n't know about a person you seat next to on an `` omnibus . '' all these stories will make you look at life in a slightly different way
books	suggest for all genuinely interested in this topic , to refer to rabbi david berger 's book , the rebbe , the messiah & amp ; the scandal of orthodox indifference
books	maybe it is me but this novel was about as exciting as watching the grass grow . it is the first mystery novel that i have read by a female author and i hope that it is not representative of the gender . but , by the reviews here , all by women , i can see that jance writes to that crowd . her readers seem to like being taken down the aimless boring pass of relationship drible . if you want to spend 10 pages with the main character sitting and talking about nothing in her mothers house or on her friends porch talking about their health than this book is for you . it is amazing that jance can start great with the murder scene and then 200 pages later start uncovering her first clue , the insulin bottle . jance gives no indication that oak vista or the stranded stranger are even remotely related to the story . do not start this book it is absolutely a total waste of time . if you want a good mystery read coben , crais , patterson or michael connely
books	i have not read the original version of this work , but the translation lacks originality and art . a beautiful story , but the writing style lacks grace and creativity . this is the only time i have liked a movie better than the book . do yourself a favor and skip the book . the movie is quite beautiful and moving
books	you do n't have to be a fan of `` old '' hollywood to enjoy this wonderful book about a famous restaurant and its even more famous clientele . fascinating stories accompanied by wonderful pictures . this is only enhanced by the actual recipes of this great restaurant . a wonderful coffee table book that will start conversations about movies , movie stars and great food
books	his basic thesis is that a liberal empire can be a greatly positive force in the world , and that the united states is already an empire , but that our inablility to acknowledge the fact leads us to waste our opportunities to be the afore mentioned positive force . ferguson writes that america is plagued by an attention deficit disorder and too much love of the good life . thus , we get distracted too easily from important events overseas , and when we do try to intervene , we want quick fixes and low costs . i could n't agree more with most of these points . as an american , i 'm greatly ashamed of our collective ignorance . i hate feeling like a foreigner in my our country because i watch the news or can find sumatra on a map . also , the book strikes a chord with me because of my frustration with half measures in foreign interventions . countless times , i believe america has done more harm than good by , if you will , talking the talk but not walking the walk . if we commit to something , we need to follow through . this is as true in iraq today as it has been in the past . we 've claimed to support democracy in latin america , but then turned bannana republics into bannana autocracies . we greatly prolonged and increased vietnam 's suffering without changing the end result at all . with all this commonality , however , there are a few leaps of logic that ferguson makes that i ca n't bring myself to agree with . basically , he did n't sell me on the thought that the imperial model is the best way to develop the world . how are we supposed to know what is best for everyone ? wo n't our own biases and self interests inevitably distort even our most altruistic efforts ? when ferguson hold 's up the british empire as a model of success , i ca n't help but notice that the best results came only to those places of british colonization , with horrendous consequences for each of the native populations there . and the two greatest examples of beneficial american imperialism - japan and germany - were already highly developed before world war ii , so it probably was n't that much of a wonder that we were able to help them return to such a state . even if the positive power of empire is conceded , there are important differences between the state of world during the british empire and the state of the world now . it 's a concern of immunity from repercussions . in the golden age of imperialism , europe was in a kind of splendid isolation from its empires . not to say that there were no reprercussions , but , with the only modern navies in the world , europe was immune to any very serious threats . on the other hand , in today 's world , as an effect of globalization , power has become more decentralized in some respects . think wmds , terrorists , and foreign investments in the u.s. economy , for example . can america as easily afford to make enemies in the developing world as the british could ? in the end `` colossus '' did n't settle any agruments for me , but raised new and interesting questions . it is a book that makes you think , and that in and of itself is worth four stars .

books	according to charles kimball , religion is the most powerful and pervasive force on earth . religion inspires humans to transcend their self-interests , while at the same time , more evil has been committed in the name of religion than any other human institution . using a comparative religious approach , kimball uncovers five warning signs that increase the likelihood of a religion becoming unhealthy or evil . kimball argues the word `religion ' is amorphous and difficult to define . as a result , the author believes a comparative religious methodology is necessary , one that sees the similarities and interconnectedness of all religions . kimball , next , asks if religion is the cause of evil , and he answers both yes and no . a religion that is arrogant , condescending , and requires adherents to `` disconnect their brain '' is problematic . on the other hand , religion opens up humanity to a universe of purpose and beauty and teaches how to live meaningful and moral lives as individuals and in community . kimball seeks to discover the signs that increase the likelihood of religion becoming evil . the first warning sign that religion is displaying tendencies towards evil is the belief and adherence to absolute truth claims . when conceptualizations of god are held with certainty and rigid doctrine , the propensity towards evil increases dramatically . sacred texts , sources of wisdom and guidance , become abused when selective readings of the text are used to reinforce these absolute truth claims . christianity and islam have missionary mandates , but these become imperialistic when conversion is forced because of absolute truth claims . kimball argues for a `` human view of truth '' , one that is dynamic and relational , allowing adherents to affirm truth without solidifying truth claims into absolute propositions . another pivotal point when religion becomes evil is blind obedience : when adherents abdicate personal responsibility to religious authorities . when a charismatic leader demands total obedience , has unrestricted power , and has total control , religion is unhealthy . uncritical acceptance of doctrine is also unhealthy , as authentic religion encourages questions and reflection . strict segregation from the larger society , combined with a leader with unlimited power is dangerous . kimball asserts that religious inquiry and freedom of thought are necessary for responsible religious adherence . every religious tradition believes that something is awry on earth , while some believe that an ideal time will arrive in the future . when adherents believe they can speak for god and wish to usher in this time , the likelihood for disaster increases . many muslims embrace the hope for an all islamic society , zealous jewish settlers dream of a time when israel will be returned to its divinely promised status , and the christian religious right believe that america should be politically structured with christian principles in mind . kimball opines those who narrowly define temporal structures of the state and those who believe they are god 's agents to usher in a theocracy are dangerous . religion also becomes a force for evil when the ends justify any means : when one theological component gets elevated , thus becoming an end , and adherents become consumed with achieving or protecting this end . all religions have notions of sacred space , but an unhealthy religion becomes obsessed with protecting this space . reinforcing or protecting group identity against an `other ' , or protecting group identity from within the group , are also potentially dangerous signs . institutional structures develop in all religious traditions , but corruption occurs when the protection of the institution becomes the end . kimball asserts that a healthy religion preserves the connection between means and ends . the last warning sign occurs when religious leaders believe their struggle is a `` holy '' war . kimball outlines the history of pacifism to the just war theory and crusader ideals within christianity , and he shows how each of these views were represented in the gulf war of 1990-91 . islam is a peaceful religion , which asks adherents to build a just and peaceful social order . the word jihad means `` struggling in the way of god , '' but in a narrower sense jihad is understood as a struggle in a military sense - with rules similar to the christian just war theory . because of socio-economic disparities , some muslims openly advocate violent means to achieve revolutionary ends , and some leaders declare this revolution as a holy war in order to legitimize their cause . kimball believes both that christian and muslim adherents should not speak of war but of peace and that the call for holy war is not holy . with the knowledge of when religion becomes evil , religions have a clear understanding of healthy praxis . faith , hope , and love should be the guiding spiritual compass for all religious adherents , so that in times of conflict unhealthy religious mechanisms can be averted . against secularism , kimball finds validity in religious traditions because of the time-tested wisdom and ethical standards , and he believes that religions should embrace religious diversity . with religious diversity christians have three options , exclusivism , inclusivism , and pluralism , but kimball believes each position has value if adherents from different faiths work together for the common good of humanity . finally , the middle east represents a microcosm for the world community : if peaceable solutions are not found in the arab-israeli-palestinian conflict , then the future for the world community and world religions are bleak
books	williams 's ear for dialogue , his eye for character , his exploration of love , longing and loneliness are as powerful in these short stories as they are in his plays . on occasion , the glimmer of a future work rises out of the text , such as the line , `` but the sweet bird of youth had flown from pablo gonzales ... ''
books	they are books like those written by stephen ambrose which keep the flame of my interest in reading of times and events of long ago burning . some have accused ambrose of taking too many liberties with the facts . to those i would say , bah humbug ! this book is well written and worthy of the readers time , unless , of course , you are a `` fact-checker '' , in which case the original sources , to the extent they even exist , might be more to your liking . for orginary joe 's , like me , mr. ambrose has provided a good deal of reading entertainment and information . i would strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to be transported in time and place to the high plains during the indian wars
books	before i bought the pasajes series , i was relieved to see the ( then ) mostly positive reviews . however , i really feel like the overall review score of 4.5 stars is very , very misleading . i would not , in good faith , be able to recommend this series of books for learning spanish . this series of books was very confusing and extremely difficult to work with . some of the many issues with using this series of books to learn spanish : 1 ) the concepts are not clearly explained ( they invented a `` new '' english word for one ) and the exercises are excessively complicated and do not give you enough practice with the vocabulary/concepts to feel confident using them . 2 ) frequently , new words , phrases and concepts are introduced in the middle of a lesson about something else , via a footnote , with no further explaination provided ! ! this is super frustrating and distracting ! 3 ) using this series of books is very cumbersome , the books are not well coordinated with one another , and do not appear to reinforce each other 's concepts or vocabulary . i 'm very sorry , but these books are just terrible , and 4.5 stars is not at all reflective of the quality of these books ... using this series of books has taken all the fun out of learning spanish , which i used to enjoy . if you have the option to use different books , take it
books	not a great deal of new insight here . i did learn a bit more than i knew , however , about meade 's failure to pursue at gettysburg . mr. boritt is the editor and author of one essay ; other essays are by four historians : stephen w. sears , mark e. neely , jr. , michael fellman , and john y. simon .

books	when i discovered the existence of this novel , i was enthusiastic and intrigued . unfortunately , my hopes were more or less dashed as i trundled my way through the 382 pages . kleopatra focuses on the famous queen 's early years - a period of time of which we have no record - and the intrigues that haunted and led to the demise of any semblance of a family ( something she may have compensated for in adulthood ) . what i liked : 1 ) . the spelling of kleopatra/ cleopatra with a `` k '' - it really does emphasize that hellenistic connection ; 2 ) kleopatra 's strength of character- essex 's general characterization is appropriate and it 's easy to see what kleopatra will become . although the novel is a noble attempt by karen essex , it just did n't work for me . the character of berenike as an amazon seemed a bit far-fetched . and although i loved kleopatra 's love interest ( i wo n't give away his name ! ) , i felt it was a bit far-fetched as well , almost as if essex was pressured into a love story from the publisher or something . kleopatra 's dionysian rites were also a little hard to believe , as was mohama . there were also scenes of random sex that were a bit ... unnecessary . overall , although kleopatra was a strong , believable character , she was in the minority . the novel as a sort of back-story to the queen of egypt did n't work as it was weighed down by the elements of fiction ! at least the sequel is better . for fiction that works , check out the memoirs of cleopatra by margaret george .
books	the author is a sociologist and tells of testing the opinions of two groups as to oj 's guilt . [ there was no test as to the extent of their actual knowledge ! ] you wo n't learn anything new from this book . it has a long list of books on the subject , but the author gave no ratings or summaries on them . were they all equal in quality ? the oj case received more publicity than the oklahoma city bombing or the clinton impeachment . the national association of editors and publishers has never told of the reasons for its play in the news . could it have been intended as a distraction from other news ? in may 1994 the newspapers carried stories on how north korea was ready to attack and start a war ; this was repeated weekly . in 1999 i read that president carter had been sent on a diplomatic mission to north korea ( must have been a success , since the propaganda stopped ) . could the double murders in brentwood have been well-publicized as a distraction ? is n't two murders a day the usual la statistics ? how many other waiters ( just from mezzaluna ) were murdered each year ? are murders by organized crime often solved ? the book `` killing time '' noted that restaurants and health clubs ( in la and elsewhere ) were often used a fronts for drug dealing and prostitution . if this explains the murders , you wo n't find much in this book . [ my experience is that most white americans made up their minds in june 1994 and never let the new facts interfere with their prejudgment . ]
books	i do n't really understand all the reviews about sun tzu 's work . people saying that this one or that one is closer to the original ; are there really that many experts in ancient chinese out there . how can anyone say which is the best translation unless they are personally familiar with the original , in the original chinese , and if that the case they should write their own version
books	after a quick internet search i found many reviews on amazon as well as several other sites for this book and called in an order for it at my local barnes noble that same night . dr. whitley has written this book in the most responsible and informative way without having to charge his readers for individual sessions ! in my opinion this is a must read not only for parents of underachievers but also teachers and counselors . we have always tried to stress the same learning structure and goals as the teachers . however , if at home you are on dr. whitley 's 10-step track and the teachers are still on a reward and punishment system - the parent needs to be proactive in dealing with the teachers and endeavor to obtain their support as a united front . although the steps may seem to be a cumbersome process at first read and initial implementation - the constant image of `` mr. rogers '' in the back of my mind is quite calming and thus the process can become a destressor for the parents . of course , that may not be so for those parents of hard cases where the child is at the stage where he/she is capable of `` frightening '' resistance . obviously , professional help with someone in-tuned with dr. whitley 's methods would be more advisable than his book ! to me - this book is for the parents of students in 6th grade or less - and possibly 7-8th graders . these kids still have some moldability and are n't as likely to have other serious issues that could be the source of the problem ( i.e . depression ) . for the grammatically correct - the substance of the content of the book far outweighs any such errors that are more the fault of the editors than the author ; 0 )

books	i looked for an introduction to the basics of office automation and bought this book . every example code i tried was incorrect and the examples are just all trivial . samples from the msdn was just as good as this book . if you only need a rough overview what technologies are out there , this book is ok . but for any real programming it is not very useful .
books	same ole same ole , just another way for her to make a buck . shame
books	perfectly in keeping with the imperialist ethos that he so proudly and loudly espouses , boot has foisted upon us a book that rests entirely on the labors of others . lacking even the slightest trace of shame , he plunders concepts and ideas from anyplace in the intellisphere he chooses . as a result , there 's nary a new thought nor insight to be found anywhere within these pages . even more pitiably , like a renegade third world nuclear scientist trying to `` sanitize '' his clandestinely-acquired apparatus of any markings that might possibly identify its source , boot assiduously scrubs away any subtleties and nuance that the original thoughts may have possessed . one wearies quickly of the manichaean results . and like any ideologically-driven but technically inept would-be nuclear ( or social ) engineer , he fails utterly in his attempt to enrich his raw material even minimally , succeeding only in rendering it more toxic and hazardous than it originally was . why , even the title itself has been purloined from alistair home 's 1977 underground classic , `` a savage war of peace '' ! * considering that home 's tome arrives at essentially the opposite conclusions from boot 's , this is irony most profound . it is scarcely surprising , then , that recent history has thoroughly discredited the philosophies and policies so ear-splittingly trumpeted in boot 's book , thus rendering moot any lingering interest one might have had in perusing it -- unless one wishes to take counsel for the future by ruminating upon the ozymandian ruins of boot 's espoused belief system . * recently reprinted and highly recommended !
books	this book is a place to start at best . the main part of middle eastern cook that i find enjoyable is the use of fresh produce and spices . this book calls for dried spices at times . the dishes do n't produce the food that i remember eating growing up with my family . the book is not a total loss , however . the spinach pies are acceptable . there are many other books out there that i would recommend first
books	it 's surprising to see how much the front and back cover promise only to find out how little information and substance it actually delivers . the book is very basic providing mostly very general information . the chapter on shift levers is particularly incomplete with outdated examples and few details on maintenance and repairs . the book may suffer from trying to cover both road and mountain bikes and doing a poor job with both . certainly wo n't purchase another book recommended or endorsed by bicycling magazine
books	what a chore this book was to read . if it were n't for my ocd about finishing books that i start , i would 've read the first couple of chapters and then given up . it seems like a wannabe-suspense , but it 's not . it seems like there might be a love story in it , but there 's not . it feels like there might be a creepy angle in it , but there is not . what i can gather about this book is that the author thinks she 's going to connect all these people with different circumstances and perspectives together by one tragedy . she tries to make a connection , but falls way short . read vinegar hill - that one was worth it . pass midnight champagne by
books	i clearly do not share the enthusiasm of some of the reviewers here , who will all have to forgive me for thinking that susan cooper 's `` the dark is rising '' is plain awful . this book was recommended to harry potter fans who have run out of hp books to read . i must say it was a waste of my time to read `` dark . '' never have i read a book in which no physical description is given for the hero . in this case , we are told that on his 11th birthday , an english boy named will stanton discovers he is the last of `` the old ones . '' unlike jk rowling who , in the first pages of harry potter the philosopher 's ( or sorcerer 's ) stone , provides the reader with a vivid description of harry as skinny , with an unruly mop of black hair , startlingly green eyes , and , of course , a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead , cooper does not describe will stanton at all . the result is that the reader , after having read 244 pages , still can not visualize what will looks like ! ! i also find quite annoying cooper 's approach to this good vs. evil tale . she is vague and abstract till the end as to who exactly are the old ones , and who or what exactly is the dark . as for the dark being evil , all the reader succeeds in gleaning is that the dark means cold , snow , and -- of course -- darkness . excuse me : but is this the best cooper can do ? is this what this book is about ? -- the druid pagan worldview of light vs. dark , summer vs. winter , warmth vs. cold ? what happened to the conception of evil as moral evil ?
books	this collection of poems , tho representing a fine breadth of dickenson 's works , is in final assessment a crime against the poet 's great talent . as is freely admitted in the introduction , the editor , mr. higginson , `` worked on the mechanics of the poems by smoothing out the rhymes and meter , changing the line arrangements , and rewriting the dialect of the local area . '' this is a free admission of the book 's guilt , having adulterated dickenson 's original poems in both content and form . gone are the nuances and passions that make dickenson one of the best american writers . gone are the premeditated dashed and capitalizations that add depth and intensity to the poems ' meanings . and , worst of all , gone or altered are many lines that contribute to the unique vision of the artist . as thomas h. johnson says in the introduction to `` the complete poems of emily dickenson , '' a representative mid-nineteenth century traditionalist was being asked to judge the work of a wholly new order of craftsman . . . which he was not equipped to estimate . '' do yourself a favor and avoid this text . instead , find one that is true to the original poems , one which preserves the intent and stylistic genius of the author , and one which will give you the full and lasting effect of emily dickenson
books	the title of this book should be `` photoshop finishing borders '' dave devotes too much time and effort giving tips on framing and giving borders to your images . there are a few other tips i was happy to see , however i have to give this one a definite thumbs down . i still love you dave .

books	carl hiaasen spins a tale of adventure and humor that should motivate young readers to protect wildlife and natural resources . hoot is set in the seaside town of coconut cove . the plot revolves around mother paula 's pancake house , a fictitious restaurant chain in florida about to build its 100th store on a parcel of land inhabited by families of burrowing owls . the developers know about the endangered owls and removed legal evidence of the owls from public records . unwary citizens applaud mother paula 's in coconut cove . the lone crusader for the owls is a boy nicknamed mullet fingers who lives in the backwoods dodging truant officers . he pulls up construction stakes and invents other nocturnal forays to stop development . mullet fingers enlists the help of his step sister , beatrice and new kid , roy . beatrice is a middle-school soccer queen who holds her own with the boys . roy is a level-headed kid who moves to coconut cove from montana , earning the dubious title of cowgirl . when you throw in a zany cop , a redneck construction boss , a sly businessman , a high school teacher willing to support kids acting for righteous causes and a bully whose attempts to squash roy you 've got a pretty good read !

books	this book gave me insight into german culture . it is no wonder there was a holocaust with children 's books like these . max and moritz are adventurous children and they are caught . being caught is n't enough . they are ground in a flour mill for punishment . not even that suits the miller . he feeds their remains to the ducks . it instantly reminded me of concentration camp victims being cremated and then turned into soap . this story will forever give nightmares
books	sedgwick 's character is a perverted boring loser . worst book i 've ever read -- well , almost read . talentless . end of story
books	unfortunately , for all the name brand that this book conveys , i think the cover seems to be the most intriguing part . there are much better ways for book peddling and the fact that a firm such as mckinsey allowed their name on the title of a book for the sake of a few sales , boggles this readers mind . the subject matter seems to be along the lines of the bull session with all bull and no session . no actual quantitative analysis is used throughout the book , and if anything more than an encyclopedic definition is learned from this book , i would be astounded . save some money and go search online for some basic books on beginning valuation . by the way , those giving 5 stars either ca n't read english very well or are shills for mckinsey
books	for those who endeavor to perfect fine art digital printmaking , this is the book to read . it is a `` how to '' and so much more . the book covers paper , ink , techniques , hand coloring and the practical application and intereaction of all of these variables . the book is cogently written and elegantly displayed . it is a must for anyone 's library who wishes to expand their horizons in the digital printing arena . ms. airey is a master of her craft and it shows
books	i work for a dept . with the state government and grote 's comprehensive performance management system was implemented several years ago . it works . takes the indecision and inconsistency out of perform . mgt . this text is excellent . i found that it was easy to read and to apply . we also use grote 's discipline without punishment ( dwop ) system also . i recommend his book of the same title also . excellent system .
books	very politically manipulative primer that only gives 5/8 of the story . i add 1/8 because the author does acknowlege some of the huge problems caused by unbridled global capitalism , but then quickly glosses them over basically saying that these effects are unfortunate , but that free global trade is best for everyone in the long run . there is a lot of interesting incidental information as various terms are explained , but too often this reference becomes a one-sided sermon for free trade . these are the same deceptions that robert reich started pushing under clinton . repubs kept the song going without missing a beat . most of both dem and repub reps support neoliberal policies - the rich get richer in both parties . feel free to read to learn about terms , just be aware that the author is leading you down a highly biased path
books	the author tries to bring both the biography of walsingham and a discussion of the birth of espionage together in the same book and succeeds at neither . it is a fine read if you would like a general overview of the time , but , after reading the title and reviews , i was hoping for a detailed biography of walsingham or much detail on how he created the group of people who became his information gatherers . instead , it is a general overview of walsingham 's life with references to the work that he did . there are some interesting facts that the author brings forward that the reader might not find elsewhere , but the majority of the reading is rehashed from biographies of elizabeth i . if you want details and a better understanding of walsingham the man , and his life work and actions , you will need to look elsewhere
books	this book has been golden for two of my undergrad communications classes and is turning out an invalvuable reference for my graduate level comm class , which the professor is teaching from a variety of books . it is very easy to understand and the best part is it covers all the rigorous math . it could be more rigorous with the math in some cases . still it is such a broad and complete coverage of all important topics it will serve as your comm encyclopedia .
books	how can a best-selling author like simon winchester take an event as exciting as the san francisco earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze-fest ? one answer : write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases . another : strive to break the record for most clich ? s in a single paragraph . finally : write about events in 1906 as if no one but simon winchester had ever before thought about their consequences -- thus , everything in this tedious narrative becomes about simon . simon and the raccoons ; simon on the failing american economy ; simon attempting to reproduce american accents . this is a cd set for avoiding
books	i am in the planning stages of a new business venture . i have never written a marketing plan before and needed some insight and advice as to what tactics work and how to write the plan itself . this book reads like a list of useful one-liner marketing tips and examples of how the author 's friends have used them . it is not a how to book on writing a marketing plan , and it does not go into much depth as far as how you might accomplish the things that he recommends . the most annoying part of this book is that every other page contains an advertisement for you to join some 12-week commitment mailing list that the author has created . he entices you by saying that you will receive additional tips and information for 12 weeks . hello ! ! ! mcfly ! ! ! did n't i just buy your book so that i could learn your marketing insights ? yes ! so then why do you make it seem like i just paid for the teaser information , and that the good stuff is behind the curtain that requires me to become a pawn in your marketing career ? my price of admission stops at the price of this book , and it should not seem like i 'm only getting half of the story that i paid for !
books	i wrote this review because i felt that none of the reviews so far really got the main cause of this book . this is not a book about cosmology ( as people would expect from roger penrose ) . in this tiny book , penrose summarizes his idea that the mind can not be understood by mathematical processes ( something much different from the opinion of 99,99 % of neurobiologists , such as steven pinker ) . this view is near to the nobel laureate murray gell-mann . the book is easy to understand and the ideas are very concise and its recommended for the ones that are interested in intelligence theories ( thus , the author assumes that the reader know what a neuron is and how it works ! ) . some may think this is a difficult to understand book because they did n't had in mind that this book is about penrose 's point of view on intelligence . in fact , i 'm not a physicist , nor a biologist , simply a high school student and i found the book very easy to understand , although i do not agree with penrose 's point of view . i think he forgot something very important . read it and read the other point of view and you 'll find what it is ! :
books	`` the other boleyn girl '' and `` the queen 's fool '' are two of the best books i 've ever read -- and i 've read a lot of books , especially about this period , which especially fascinates me . they were gripping to the end , and my involvement with the characters was complete -- true masterpieces . so whenever a new book by philippa gregory comes out , i buy it , hoping to have the same experience , and lately have been sorely disappointed . `` the virgin 's lover '' fell flat , and now i am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged , must give it up . one reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly -- that is always an easy guess , however it depends on the writer . anthony trollope , for instance , was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed . that may or may not be the case with gregory . i know , as a writer myself , that there are times when the work flows out , feeling almost as if it 's channeled from another source , and times when it 's harder , more mechanical . the more challenging situations are those when i 'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject . so to me , neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse . they feel forced , constructed . i 'm going back to trollope
books	. . .maybe believe your suspenders , i 'm not sure which . it seems to me that to enjoy this book , you have to suspend your suspicion of bombast and improbability . you also have to give up any qualms you might have about a protagonist who 's pretty much a pedophile and whose connection to planet earth seems pretty improbable . what you get in return are some amazing language , some great observations and a character whose zenny zest is intense but not cartoonish . much too cerebral to ever be made into a movie by any director alive now , this is a book to be enjoyed as a pure artifact of whacked-out , but craftsman-like writing

books	talk about self-absorbed ... i guess the ego and the love of self this man displays are essential to success in business ... i thought the man made some good points , but few are helpful to anyone in the real world ( or outside the newspaper business ) . nausea sets in after the second chapter . neuharth will die an old , lonely , rich man . respected by many , hated by nearly all . luckily , i did n't have to sit through this entire book . i put it down quickly
books	as crow puts it , if it had not snowed on that monday in march . the snow led to a chain of circumstances with crow bringing a homeless teenager home for dinner and a place to stay for the night . it turns out that the teenager , lloyd , was a witness to a crime , and that draws tess into the case when she connects lloyd to a news reporter . events disrupt her life as the case develops and federal agents demand that she reveal the name of the source . the story starts with a narration by crow , and alternates between crow , tess , and other characters in the story . you will get a lot more crow in this novel than in others . the story has an interesting ending , and you can wonder if lloyd will show up again . you get some information along the way about baltimore soup kitchens and the homeless , and a view of the underside of society where life is sometimes cheap
books	[ the above is an actual quote from the book ] i do n't usually read romances , but got this one at the library . i thought : thriller . hijacked plane , navy seal ... all the right stuff . and the beginning was promising . stan fixes everything , and has a human side to him that was compelling . then the plot hit the fan ! as a thriller it stunk . the highjacking was interwoven into the plot weakly , as an after thought . the romantic `` tension '' between the protagonists was forced and irritating . the dialogue is mundane . the message that horniness leads to true romantic ( sam and alyssa ) love is rubbish . the only worthwhile character was the highjacked girl , and i think it was brave of the author to not have her come out unscathed . the historic ( wwii ) componant was interesting . but overall , i kept asking who the audience is for this book . not lovers of thrillers like me -- and i wonder , do romance readers even care about a highjacked plane , or was that just getting in the way of wondering whether teri will ever tell sam that she loves him !
books	the plot is quite good . however , the style and the overall structure are somewhat weaker that in later grisham 's stories . still well worth the time
books	all throughtout this book alex delaware and his police friend milo never stop ruminating over every new fact they uncover . they have endless discussions on how a new tidbit might fit into the overall picture . the reader longs for the pair to actually do something . in the end the author walks away without even tying up all the main strings . that is really dirty pool after making the reader wade through all the yakking . i read and enjoyed several of the early alex delaware books and then quit looking for new ones , now i know why
books	i did not read the book but i did look it over carefully . i was hoping it would be a clear step by step guide to using ibd to apply the canslim method . there is so much information in the paper that it is not easy to apply all the techniques in an efficient manner . there are almost too many choices and directions possible . this book is not a step by step guide nor is it all that clear . i did find it to be unnecessarily wordy and vague . it just seems to go over the whole paper in a long winded fashion but does not get down to the nuts and bolts of `` smart investing '' as i was hoping it would . refer to william o'neil 's books for better guidance about how to invest . also , if you are a subscriber , there is a large amount of useful information on the ibd website at investors.com
books	i decided to read this on a flight to indiana from ny . i managed to complete the book on the return . it is a quick read , not a self help book , more about merton and nouwen finding their true self as well as the author 's road to becoming a jesuit . i think we all want to find our true self , but not all can and some never attempt to . martin stresses the importance of finding our true self in order to achieve happiness that comes from within

books	seven times the sun is not for everyone . it could be a springboard , offering times of the day and night where parents might want to incorporate some kind of rituals to provide their children with a stable and balanced life . but the songs , poems and traditions offered in shea darian 's book are hokey and contrived at best , cumbersome and artificial at worst . none of the other reviews indicated the religious or spiritual aspect of the book . darian is a minister , and all of the poems and songs have a subtle religious bent . true , parents should teach children to be thankful for all they have . but i 'm just thankful amazon has a customer-friendly return policy
books	this cookbook has become one of my favorites . i grew up in se texas , and once i moved away , no mexican food could compare . now i have the understanding on what differeintiates tex-mex and mexican food . the recipes are exact and delicious . i love the pictures , the stories and most of all the inspiration to cook my favorite meals ! its definately a book for any tex mex lover , i highly reccomend it . just try and sit and read it and not have your mouth water
books	you get a view into 60 's white america . the only people of color in this book are a policeman , and a caricature . i do n't have a problem with other seuss books where they are set in fantasy land and the whole world is make believe . this is set in everyday life , and i think its best left on the bookshelf , it has nothing to offer my child who has and who lives in a world where folks have brown eyes and black hair , not to mention various shades of skin colour . the rhyming is also not entertaining enough to enjoy and makeup for this one-dimensional white depiction of the world
books	this is the book that trackers and naturalists have needed for a long time . it 's finally here and it 's outstanding ! now when i take apart an owl pellet i 'll be able to determine what the owl was eating , and hence what small wildlife is abundant in that area . and when i 'm out and discover part of a skull from a mammal , bird , amphibian , or reptile , i 'll be able to find what that is too . mark elbrock has done it again : an instant classic , and a book that all trackers and naturalists should have in their collection
books	did we need a gore vidal reader ? the author is something of a long-winded blowhard , commenting at length ( and i mean length ) on every topic imaginable . in that respect he is america 's voltaire , creating reams of comment and interpretation on politics , the arts , and religion and morals . it 's hard to say where vidal fits in the framework of 20th century criticism , as he is not a conventional leftist . because of his iconoclasm , this collection can only inform the reader about gore vidal , not his times nor any intellectual or political movement . all that said , vidal is a great essayist and a droll wit . this book is much too much for the casual reader -- stick to one of his many shorter collections instead -- but for a vidal fan ( or , say , a reader of `` the nation '' ) this book is worth the time commitment
books	i have been a huge fan of michael crichton for about 25 years . however , this book is misleading and dangerous . almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem ( except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries ) . writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust - mr. crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen , and provide plenty of `` references '' to support this premise . tragically , in the long term , global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust . i hope that someday mr. crichton recognizes that , in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining , he has enormous influence on people 's thoughts and actions through his books . there is a quote : `` with great power comes great responsibility . '' but in this case it would seem : `` with great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet .
books	let me start by saying that normally i 'm a big popcorn fan . i read any article that she 's quoted in . i 've read `` the popcorn report '' at least twice and loved it . the same for `` clicking . '' great book . they 're part of my permanent library . so i was more than disappointed after the first few chapters of eveolution . i hung in there as long as i could , but the male bashing that pervades the early part of the book overwhelmed whatever golden nuggets were in its way . i just could n't tolerate reading any more . perhaps her comments about or against men are warranted in some people 's view , but i did n't see how they fit in with the intent of the book . the comments seemed gratuitous and unnecessary . so hopefully her next book will be better .
books	the worst book i 've read ( actually , i was listening to the audiobook ) . the characters are completely unbelievable and the book is so repetetive that i found myself yelling at the tape player , `` i know , i know already '' . i could n't stand the torture anymore , i did n't even finish it . i have enjoyed some of ds 's earlier work , but will not buy another
books	i do n't know why it won the national book award . this book is very slow , & amp ; very boring . where is the action ? i forced myself to finish it
books	this book provides some brief but good background to set the context then proceeds to succinctly communicate those aspects of uml one really needs to know
books	yo money . this book really puts it all into perspective . i like fish and gritts . after reading this book i can break doors and stuff . i am one with the universe . gard your gril
books	because the ideas and strategies really work ! robert allen gives more concrete information , real meat if you will in one chapter than these other so called financial authors do in an entire book . i used the ideas from robert allen to buy my first home , nothing down 5 years ago and the value of my home has escalated but ... the return on my investment on a nothing down deal is infinite ! hey ... if you do n't like robert allen , you can always read jane bryant quinn and lose money with her advice . i was talking to a guy the other day in a book store who said he lost over 75 % of his 401 ( k ) money following quinn 's `` safe '' advice . or ... you can read those tabloid websites which are around only to attract the naive and also are out to sell you their generic junk most of which is plagerized robert allen ideas
books	the text gets 5 stars for the orientation , organization , and the on-line resources for the text . it describes exactly what you would want in an applied corporate finance course . unfortunately , i have to deduct 3 stars because the text contains too many typos and smple calculations which i specifically want my students not to make . this has been frustrating for my students , as well as myself . however , i am confident that when this problem is cleaned up , the book will be among the best applied corporate finance text in the market . i strongly recommend a new , corrected edition
books	i 'm sure most people will come to fitzgerald through her novels , so i have to excuse myself as a first time reader who just happened to pick up these short stories . i still have n't decided if i enjoyed the collection , but they are unique . i thought the first story was by far the best , but after that , the quality varied widely . unlike a classic short story writer ( someone like guy de mauppassant ) , these stories have no resolution for the most part . in fact , they leave you with that feeling of listening to music and waiting to shift back into the major key . discordant is the word i 'm looking for . the settings take the reader all over the globe and across three different centuries . i suspect most would enjoy her novels more ( i am certainly heading in that direction to read them next ) , but i ca n't say since i have n't read them myself . overall , i found this collection a bit unsettling , but still well written . i 'm sure her fans will enjoy them more than i did on this first encounter
books	this book is total self-propogating hogwash . garbage . save your money , and your life , avoid this book like a big mac
books	this story is true to life living in south west and west phila . it brought back many memories and changing the names did not bother me . i really enjoyed reading about life the way it was back in the 55 to 70 era . yes this was life in phila row home .
books	when someone goes to the time and effort to expose the watertower bible company and death brokers , they get five stars from me . america is overflowing with former jehovah 's witnesses that are now living shattered lives . so , the more such books there are saturating the market , the more likely it is someone will read just the right book that will keep them from getting involved in this end of the world death-cult . or help a poor suffering jw find their way out . david reed , thank you for both of your fine books . may they be read far and wide and in between ! read i was a teenage jehovah 's witness and jehovah unmasked for two of the wildest rides ever !
books	i purchased this took and then found that it was just a reprint from several decades ag
books	i have written a lengthier review of this work elsewhere . but i did want to say to potential readers that the peggy antrobus book is a brief and welcome introduction to the global women 's movement , that as such it fills a long-felt-want , and that it is to be recommended to those new to , unfamiliar with , or who feel they should be allied with , the women 's movement . it would - it will - make an excellent text for those doing women 's studies , as to those doing social movement studies , whether globally or more locally . summarising , antrobus shows the women 's movement as political , as recognising women 's relationship to social conditions , as processal , as posed against patriarchal privilege , as beginning where and when women recognise their separateness and even their alienation , marginalisation , isolation or abandonment within wider movements for social justice or transformation . one complaint , but which is much more widely spread than in this book alone . this is the avoidance of the word `capitalism ' - even by feminists who are or were once socialists . capitalism does not even get an index reference in antrobus . capitalists , mostly after all male , white and patriarchal , call it capitalism , and are proud of it . so why can not it not be so named by feminists , who could and surely should condemn it ? this can not be solely because of their justified criticism of the archaic political-economic determinism of patriarchal socialists . so it has to be due to either a desire to be salonfähig ( acceptable in the salons within which they have been speaking , to the funders they are dependent upon ) , or a restriction of their utopia to a kinder , gentler global capitalism , a global neo-keynesian order - for which no convincing feminist case has been made . pity
books	this is a great book . well written and illustrated . this is one of the most hilarious children 's books i 've read to my child . we were laughing throughout the whole thing . i highly recommend this book to both children and adults
books	this is a colleciton of seven or so stories told by a mouse to mice about mice . it is one of those books that is simply fun to read , particularly to the wee ones at bed time . the illustrations are quite good and the nicest thing about the stories are that they are just about as much fun for the adult to read as it is for the kid . very nice illustrations , well done . recommend this one highly .
books	... in the beginnig of the 1930 's , the turks would have succeeded in making the whole world forget about the armenian genocide that took place in 1915/16 . turkey did succeed in putting pressure on the us-government in 1933 though , when a movie was supposed to be made based on this book , so the then us-government again put pressure on mgm not to make this movie . a foreign government coerced censorship in the unites states : just imagine that ! i hope the the making of the movie
books	this book has its good points . if anything , it helps you put into words what you want from a supervisor , but it is not very accurate . the online test does not account for a difference between when 2 of their options are both exactly like you , or if they do n't describe you at all . this messes up the results , and it did not describe me very well . i am not just in denial . i have taken a lot of personality type tests , like the keirsey temperment sorter and have a pretty good idea of my strengths . so , although this book is pretty good in making you understand the importance of incouraging your strengths , it still leaves you wondering about how you fit in to their terminology . as for using this book as a manager to better serve your employees , i'v seen it done and it does not necessarily work because the strengths spit out for people were not wholly accurate . the company i work for has done this , and most of the people who were shifted around to better serve their strengths ( according to this book ) are very unhappy in their new positions . your money can be spent better elsewhere . i say its only worth about $ 10
books	peck relates growing up in rural/small town vermont with a best friend who gets him into lots of trouble . humor and pranks abound in between lessons learned
books	digital photography is a fast-moving target , and this book manages to keep abreast of the latest changes with valuable information that 's vital for anyone doing digital photography . it explains all the key concepts clearly and completely , with lots of advice on getting the best photographs with any type of digital camera . i would have liked additional coverage of digital slrs , but i have found that elsewhere , and still prefer complete digital photography 's treatment of the broader topics
books	the first novel of laurell k. hamilton 's merry gentry series is not , actually , that terrible a book . it 's by far the best in a not particularly great series , actually . what made it almost impossible for me to read is that the basic premise , the set-up , is one of the most grotesquely , ridiculously stupid things i 've ever read . princess meredith nicessus has fled faerie , in fear of death at the hands of her aunt , andais , the queen of air and darkness and ruler of the unseelie court . high profile fae in this world are major public figures , like rock stars or the royal family of england . the sudden disappearance of one of the unseelie royals is a very big deal indeed . every news media in the world reports the story ... .and it never goes away . we are told solemnly that reports of princess meredith being spotted are right up there with elvis sightings . meredith 's image , the story of her mysterious disappearance , is everywhere . i mean , neolithic pygmies living in deepest africa know who meredith is , and what she looks like . meanwhile , princess meredith has disguised herself as a mortal private eye . thing is , she has n't disguised herself very much at all . her supernaturally pale skin is now humanly pale skin . her fae red hair is now human red hair . her facial features remain the same . and with everyone on the planet wondering where is princess meredith , for years on end , no one recognizes her . let me hasten to add , there is no magic involved in this , they honestly simply do n't recognize her . and the crowning touch to this masterful disguise , the name chosen for her pseudonym to hide the fact she 's actually princess meredith is ... .wait for it ... .merry gentry . jesus wept . and for years , none of her co-workers , no one who knows her , says to themself , `` hey , wait a minute , that women who looks almost exactly like princess meredith ... .merry gentry ... .princess meredith ... .oh my god , merry gentry is princess meredith ! '' nope , she 's just incognito , baby . at which point i almost threw down the book and said , `` you have got to be kidding me . '' it 's absolutely amazing to me this made it through the editing process . do laurell hamilton 's editors do anything other than rubber stamp her writing ? given her past six or eight novels , including this one , i 'm tempted to say : no , actually
books	tim russert is a great journalist and this book is a great resource for ideas and suggestions on how to be a better dad . in fact there is something in this book for everyone no matter what your relationship with your father is or was . the most precious things a father can provide are time , attention , and love . this book makes the reader sit back and appreciate the little things only you and your dad know . great work ! keep it up , tim ! -- i also watch most of tim 's tv programs .
books	interesting . i never knew there were so many varities of garlic and onions . i 'll be growing some next year
books	ugh . i did not even try to finish the book . it is full of sexual content . not recommended for anyone who likes clean literature
books	no intellectual can afford to be unacquainted with the immortal john dewey and his `` experimental school . '' who would dare criticize the education legend inseparably linked with the irreproachable rhetoric of `` progressivism ? '' i would . dewey 's conception of the child as learner assumes that the uneducated mind is essentially capable of directing its own knowledge by a spontaneous inquisitiveness stemming from nature study . this he then expects to blossom into a more expanded consideration of the various academic subjects with the teacher merely facilitating transitions and answering the child 's self-posed questions . the problems in dewey 's model begin with his science fair-meets-museum-meets-playground-meets-lecture hall school design : the model is untested on any large scale and the cost plus upkeep is prohibitively expensive . classes are small and require several specialists and non-reusable materials . as if kids did n't have enough problems with the basic skills set already , dewey would have them heavily involved in shop and home economics . even more outrageous in dewey 's model is the premise that we ought never force students to study what they do not like . their own intellectual prejudices reign supreme and by implication , teachers are discouraged from evaluating against solid standards . experienced teachers know that kids can easily hide their shortcomings even when required to study their weak subjects , and that remediation is hard to implement before they slip further behind . how could dewey 's recommendation to cater almost exclusively to the child 's intrinsic likes not further disguise and exacerbate low performance ? deweyism of course , like many other off-the-wall theories of education , denies behaviorism when it refuses to acknowledge psychological patterns in man . it depicts formulaic teaching and learning as fundamentally faulty and generalized curricula as harmful to student individuality . nothing could less representative of the quality research conducted , particularly project follow through : the great skeleton in the student-centered advocates ' closet . i 'd personally like to see dewey 's updated plan for seamlessly moving kids , who come into class with their `` natural inquisitiveness '' programmed by tv , rap music , and other pop media , into colonial american history , calculations of hyperbolic asymptotes , tennessee williams , and the `` plus-que-parfait '' tense . but of course , such leaps of interest are unnecessary if we utterly throw out the old-fashioned academic corpus along with the old-fashioned school system . 90 % of students in high schools today report that they do not feel adequately challenged . maybe the answer does n't lie in yielding to children 's lack of intellectual discipline but in tapping their potential to control that uninformed caprice . dewey 's `` progressivism '' relies upon the contradiction of allowing uneducated mind educate the teacher on its own education . from the absurdity of it , i can only conclude that sane people latch onto this school gedankenexperiment to maintain an escapist fantasy in light of dismally high drop-out rates , lowered standards , and social discord . but a radical solution is not necessarily synonymous with a good one
books	a classic ! i loved paddington as a child and i 'm thrilled to have this in our cd collection . ( i 'd even listen without the kids ! ) . stephen fry reads the stories very well
books	`` i have shooting pains in my upper left arm . '' said the pilot to brian . brian is the main character in the book hatchet . this book would be for someone who likes survival in the wilderness or even just survival . i like this book because i am into this type of writing . i think gary paulson is a very intelegant man because ... ..who could have thought of a book about a boy who his plain crashes into the canadian wilderness and ... ... ... ... .do you think he survived the wilderness ? ... ... ... he does survive the wilderness ! submitted by : peanut !
books	i found this book very helpful in outlining the importance of research & amp ; of tracking earnings estimates . mitch zacks gives a good overview of what the key factors are in determining whether a stock will perform . the zacks rank was also interesting as it looks like it has performed very well over the past years ... it seems as if the zacks rank really is accurate , and more imporartantly a successful investing method ... this is the first book i have read that has actually helped me make money , rather than just provide broad based market overviews one sometimes reads . overall good book , i would definitely recommend it
books	love letters has a very simple concept : two people reading letters they wrote to each other on separate parts of the stage . they never look at each other . but within these letters is so much humor , love , and truth that the play will carry you away with delight . i read this play as i was browsing through a bookstore . i just wanted to read the first couple of pages since i 'd heard so much about it . after page three , i did n't want to put it down . now i 'm buying it for a friend . do n't think this play is a sappy collection of gushy girl talk or even romance-novel fodder . if you have ever been in love , you will recognize parts of yourself in this . it always stays true to its well-drawn characters , which is what makes the end so heartbreakingly wonderful
books	do n't bother buying 'the wonder of girls , borrow it from a friend cause it will only make a turn around the office with many a snicker.i could n't think of a girl i grew up with including myself who needed constant reassurance or had more trouble with math than boys.i agree with the other review about we grow our own brains and make connections.infact , research shows if you give any child a chance at spatial tasks , the child improves.girls often are given dolls . , so how can a girl develope spatial ability playing with a doll ? go fig ! gurian does n't tell the reader anything about experience and environment ~ instead he is vocal about fixed brain function which of course leaves a child in a narrow subgroup.girls are all lumped into one.i would n't let your daughter read this book , 'it might give her a bad case of low self~esteem and leave her wondering about herself as a woman.gurian wants women in second place at best.teach your daughter to believe in herself not some pop psychology from a questionable author bent on messing with her success
books	the problem with this book is that it does not explain the mathematics well . the author connects the unsolvable equation with group theory but does not provide any way for the reader to understand exactly what it is that is wrong with the equation . why could the equation not be solved ? there is a reason for this fact , and the mathematical theory explains it well -- but not this book . perhaps a mathematician will write a book explaining why the 5th degree equation can not be solved in general . the reason is the subject of galois theory taught in high-level mathematics courses but explainable in a popular book ; but apparently not in this one
elec	the leather case works great . easy access to buttons , space for business cards and sd cards . ah ! ... the smell ... leather . five stars
elec	this thing worked for two days and then started cutting off songs and starting them over . we thought it was the battery going bad but a new battery did n't help . do n't buy this item . i am not even going to bother getting it replaced after reading the other reviews here
elec	i 've come to expect a decent level of quality when i buy a microsoft product but this mouse seemed like it was just some generic rebaged mouse . the main problem is when it is on a slightly uneven surface , and i mean very slight or on one that is too shiny the laser wo n't track right . i had to open the thing up and shave down part of the optics assembly becuase whoever designed it did n't test it well enough . unless your willing to do that skip this one , it is not of the same quality as the first generation microsoft optical mice . i know everyone is doing what they can to cut costs but at a certain point your robbing peter to pay paul . but then again you do get what you pay for :
elec	i needed extra space for pictures and musis downloads this was just right not too expensive and large enought to fit the purpose
elec	these actually left my screen dirtier than i started with . it left behind annoying streaks and film which i ultimately ended up having to clean off with my usual homemade solution . i suggest keeping a soft cloth with some 1:1 water and rubbing alcohol handy ; it 's cheaper and more effective
elec	i liked this charger so much that i ended up ordering a second unit . premium solid performance in addition to 3 years warranty ! i called lenmar company since the fan on the second charger did not work out of the box but guess what , they sent me another charger without hussle ! the call took about 2 minute and the replacement part was already on its way , they definetly stand by and back up their warranty . no problems with the second unit and if i ever need another one i would still buy a lenmar . the two middle charging slots supposed to work only on lenmar ppro-h batteries , one can use the slot number 1 and 4 for regular nimh batteries , it charges regular high capacity batteries to an 80 % level in less than 15 minutes , and the other ppro-h batteries in about 7-8 minutes . i did n't notice difference between my rechargeable energizer batteries and the the ppro-h batteries , but the ppro-h kind are more durable . this charger is the best in its category because it support worldwide voltage 110-240 v and the first to use neotherm® charging technology ! it 's solid and heavy duty charger , not like the cheap kind that are everywhere . i went through lots of sony chargers but you know what ? they will never see my money again ! the sony chargers are crappy and fry a lot , i have been using the msc815 since october 2005 almost daily and never once i had an issue with it
elec	when i buy flash memory , i consider price , speed , manufacturer and vendor . i got this particular memory stick for a sonyericsson w810i phone . i paid extra to get it from amazon ( no they do n't always have the best price ) . this way i am confident that i can return it if i got the wrong one or have a problem with it . the card works fine in my phone , and since i have a usb cable that hooks up to the phone , i do n't have to be concerned about removing the card to use a card reader . i have not yet experienced any problems with sandisk memory products . i am told that the sandisk sticks are faster than sony 's , but i have no way to confirm this , nor do i know if my phone ( mp3 player , camera ) is able to take advantage of faster speeds . the longest process is transferring music to the phone , and i was n't in a hurry anyway . this stick comes with an adapter to use with the older memory stick format , so i can use the 128mb stick that i replaced in my sony camcorder ( which had a 4mb stick in it . no , it 's not a typo . it 's actually a 4 megabyte memory stick )
elec	had mine for over half a year now , and after outstanding abuse it performs as well as the day i bought it . i fill it and empty it every month , rarely ever defragging it , back up my pc files and play movies right off it on my laptop . throw it in my backpack , plug and unplug it all day ( hotswaping ) , still with rarely a sign of slowdown , and it barely gets from cool to warm ever ( even when its running from inside my backpack ) . for some reason requires two usb ports on my new pc ( high speed usb2.0 ports ) when it should n't . it runs on one port at school just fine and i have switched the y cable with a regular usb cable with 50 % success . i 'd buy another one of these in a heartbeat if i ever thought the one i have would run itself out . the fact that it does n't need an external ac adapter to run on my usb1.1 laptop ports ( though it does have a hole for a non-included ac adapter ) is a blessing . i 've even used its double usb cord to run my power hog of an external cd-rom drive ( my cd-rom ac doesnt work on both sadly ) . might be luck of the draw , hd related items seem to be sometimes , and i 've yet to have to try out their customer service . but overall worth every cent spent ( especially since i was looking at a 4gb external for $ 40 before i saw this ) . nearly $ 1 a gig is a great deal .
elec	i ordered this item because it was the lowest priced of three remarkably similar devices ( all had the same description and specs ) . it worked for about 2 weeks , and then quit . a friend with the same device suggested checking the wire connection inside the cassette , which had come loose . since then it has come loose twice more , so i just do n't use it anymore . when it worked , it worked fine , but it is at best an inexpensive and temporary solution
elec	when i received my cobra nav system the cord to use it was missing and i have had to call three times and still nhave not received the cord . i contacted cobra , but i think it came from target.co
elec	tapes are cheaply priced and the picture quality offered by them is even cheaper . i say if your doing everyday recording and dont care about the quality these tapes are for you . but if you wan na save your favorite movie or show jvc or fuji is the way to go they both offer incredible picture and sound quality
elec	my mother-in-law had one of these that she uses to clean her sewing machine . i rebuild computers and thought how handy this would be and how much money i would save on air cans that are $ 5 ea . and i have bought a million of . i love this little vacuum attachment set , it works great and has a multitude of uses and has already saved me a bundle ... thanx cyber-guys ! ! ! ! you rock ! !
elec	since there is now relatively few choices for a good corded phone ( esp . with caller id ) , this phone is tops . this phone and all other at phones corded or cordless , exhibit slight feedback when talking loud or when hanging up . but no other phone out there seems to be nearly as durable . given the other choices , this is the one to get
elec	this review pertains specifically to the targus pauh217u 4 port ultra mini usb 2.0 hub . the cord is about 2.5 feet long - long enough to reach from my pc , which sits on the ground , to the top of the desk . it has a cable which is split into two usb plugs - one just to transmit data , the second to power the unit . the second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy-duty hardware , and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways ? if you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing , then it does have an input for a separate power source , which you will have to buy separately . in short , if you have an old school machine with usb ports which are inaccessible /inconvenient to use , this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk
elec	i can verify again that this is indeed 16 gauge wire . this size works very well for small-medium satellite speakers . i am using this wire with a samsung ht-q80 htib . it 's working wonderfully and i 'm getting nice crisp sound . unlike the other reviewer , my spool came fully intact . i would suggest this for anybody looking for good , cheaply priced 16 gauge speaker wire
elec	i am an it director and bought these for exercisers for my users . the outside is like a balloon , only much stronger rubber , and the inside is gel . when you squeeze them , the part that squeezes through your fingers changes color - it 's cool ! the resistance is very good and my users love them ! good product - great value and excellent quality
elec	this has got to be the easiest piece of tech i have ever set up . except for charging , it took under 5 minutes . it works as advertised . i use skypein and skypeout . my phone bill is now $ 68 a year instead of $ 384 . i also get voice mail for free with the skypein . call quality seems as good as ma bell . i was concerned with it being made by netgear , as i have had spotty luck with their products . i liked this phone so much , i just purchase another handset ( it can support up to 4 ) . this phone will pay for itself in a few months
elec	reception is only acceptable if you are seated with the headphone antenna adjusted to maximize signal strength
elec	i have owned this for about a week and wanted to share some initial thoughts . all in all pretty pleased with the purchase . it was well packaged and worked flawlessly with my ipod mini . there are five additional templates that can be used to dock different models . panicked at first because they did n't have one for the mini , but it was already installed on the model . cons : - light dimmer has three settings , but even the lowest is too bright . you can turn it off and it can be controlled by the remote . - no ability to set a permanent alarm by day of week . for example 7:00am monday to friday , no alarm on weekends . - wake to music starts and accelerates to the preset ( by you ) volume in something like 7 seconds so it is definitely not gentle . - sound is great for an alarm clock . do n't think it will compare with a mini stereo or bose sounddock . would buy again at the price
elec	besides the fact that ipod is a skinny little waste of time , let 's also mock the fact that it plays about two formats : whatever mac plays , and mp3 . woohoo . what a selection . then , we have the iaudio . it has perhaps a half inch thickness , at most , over the ipod for the standard battery model ( 20gb and 30gb anyway ; 60gb is as thick as an xl ) , though it includes so much more bang for your buck , even if some of that bang is kind of useless . but come on ; an fm radio is n't ipod standard ? almost every other portable hd player has that by now . about the only thing ipod has over iaudio is movie quality , which is , admittedly , better . but i 'm fairly basic ; i 'm buying it for my music , not to watch a bloody movie on a tiny screen . if i want to do that , i 'll buy a portable dvd player . for pictures , unless they 're ridiculously high quality , this suits just fine . but it 's not the pictures you should be interested in when buying one of these sweet players ; it 's the sound quality . which . is . marvelous . it consistantly beats ipod , it has bbe equalizer , and it not plays mp3 and aac , but wma , wav , ooc , and flac . *flac . * and if you download rockbox ( which is something you 'll have to research on your own , kids ) , you can create themes , boost your battery life , and augment your listening pleasure even further . the only drawbacks are the battery life if you do n't use playlists , skip around a lot , or play high bitrate files ( all of which are fixed rather well by rockbox ) , and the subpack . what is a subpack ? it 's a fairly good idea done badly . it 's a piece of [ ... ] plastic you can easily lose that clicks into the bottom jack of your player . in it are the power jack , line-out ( which has a bad bass roll-off problem , unfortunately ) and line-in jack , and usb port . the general idea was to make the player smaller by moving all of these jacks onto something else , but it was n't executed too well . buying a charger from [ ... ] .com solves the power jack and usb port problems nicely , and is recommended most highly . ( and did i mention recording with the built-in mic is amazing ? you can get good quality concerts with this puppy . ) plus , it 's black . ipod comes standard white . and the x5 is just better
elec	this mount is perfect ! it sticks well to the windshield , keeps the gps rock steady . it allows you to swing to driver , center and passenger 's views and back without any bending or remounting . i am very pleased ! my roadmate looks a 100 % better on this mount . i hated the mount that came with the gps . the build quality of this mount also seems to be very good . i would highly recomend this mount
elec	i do not like this item because it says it is a 16x dvd but when i put it in my burner it only reads it as 4x . something is wrong with the dvds because my burner is one of the newest out there and it is a 16x burner . so if you are looking for 16x , do not buy this one
elec	this is perfect for my ipod and keeps it totally secure while driving . great price and you get different sizes to match your car perfectly .
elec	i 've used the sd-yd250 hundreds of times over the last 2 years and it still shows no significant signs of wear . overall , the product is a five star because of its reliability and labor-saving convenience . i 've used it equally for baking bread and making pizza dough . it can also save a lot of money , provided you purchase the yeast in bulk ( for example 2lb ) . the single use yeast packages which are typically the only buying option at american supermarkets cost 20 times more per gram . particularly great savings are possible when using it to make pizza dough . this takes the tedious work out of making your own pizza , and when the dough is refrigerated for later use , it tastes even better in my opinion . like most engineered products of our age , this one is full of cute features that add little value , or cause annoyance . the yeast dispenser makes a marginal difference at best . if you use it , you ( for the most part ) create extra work for yourself because you 'll have to clean it later . the dozens of different bake modes make the product more complicated to use . they make a marginal difference in baking results . i only use the quick bake mode , which takes 2 hours to complete . let 's say you make a mistake and start the unit using the wrong settings ( easy to do given the many parameters you can set ) . you just push the reset or cancel button and start over , right ? nope , no such button exists . then unplug the unit and plug it back in , right ? nope , the engineers decided it would be a cute feature to protect against power outages , so the unit remembers where it left off . yes , but the instruction manual states that you can wait 10 minutes , and after 10 minutes it will forget , right ? nope , i tried this , too . the unit does indeed forget eventually , but it 's more than 11 minutes . if you plug it back too early , the timer resets and you have to wait again . to summarize , the hardware is excellent , and the software that controls it could hardly be dumber
elec	which was nomadland . the bono-pod is beautiful . however the inconsistency of the ipod itself is a nightmare . i 've had it just over a month now and it has started to randomly skip songs . it 's apparently a known problem with several models of the device , with no particular fix . great .
elec	i loved this printer ! ! the print quality is truly phenomenal ! i had a few issues with paper sizes , too many pieces being fed through , the rear feed slot , same as other reviewers , but looked beyond those because the prints were so wonderful . and yes , i am speaking in past tense of my wonderful printer , because it is dead at the ripe old age of 13 months ! exactly one month after the 1-yr warranty , my printer is `` unfixable '' . and hp wo n't do anything for me ... after speaking to 8 people on the phone ( only one of which i understood fully ) and 3 supervisors , they just said that i 'm sol ... so , yes , very nice printer , if it lasts
elec	horrible . the gears ingage before the tape is even loaded . you have to force the tape into the moving gears and hold down the tape door as it does not latch to stay closed on it 's own . when the tapes are rewinding it is very loud and slams the tape when it is done . you can just hear the damage being done . this model destroyed several of my daughters tapes . we really needed a rewinder to preserve our vcr and chose this model because it has an option to clean the tapes , preserving them also - this would be great providing it functioned properly . thinking maybe i got a defunct one i had amazon send out another , it too functioned in the exact same manner . nope mine was n't bad , their all bad , this model is disfunctional . i 've advised amazon not to carry units that they have become aware do not work properly . i wish amazon direct had good models to choose from , this one is not
elec	i use this subwoofer to augment my 7.1 system . it was easy to install , gives excellent response , and i could n't be more pleased .
elec	if you snap shots in burst mode , or if you want to take pictures at sporting events , fast cards like those are the way to go . almost no lag , large capacity , lifetime warranty , no complaints
elec	i purchased the docking station for potability when on the beach , at the pool or camping . i had it going nonstop for 8.5 hours on the same set of batteries it was still going strong . i would by again
elec	i am a mild audophile , and i love these headphones . they have great base response , treble , and isolation . if you listen to music on the bus on train while listening for your stop , do n't get get these ! you wo n't be able to hear a thing outside of the music
elec	i 've been a gamer for almost 20 years . this is the best mouse i 've ever owned . it is fast , accurate , well formed and constructed . i would definitely recommend it . the dpi adjustment is a nice touch . i prefer corded mice due to cordless being to heavy , this mouse is just right
elec	this is an amazing little device . i carry every word and excel file i have created in the last year on this device . how remarkable is that ? kingston really had a better profile than other thumb drives . i still have my clip cap after several months . i carry it with me daily . the really powerful potential for these devices is yet to be realised but i 'm thinking about them ! let me know how you are using yours . in addition to my data files , i downloaded applications giving my flash drive the power to accomplish tasks on its own . overall , i am happy with my drive and believe as you think of new ways to employ one you will be too . i give this device a big thumb 's up
elec	operates as described but lacks browser for use in pay for connection environments , poor battery life , need to have it fully charged every day even if you did not use it the previous day . needs mute function . volume could be louder , too . i would wait and buy next generation
elec	i bought this to work with my emac/700 . it met all of the system requirements given . what was n't said was that it was n't supported by the mac 's 10.3.9 operating system and would only work while running the toast 6 lite . in other words i could n't read or write disks from any other application on the mac . in fact it would immediately eject the disk when i quit toast . luckily , amazon took it back . they even paid the postage . unfortunately i 'm still out my hours of research and 30 mile drive getting it to the post office . additionally , having found a new `` hi tech '' way to fib , i 'm discourage from buying computer peripherals from amazon . i blame sony for this . i know amazon ca n't check out every manufacturer 's claims
elec	this is what you want , '' top of the line '' never get lost again no more spat with your friends , or others . just get the magellan and you are on your way . everyone should have one
elec	i bought this because i needed good phones without the extra bulk . they 're really lightweight , but not flimsy . they have very good sound quality . i really like the volume control on the headphones themselves . it gives me the extra level of control . all in all , a really good bang for your buck
elec	great price ! cant compare it to the more expensive `` monster cables '' but i cant imagine it being worth paying 50 dollars more for pretty much the same components
elec	maybe i 'm bias because i really like yamaha , maybe , because i have kinda ' good ears or , it 's the fat check sitting on my table from yamaha ; but what ever it is i realllllllly like this sub-woofer . i looked around a long time for the right sub , and , i like to think i got a good one here . you want power ? ok , it 's only 250 watts -not 1,000 watts like velodyne , but in my room ( 30 by 18ish with a 25 foot ceiling ) it rocks . i love music , all kinds ; loud or quiet no matter i like both , but i do like depth more than volume . however , i believe if you are going to listen to something real loud , being able to feel the music is as important as being able to here it . and let me say you can feel music if you want to . one of the things i love most about this sub is it 's range ; it can ( maybe ) reach 20 hertz . 20 hertz ! that is astounding . 20hz is the lowest frequency the human ear can hear , in fact it 's starting into the range of sounds that are felt more than heard . maybe i have good ears and maybe i do n't , but to hear rich airy low-end , and , bass notes . yes ! bass notes ! bass is not one big boomy lump of noise , it 's huge , open , grazing pasture of distinct sounds ! in short , music sounds great , even hip-hop ( which i do n't like ) sounds , well , better . also , their is no need to turn the volume way up to hear a improvement ; at very quiet levels too , you can hear good clean bass notes . but , if you do a lot of quite listening , we 're talking back ground music levels : disable the auto-on feature and manually turn it on and off , because if you happen to be listening to something quiet , even if you still can here low notes from this , it does not seem to be enough signal to keep the auto-on , well ... on . it improves movies as well , take something with a lot of dynamics like , `` the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy '' or , `` sky captain and the world of tomorrow '' there are a lot of sudden loud , and very low sounds in those movie 's and the yamaha handles it all with aplomb . with most of the controls are on the front set-up is and tweaking is made easy , and if you are wondering about the `` bass '' button : if the button is in the `` music '' position you will have to turn the volume to a higher level to shake the termites out of the walls than if its set to the `` movie '' position ( i think `` music '' is a flatter frequency response ) . as this review seems to be getting a bit long i 'll some it up : yes , there are far better subwoofers out there ( like from b ) , but i do n't have the money for those , and if someone gave me a 1,000 watt velodyne i would take it in a heartbeat- but , i would n't want to give this one up too . it 's a absolute pleasure to listen to . update : i have run some test tones on this subwoofer , and well , it can not reach 20hz . 38hz seems to be the limit for usable bass , although it is still audible to around 32hz , 20hz is a stretch . if 38hz sounds to high : their are not many movie 's or cd 's that have any sounds below 35hz . and very , very few have sound below 25hz . although it does not go as low as i would have hoped , it is still a good sub for the money , and still worth a five star review
elec	in spite of some of the poor reviews for this product , it met all of my expectations 100 % . thanks to the reviews , i understood that the unit does n't have a builtin antenna or batteries , which was helpful to know in advance . but of course the specifications never claimed those features in the first place . i was looking for a small tv to fit in the corner of my bathroom , and this unit is perfect for that . as a bonus , i can not only watch the news while i 'm getting ready for work in the morning , but i can listen to mp3 rips when i 'm in the shower . i 've owned the unit for several weeks now , use it every day , and have never had a problem playing any disk , either copy-protected movies or cds . my only concern so far has been that i did n't receive a warrantee card with the unit . i especially like the portability . it 's so easy to pick up and take anywhere , such as watching a movie in bed , and even outside ( if it 's not too bright out ) for watching sports on the patio . the speakers are adequate , considering their size , and the headphone jack lets me either use headphones or external amplified speakers if i want better quality . in summary , i have to repeat that my expectations were set before i bought the unit and i am very pleased with what i got for the price
elec	just received the flex skin and my first thought is that this is way over priced . this is a $ 5.00 piece of soft plastic that will do very little to protect the unit . it will protect against scratching , but only the areas of the unit you 're not really concerned about . the screen is totally exposed , so it can be scratched when in the unit . i 'm sure that 's so you can see the screen better , but a clear protective cover ( that can open and close ) over the screen would have been nice . anyway , at $ 25.00 this is too much to spend . i 'm ordering a leather cover with a kick stand ( which by the way you need if you want to stand it up on your desk or on a table ) for less than the price of this product . i feel i just flushed $ 25.00 bucks down the drain , hopefully you will not .
elec	this is my first plasma tv and i love it . we bought this to put the icing on the cake after having remodeled our complete house . the tv sounds great , and looks great . hdtv is stunning ! i am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this tv to anyone
elec	these buds are definitely a step up from the standard ipod buds . they stay in your ears much more easily ( without the foam black covers , which are easily lost ) , the sound is at least marginally better , and the overall construction seems to be better . you ca n't do much better for the money . however , if you 're willing to spend a little more , the jlab jbuds are the way to go . i own both the gumys and the jbuds , and the gumys are my workout pair , and i use the jbuds for everything else . but if you 're looking to spend as little as possible yet still upgrade from the ipod buds , the gumys are the way to go
elec	heres a new one ... .i have recently bought two spindles of these discs , and my computer ( imac w/ intel chip-hardly outdated ) simply doesnt recognize them-like i never put in a disc at all . the kicker is that this spring , i also ordered two spindles of these discs ( exactly the same as far as i can tell ) , from which i burned one hundred discs ( not a single faulty one ! ) for a freind overseas . i have no idea what the deal is , but have a feeling that the issue is not the quality of the discs . anyone got ideas ?
elec	if you do n't use the printer on a daily basis , these cartridges dry up only days after you stop . given that the bjc-80 is a portable printer , i only use it while traveling , which means having to buy new cartridges for every trip . a real money drain
elec	my high school is making us buy these calculators , and i want to say it is definately worth the price ! this thing works wonders , and it will do anything math-realated that you want to do ! ! ! ! ! ! i would strongly encourage you to buy this calculator . it also comes with a great unit converter and the periodic table , so it 's great for students like myself to use . buy this calculator ! ! ! ! ! you can also hook it up to your computer through a usb cable , so you can view your screen that is on the calculator , on your computer monitor , and you can back up and restore your ram memory
elec	i was looking for a tv that offered bang for buck . so i knew samsung is the way to go . except my wife was not eager as i was , but soon after buying it the planet earth hd discovery channel show was on . now i can not get my wife to stop talking about hd . we love the tv not the best tv , but best for the price . nice design and easy to use
elec	this vicks ultrasonic humidifier was thoroughly recommended by everyone when we needed a humidifer with the possible hose attachment that goes to a mask around my dad 's new tracheostomy . problem is , it puts out too much mist even at the lowest setting ! we 've tried everything including taping the hole , but it then goes from 'all ' to 'nothing ' because the small hole desired quickly coalesces water preventing steam from passing through . of course it was n't until we started mentioning it to the various rn 's that come to take care of my dad that 'everyone ' using it for the same purpose complains of the same excessive mist problem . so ... i 've resorted to making large hole cuts in the plastic tubing leading up to my dad 's mask . not a great way to do it ( and just asking to be seeded by bacteria ) , but if anyone has a better suggestion , i 'm all for it , even if it means suggesting a different humidifier..
elec	the card works great in my camera . no problems . i would recommend the product
elec	if you 're an anti-commercial radio type this tuner will probably not win you over . if however you do n't like paying a monthly charge for satellite radio and you want something more than just standard am/fm you might like this tuner . many stations in the top 50 cities have stations transmitting hd signals . the quality of hd is most amazing on quiet passages in classical music , there is no noise at all , very quiet . you do notice ! the hdt-1 is quite sensitive . it will pull in stations that other tuners wo n't , and i 'm not even talking about the hd2 streams that the stations are starting to feature . clear channel for all the bashing people do of them is doing a great job with hd . their stations sound good and most of the fm 's are doing hd2 , a few have some interesting formats not heard on most am/fm stations . i hope the get even more adventurous . my only disappointment is you need a strong signal to get hd to lock in on am or fm . i do n't believe that to be a fault of the tuner , it 's the hd system and just like fm did i 'm sure it will improve ( ask someone over 50 about fm drift ) . i give it 5 stars , it 's not perfect but for the price it 's very good and for a first generation product i do n't think it could be better than this
elec	i was very up set this walkman was a gift . it cost $ 90.00 6 months ago . it did not work right i could not get good reception at all it was complete static on all stations . i think it was defective because i always buy sony products , and they work great i still have the walkman my grandma gave me 11 years ago and it still works . buyer beware do n't buy walkmans from amazon on line . i susspect amazon may have sold me someone 's return item . although i ca n't prove it . you 'll be better off going to target or best buy . in case a refund is needed . shoppers check all your purchase 's with in a 30 day period so you wo n't get stuck with something that does not work . if i did that i could have got a full refund good luck frien
elec	its great , i bought it for my husband and he loves it . the zen micro fit perfect
elec	i 've never had a problem with these dvds . they burn and play perfectly and i 've never had a problem printing on them . what 's particularly nice about these is the printable area goes all the way to the hole . it does n't sound like a big deal but it makes for nicer looking dvds . by the way , i use an epson stylus photo r300 to print great photos and dvds
elec	i ordered this product june 21st and am now told i should receive it by oct 28th . i would n't waste my time ordering this product from amazon
elec	okay , this is not a review of the product itself . but , i strongly encourage you to consider not getting an n.e.w warranty . they are really not in the business to fix things but to make money not fixing things . if you had anything to do with the device not working ( e.g . you dropped it , forget about it they aint gon na fix/replace it whatever . ) they have a very sparce network of repair companies so if there is no one who can fix it in your area you have to ship it to them in virginia ( of course you have to pay for the shipping ! ) lastly , they tend to screw over their repair companies so in some cases they will refuse to repair items covered under an n.e.w warranty or they will take forever to repair it since they know n.e.w will take months to pay them for the work they did . if you want a nightmare for a warranty then by all means go for it
elec	i use only the best products , not refills or other manufactures as i have had problems with print cartridges that have ruined my printers . the hp ink jet cartridges are the best . i will always buy them
elec	i purchased this mp3 player thinking it was a good purchase . boy was i wrong . creative labs tend to have glitches whether it be computer hardware , software , or other products like this one . now having problems with the product is one thing , but customer service is lousy and they could give a rats [ ... ] . also when i ordered seperate batteries from their online store they mentioned after i purchased their product that it was going to be delayed for an extra month . my mp3 player stopped working after 3 months , i did get it to work again . two months later the screen told me i had hardware problems . ok , so i download the drivers that is supposed to fix the problem , no go . oh , and i forgot to mention that i am working in eastern europe at the time so it makes matters even better trying to get ahold of them via phone . save yourself some frustration and get something better . iriver maybe ? just stay away from creative lab products .
elec	every other negative review here is accurate . the video connection is horrible . the mouse runs on a delay of 1-2 seconds and is unacceptable . try the competing kensington product instead . it 's more expensive , but it works . i switched to it and all my components work just as though they were plugged in directly - in short , as advertised and expected
elec	i went from the first version of the audigy2 to this . and it did increase my performace a tiny bit . my old card was going out on me . a lot of pops and clicks and games locking up with sound skipping . have n't had any of that yet . : ) i also did n't seem to have the mb problems that were stated in first review . i have a asrock dual-vsta ( new one made for windows : vista ) . with a good stereo setup this card sounds really nice . i have a older but really nice 5.1 with 100watts for each speaker . only 4 years old , but have seen some really nice ones lately . a lot of new games coming out have intense sound now . vanguards sound has crappy options so you ca n't dumb it down and it can drag a system down , esp one using on board sound . i would give this a 4 or even 3 star rating if it included amazons rating too . [ ...
elec	did not work with my palm t|c right away . i 've not used this for any other purpose . i expect either palm or sd to release proper software to have it work with palm t|c
elec	make sure you know that these will work with your camcorder before buying . apparently , they work fine with sony camcorders ( the packet too says so ) but not with canon . also , it 's incompatible with my new panasonic camcorder too . interestingly , it was displayed as a combo offer when i bought my panasonic camcorder , which is the reason why i bought it anyway , but got duped
elec	i 've had these speakers for three years now . hissing , popping , not holding signal -- all that has been true from day 1 . and tonight , one of the speakers just would not turn on . the power supply was n't the problem -- it 's something inside the speaker box , and something that apparently can not be fixed . so my other one will be mono until i can come up with an alternative solution . oh well..
elec	i love the saitek 880 wired gamepad . so i figured the wireless would be that much better . unfortunately , my next purchase will be another wired pad to ensure no problems . there 's nothing worse than the few times i really need two gamepads that the wireless one poops out . i bought this and the batteries died . i sent saitek an e-mail and they sent me two new ones . great , they worked ! then they died soon after . hopefully their new wireless , which runs on one aa battery will not have any issues . however , this one 's a dud
elec	i doubt that they are all this bad . maybe i just got `` lucky '' . the first time i put the tape in , the motor could hardly pull the tape . when i tried to record , it played back all shaky , like a playing a record off-center on a turntable . i returned it
elec	the radio dials are not accessible when the radio is in the case -- i cut slits in the case with a knife to be able to tune the station and volume when in the case ; i ca n't believe the case did n't come this way -- and that 's just the start of the problems . the dials are fussy and it 's not easy to carry this radio , even in the case , without nudging the dial to the point you must remove it from the case -- if you have n't cut any slits in it -- and re-tune your station . in minneapolis-st. paul , wcco am radio comes in fine in a suburb 15 miles from downtown . but that station has howitzer power . forget about tuning in virtually any other am station in the city . granted , i did n't buy this to listen to fm or shortwave . it was to be an inexpensive radio to listen to baseball . with the minnesota twins having moved from wcco , that wo n't happen , as this radio is incapable of pulling in the twins ' new am radio home , or any othe am signal in the area . that 's really difficult to imagine , being other radios i own -- even chintzy giveaway promotional radios -- can pull in most any station in the metro area . if this is an example of grundig 's work , i 'd say they rely more on their brand name than their products .
elec	i bought this cd player to use in my car and it has worked beautifully ! when you consider what a fine cd player it is , and the incredibly low price , it is most certainly a best buy !
elec	i 've had this for about a week , and it seems to be working very well . the `` autoscan '' feature is very nice since i seemed to forget to switch between `` city '' and `` highway '' with my older units . the voice prompts are very clear , and the automute keeps the annoying beeps to a comfortable level . i 've had several radar detectors over the years , and this one certainly seems to be the best so far . it is also rated very highly in the amgazine articles i found
elec	first few weeks it worked , and now we really needed it when driving in remotes areas , 3 hrs away from home through a snowstorm ... ... .it gave up working and we never were able to turn it on again , ... ... .we didnot take a map , as we were sure with this navigation system we would be safe..however we felt pretty unsafe and lost very frustrating and we are very disappointed with this recently expensive magellan navigation system , and with amazon as a usually depending sourc
elec	please be aware of an important issue with this cable , even though it is recommended for the etrex gps series it will not fit their flat 4 pin connector . i had to return mine and bought one at the local rei
elec	this memory card has not given us any trouble . very reliable product . highly recommend
elec	it is very small and looks very cool.you can charge it very fast.ts sound is very good too.t has radio function too
elec	i love my 2 gb sd memory card . i use it all the time and have had no problems with it
elec	i have just up-graded to a 40 '' hd samsung 1080p tv so i had to replace my 2 yr old onkyo 601 `` great receiver '' with this 674 model mainly for the hdmi switching capabilities , set-up was a little tricky but after an hour i was ready to try the audyssey set up mic . which was very straight forward accurate boy was i blown away . this thing has such clarity separation i could n't believe the difference over my older onk.rec.i have direct tv hd-dvr panasonic 1080i dvd player via hdmi through receiver , do n't waste your money on those over priced monster cables , all of mine are 15-20 bucks from amazon . i am so pleased with my purchase i also feel this is a great value 599.00 i know their is not a better receiver out there at this price or even for 200.00 more . i would highly recommend this as the backbone to any quality home theater system . i read another review that expressed that you could n't turn it up past 60 , that is false i can crank mine up to max with with vertually no distortion
elec	i ordered the a1500 and received the a1000 . i opted not to send it back when i read the other feedback on this page . i did n't want to lose shipping costs and not get reimbursed ( as the other fellow did below ) . amazon is usually pretty good , not this time , and not on this product . if you want , you can call them at : 1.800.201.7575 ( toll free , us and canada ) 1.206.346.2992 or 1.206.266.2992 ( outside us and canada ) 1.877.586.3230 ( canada only ) uk customer service : +44.208.636.9200
elec	the write up sounds good , with many options and features , but after closer examination i had to take it back . first thing , it appears that the front dv plug was an after-thought for panasonic , it 's a rinky-dink plastic flap on the opposite side of where the main av/s plugs are located . this is often done at the last moment of production where they add a newer feature to an older designed unit , retro fitting it in wherever . the tiny `` button within a button '' toggle switch for fastforward , reverse , etc looks like it 's glued on , it wo n't last long with normal use , and it 's hard to use and in a bad place on the upper corner of the unit . the menu interface is difficult to navigate . the remote control is horrible , a real bad design for those who want to navigate quickly without looking closely at the buttons to figure out what button to push for each of the basic and most used features . you might want to pass on this one , remember the saying `` if it sounds too good to be true , it probabily is
elec	like others , i was very pleased ( initially ) with the very quick installation of this router . since i am very familiar with linksys products , working through the web utility to configure the router is a snap . i was up an running inside 5 minutes . signal strength was awesome , and i had an imac connected wirelessly with wpa security and an xp machine connected through the ethernet port . life was good ... ... ... after a few days of blissful surfing , i tried to connect a mac powerbook pro to the network . bad idea -- would not connect unless the wireless security was turned off completely ( another bad idea . ) after resetting the router a few times it made the whole system very unstable . the imac now loses it 's connection every 15 minutes or so . soooooo , once again i 'm resigned to spending fruitless hours on a tech support line to a faraway land . i purposely stayed with 802.11g because this technology is several years old and should be rock solid . i found a forum at [ ... ] that proved to me that many others are having dhcp problems with these routers . there 's no excuse for having to spend this much time setting up a very simple network ! if i had n't already tossed the box , i would be returning it for a refund .
elec	setting this unit up has been impossible , and i have not been able to use it . i have sought help of dlync website , dlynk phone support . the have not been able to work me through it . i have paid for a machine i can not use , have spent countless hours on phone and computer in trying to set it up . another person who has the same system with which i wanted to communicate has had the same problem and can not use hers
elec	after the last panasonic 4-line debacle ... .1 key failes in 6 months on all handsets yikes ! and with not having a lot of other choices on the market we were forced to buy the new edition of the panasonic phone . how bad could it be , we figured . they have to have figured out how to build a decent handset buy now . well , the handset is probably ok , but when we took it 20 feet from the base we lost signa1 . what ! ! ? called panasonic and of course customer service probably had never seen the phone suggested to unplug the battery ... for heaven 's sake . hang up , call back , next person educates me that 5.8 ghz just means clearer signal , but range is shorter . wtf ? ? ! we immediately boxed this piece of junk up and sent it back ! ! do yourself a favor , buy from a different manufacturer
elec	i love the sound quality and the way i am able to exercise and not notice that i have headphones on . the headphones do n't slide but i have had some difficulty adjusting them for a more snug fit . overall , well worth the money
elec	first , i would buy it again if i needed to . this 15 '' takes up less space on the kitchen counter , i.e. , speakers are on the bottom . second , picture and sound are excellent , i.e , clear . i would not buy this item if i wanted a true vesa mount to monitor configuration . the stand , not the monitor , has the screw holes for the vesa wall mount . not enough or clear info in the description . however , it is just as easy to turn on the counter as on the wall . if you need counter space then buy something else .
elec	i bought this card about 10 months ago to go with my nikon d70 and i 've certainly had no regrets . i have n't tried pushing the card to its limits to see how quickly it can write , but it 's been plenty fast enough to keep up with me in single-shot mode . the card is always ready when i am . downloading from the card to computer via my sandisk imagemate is fast too . i like it so much , i 'm buying a second one today
elec	while the verbatim has burned well in 100 % of my recordings they fail to operate in at least 24 different dvd players
elec	since we bought this to work with our mac , we have had nothing but problems . if asked to print one page of a document only , it freaks out , all the lights flash and has to be turned off an on again to reset it and calm it down ! have had long sessions with hp customer service on the phone and they have n't a clue . if we could have been bothered , we would have taken it back , but just live with the fact that we have to print excess pages ( at least we do recycle ) . there are various other things that also cause it to freak and flash , can never work out specifically what , we just sigh and reset it . will be looking for something else to upgrade to soon
elec	the cheapest option i found at the time but an excelent pen drive . small and with a good style
elec	my first and main complaint about this product is that it does not fit the 60gb ipod video . the 60gb model is thicker than the 30gb , and this case wo n't close around the 60gb ipod . a secondary complaint is that , though the case is sturdy and the foam lining will adequately protect a 30gb ipod from shocks , there is no protection for the screen . it 's just a hole in the case ( like the hole for using the wheel ) , and i just require more protection for my video ipod . a third ( minor ) complaint is that there 's a non-removable knob on the back of the case , for attaching the belt clip , and the knob makes it uncomfortable in a shirt or pants pocket . i 'm returning mine for all of these reasons and going with a clear hard plastic case that protects the screen , too
elec	when this jumpdrive was plugged into my windows 2000 system , the software that it loads corrupted the boot sector of my hard drive . the lexar `` technical support '' was no help at all . they told me to reinstall my system . luckily the computer repair person i hired was able to recover my data files before the os was reinstalled . lexar would not cover one dime of my repair cost . i will never purchase one of their product again
elec	no problem whatsoever with this product . it was delivered in a timely manner and worked perfectly
elec	i was excited to receive the product however it did not fit my laptop . everytime i opened the lid a popping sound would occur . turns out the rear right back panel was rubbing the lid casing . i took the laptop out and placed it back in thinking it was not properly installed , same issue . i 'm not telling anyone not to buy this product . just be cautious.. and i hope you have better luck then i did
elec	i ordered this product and it arrived 2 days later . it is genuine canon ink for a great price . i will definitely buy at amazon.com again
elec	i exchange audio letters with friends , and this stereo recorder was purchased after my sony 100 dvs died and no replacement parts were available . the sound quality is perfectly fine , though it does not pick up ambient sounds nearly as well as the old high-end machine . it comes with a stereo microphone , but it would be great if the microphone were attached to the unit -- as it is , there is a long clip-on cord . this makes it tough to do `` off-the-cuff '' recording . overall , a good value for the money . the other machine cost nearly $ 300 .
elec	4 months into it and it stops playing , jams up and i ca n't remove the cassette or any or the cd 's ... ..wo n't ever but pioneer again
elec	after doing some research and owning a cheaper shredder model , i decided to purchase this shredder . so far it was a wise decision . i have seen it elsewhere for a lot more money . i have been using it to shred up all my old and new personal documents and it is awesome . i put a kitchen garbage bag in the can and it keeps all the little paper pieces contained within the bag , and i can just keep reusing the same bag . it really is a smooth shredder and it keeps on working , no jams , etc . great buy !
elec	this antenna is too directional dependent . almost always i have to re-adjust its orientation to obtain better reception on any one channel . in addition , if you live in an apartment very close to or surrounded by adjacent apartment blocks , forget about this antenna . given most of the previous reviews , it will probably work okay if you live in small buildings
elec	i would not buy this again . the edge of the pouch impinges on the earphones connection and already wore out i set of earphones . the attachment to a belt is tricky to use , cant be done one handed and frequently unlatches when i am moving around . i am in the market for a better one
elec	it was time to get a new cordless phone and i bought this because it was on sale , and featured hard number buttons -- i find it more difficult to dial phones with soft , squishy buttons . bad decision . you ca n't hear anyone even with the volume set to maximum , the answering system is just as bad in terms of registering voices , and apparently no one can hear me . i plugged in my headset to the jack , and they can hear me , but i ca n't hear them . there is static everywhere -- you ca n't use it in range of fluorescent lights , tvs , computers , speakers , etc . in a small house with compact fluorescent bulbs everywhere , try that ! this phone is worthless and if i can return it , i will
elec	not only was this difficult to set up ( even a generally polite but sadly ill-informed technical helper from belkin was baffled regarding the simplest steps and keyphrases ) but once i finally managed to get it to work ( by simply as a last resort resetting the router with a paper clip ) it had practically no range whatsoever ; in fact , my macbook pro placed within 2 inches of the router itself only received a 75 % signal , and once the threshold of the room was crossed , the signal disappeared altogether . a free four-year old linksys router which i received with my earthlink `` home networking '' package ( and which this belkin was supposed to replace ) always worked with a full signal everywhere in the house and rarely failed , and linksys is supposed to be notoriously mac-unfriendly . anyway , i hope that there are enough ups trucks in america to handle the returns that this item -- mine included -- will require .
elec	when it worked , it did as described , but twice it stopped functioning and all data was lost . now when it is connected the computer fails to recognize it . there are many better , more reliable brands , such as the sony micro vault which i have now . nevertheless i would n't put anything on these that i did n't have backed up . these drives heat up if you leave them connected to the computer . heat will cause them to fail faster
elec	seems to be good quality . has a strong rubber scent , and no cutouts for the 4 small buttons though
elec	we 've had this printer for almost two years . i do a good amount of printing , both color b/w . while i do need to do cleanings more often with this printer , mine is not sucking up ink at an unreasonable rate at all . and it is very affordable . photos do n't always print well ... the only photo paper i have found to work well with my s530d was very the glossy trial pack that came with it when i bought it . no other photo paper has done well at all , so i suggest theirs . this is the best printer we have had in 10 years , and belive me i 've thrown my share out the window ! i can offer this advice to owners of any printers . always use the power switch on the printer to turn it on off , never use the power strip switch , or the switch from properties . for some reason doing so supposedly wastes ink ? i do n't get it , but i 've always followed that advice and this printer has been an absolute gem for us . good luck ! jeanni
elec	bought it for my wife - the pink just did n't match anything in my wardrobe ... she uses her player for the gym , and treats it somewhat rough . this `` case '' does n't protect the screen from scratches ( see most other reviews ) , but it has n't fallen off while she 's worn it , either . about 1/2 useful , really . on the other hand ... .it was cheap , right ? right ?
elec	great price for a 128mb jump drive , works perfectt for my daughters college work , such a good price i bought
elec	skull candy ear phones do look nice ... but it stops at that . within 2 seconds of putting them on , they hurt . the things are horribly uncomfortable and do not look or feel very solid . the sound was ok , but not great ... and not very loud even with the in line volume turned all the way up . yes they do look good , but head phones should sound great and be comfortable , looking good should be a bonus ... .not the entire sales point . i am very disappointed in skull candy . if you want good ear phones for a reasonable price , go for sony or senheisser . if you want a fashion accesorie ... go with skull cand
elec	this printer prints fast but the quality is poor . consumer reports rates it a best buy but i disagree . pictures come out very graney and its almost worthless to have a 2 megapixel or higher camera because the quality will not be seen with this printer . i do not recommend this printer to anyone . i bought the cannon to replace a hewlett packard deskjet 932c and it was slow but the picture quality was superior to the cannon . this purchase was a real dissapointment
elec	i bought this cable , but it suffered from an unacceptable amount of interference . faint green and purple rolling bands ruined my picture . replacing it with a shorter cable fixed the problem . do n't buy a longer cable than you need , and consider spending a little more for a higher quality wire if you need all 50 feet
elec	i totally love this cd wallet- it is not too big and not too small . the construction of this piece is very sturdy . i 've owned this for a while now and it still looks new . the color is a classic , the only problem i have with it is that the cd pockets are very flimsy other than that the exterior of this piece is unbelievable . i love it ! ! ! i actually bought another one , oh another note do be careful because the if you do n't handle the zipper with care it tends to get caught . but nothing major :
elec	i , ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you `` must '' plug in . hey guys , try it without an outside energy source , i just hope i , m not gon na fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered usb port . i have a very high end system though with wattage to sprare , but no more pci slots , damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards , why do 2 of em have to take up so much room . oh well , trade offs are a bi -- - , but a reality and 7 extra usb slots are awfully nice
elec	as a musician who 's dealt w/ opening many cd packages for many years , let me save you some money . you do n't need a special tool to open cds . just run the bottom edge of the cd against any solid , rough surface ( like a sidewalk or concrete wall ) a couple of times . the plastic wrapping will break up easy as pie , allowing you to take it off effortlessly . getting that pesky sticker that seals the top of the cd off is easy , too . again , no tools required . you 'll notice that the cd cover is `` hinged '' at the top bottom in such a way that you can easily slide the front cover off the back . it just pops in out , held in place by a little bump on one piece that fits in a hole in the other . gently pull the front cover out of its sockets at the top bottom , then bend the whole thing back , toward the top of the cd case where the sticker is affixed , so that the sticker becomes straightened out . this will let you easily pull off the sticker in one piece . ( try peeling the front cover off the sticker , rather than vice versa . ) and you 're done ! all you have to do now is just pop the front cover back into its hinges and enjoy . the whole process takes under a minute , and you 'll still have the money in your pocket that you did n't spend on an iffy cd opening tool , to buy another cd with
elec	i recently bought this thinking i could use it to upgrade my ti-86 calculator . to my surprise i heard it was incompatible with xp . i supposed the worst that could happen is that it would n't work . as soon as i recieved the cable it said to go to the website ... so i went and updated the software specific to my calculator . after the installation it asked me to restart . after the restart i immediatly recieved a blue screen of death and luckily windows xp found out it corrupted a file in the registry and fixed it but were it not for that i would have to do a format . i have not fully installed it yet as now i have started backing up everything as a just in case scenerio however i warn users that when buying this product be cautious as this is not 100 % xp compatible and may mess up your system
elec	the very first dvd player i bought was sony 's very first 5 disc dvd changer back in 1998 . it was an excellent player , but as the technology improved , it could no longer keep up . i upgraded to a single disc sony which could handle dts , and later to another single disc player which could handle progressive video . but i always missed the convenience of a 5 disc changer after having been spoiled by one at the start . at about one-third the price of that original dvd changer , this player has all the features of those previous upgrades and more while retaining the familiar functionality of my first player . it produces an excellent picture , has lots of tweakable settings , has more outputs , and is also very stylish looking . i do have a couple of nits , though . my original dvd changer had buttons on the remote which allowed me to jump directly to whichever disc i wanted . with this one , i have to press a disc skip button to cycle through all the discs until i reach the one i want . the front of the player does have direct access buttons , though . i wish i still had my old remote control as i 'm sure it would work with this unit to restore that remote functionality . second , the upscaling through hdmi produces a great image , but not really any better than leaving the image at 720x480p . in fact , upscaling will sometimes magnify some interlacing artifacts visible in the picture . it 's also unfortunate that while connected through hdmi , progressive scan can not be turned off . this should n't be an issue most of the time , but there are some video sources that might look better with it turned off . progressive settings can only be changed on the unit itself and not through the remote , but they can not be turned off when connected through hdmi . one last thing about the hdmi connection . there can sometimes be a noticeable audio sync issue when using hdmi connections and digital tvs . this is not a problem with the player , but with the way hdmi is currently implemented . this player has an audio-sync adjustment feature which should compensate for the problem . however , the audio-sync adjustment does n't work if the player is connected to a receiver via its optical digital outputs . since i need to have mine connected this way in order to enjoy 5.1 sound , the audio-sync adjustment feature is useless here . and that 's a shame . by the way , there should be no audio-sync issues if the player is connected via component , s-video , or composite outputs . there 's also a minor thing i 've found about all my sony dvd players that i have n't liked . they are unable to correctly display time remaining on certain discs , or more commonly on the special features ( documentaries , etc . ) on certain discs . i also have a cheapo philips player which has no problems displaying time remaining on those things ( even on the menu ) . it 's an improvement i 'd really like to see implemented on future players . now , despite the complaints i 've listed above , do n't get me wrong . this is still an excellent player and i really love it . i happily recommend it to anyone considering purchasing it . it really is a great value and it performs very well in most instances , and i feel it 's the best dvd player i 've ever owned . it 's just not quite perfect . in all likelihood , it 's also the last dvd player i 'll ever own as i 'll probably be buying a bluray or other hd player in a couple of years when that format war is over . but this is a great player to hold me over until then
elec	but i wo n't because i paid good money for it . as you can see from the other reviews , the speed on this thing is pathetic , almost to the point of non-functional when it comes to many small files . i had a small game on the drive , but it has tons of small files in the folder . it took over 10 minutes to delete a 10 mb folder ... makes you wonder if sandisk spent 10 minutes to test this thing . stay away.. or if you really want one , buy mine please
elec	i purchased several of these cards ... . they work great and as advertised . the d200 has a memory buffer ... but these are still fast cards ! i have used them in the d70 as well .
elec	this lavalier microphone works great and is very easy to figure out . well worth while if you 're trying to record an individual talking onto a camcorder
elec	i have had various wifi networking solutions in my home and office for several years . while some linksys units have worked for me , more often i have found them undependable . in particular , the wps54gu2 set up fine , but i almost always had to cycle the power to get it to work each time i printed . not worth the hassle
elec	buyer beware ! item was shipped with a short in the electronics and had to return . even though item clearly states that `` this is not returnable '' , i returned it anyway , only to receive more problems . stay away from this . i am refuting the credit card charges and plan on winning this one
elec	this item will not work with pixma mp810 printers . none of the photo pigments are compatpable with this unit . i am now the proud owner of a cli-8pc ink tank that is completely useless to me . i suppose it 's my fault since , when i looked at these reviews several other people had the same problem . let all other buyers be aware and not make the same mistake
elec	i purchased the adorama slinger bag after first purchasing the tamrac velocity 5 . the tamrac bag is a nice bag and can be worn as either a shoulder bag or a waist bag . unfotunately , it lacked sufficient support when worn as waist bag and did not have an attached pouch to carry a water bottle . the slinger bag addressed both of these deficiencies . when worn as a waist bag , it also uses the shoulder strap to keep the bag firmly in place which also helps to balance the weight of the bag . there are two water pouches on the slinger bag ( which is a real requirement as i live in arizona ) . the adorama slinger bag is a great travel bag . it is light weight and has great utility . i highly recommend it .
elec	i was pretty excited about this player , having read about it in runners ' world . there are a lot of problems with it , however . while it is advertised as a sports mp3 player , in a lot of respects it is n't very convenient for someone who buys it for sports . my issues are : - headphones are not at all appropriate for sports , particularly running.. they keep falling off , so i had to invest in a better pair of headphones . kind of weird since it 's supposed to be a sports player . also , i spent at least five minutes everytime untangling them before i could use them . - hard to change music while running , and it often ends up doing something i do n't want it to . you ca n't change the music without removing the mp3 player from the armband , which is a major pain and is just a function of bad design that you ca n't tell from any picture . - not easy to figure out the features of the player , such as the stopwatch , pedometer . also hard to use once you do figure it out . - software is a pain to use . - organization of songs is annoying and difficult to maneuever on player . that being said , i still use it . there are some good features : - long battery life , recharges super quick - very cool-looking player - very easy to carry around.. can slip it a pocket or a bag of any size . i would not recommend this player and if given a choice , i would not buy it again .
elec	i installed this in my new garmin nuvi gps prior to making a trip to iowa city , iowa . thought that it would provide some information useful about the city and the surrounding area . found that there is not a single location in the memory that covers anywhere in iowa . this is advertised as a north american travel guide . did they move iowa
elec	i purchased my 500 in september , it 's now january and it has never worked correctly at all . it would say that i am in russia , then lock up ( i live in nj usa ) . the first time that i sent it it , my expense , magellan support sent it back to me within 24 hours ; and it was not fixed . it still said that i was in russia and would lock up . the second time that i sent it to them , they sent me a shipping label via email . they had it in their paws for about 2 weeks . it came back said that i was in peru and then lock up . i have an old lowrance and never had a problem receiving a signal , it always locked on to my location ( albeit a little slow ) , and it worked . i 've been trying to get a new shipping label for this piece of junck now for one month . first they said that they sent it to me via email , but they said that because i have anti-spyware sw on my pc that my outlook is rejecting the label . but , i use web based email . then they said that they will send a label to me via regular mail . it 's been two and a half weeks and i have not yet received that label . they told me that they sent it out 3 days before christmas and that i did n't receive the label because of the delays in mail due to christmas and new year 's . but it 's now january . who knows , maybe i 'll be lucky and receive the label before 2008 . it 's clear to me that they have no intention of fixing this piece of junk . it was a mistake to buy it ; do n't you make the same mistake .
elec	i had an optoma h27 but felt it was lacking the brightness i liked on tv , and i heard that hd72 was much better . so i returned my h27 to costco and got the hd6800 , which is costco 's version of the hd72 . wow , `` much better '' hardly describes it ! the brightness is incredible , and the detail and colors are truly remarkable . the other night , i was trying out different dvds just to see what they looked like on the new system , and i was totally blown away . while it does upscale dvd images to look better on its system , i also bought a sony upscaling dvd player and there is a significant improvement with it with the hdmi connection . i had read that since they are both upscaling , the dvd player 's upscaling would n't be necessary , but i do find the image through the upscaling dvd the best in a side-by-side test using two sony dvd players and two dvds of the recently restored `` carousel '' using component , s-video , and hdmi at the same time , all connected to the hd72 . i saw clearer detail on faces coming from the hdmi upscaling dvd player . i was so impressed , i felt like pulling in people from the street to see it , but i fought the impulse because i do n't want to share it with anyone . with a little tweaking of the menus , new films like `` star wars iii '' and `` sin city '' showed incredible detail , and older films like `` the adventures of robin hood '' were gorgeous in their technicolor glory . i highly recommend the hd72 .
elec	i purchased 4 of these adapters ( 3 extra ) so i could hook up my macbook 's digital output for digital surround sound through my logitech speakers . the product works exactly as i expected ... great digital sound from my macbook . parts express did an excellent job of getting my order to me sooner than i expected ( ordered on a saturday , and they had the package to the courier by saturday night . ) very prompt service ... i would definitely order from them again . overall a great product from a prompt company !
elec	when this adapter first arrived , i thought it was great . the sound quality was excellent , and free of all the distortion and interference i get from using an fm transmitter-style adapter ( there are few open frequencies in the sf bay area ) . the first day , i used it for about 20 minutes total ( did n't have far to drive ) , and it worked great . the second day i had a bit farther to drive . after about 30 minutes , it quit . has n't worked again since . i did n't expect it to last forever , but less than an hour ? yes , it has a 1 year warranty : just send the unit back with a money order ( $ 6 ) to cover the return postage . of course , then you 're spending more in postage than you originally spent for the unit..
elec	when outsite temperature is around 0 celsius degrees or below , and the car and the unit it 's not yet warm enough the detector acts very strange , it gives sudden false alarm like k 1 2 3 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 55 5 0 0 0 , ku alarm 1 2 3 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 in spots where when it has normal temperature gives no alarm . and sometimes when on the highway , from nothing it gives a sudden alarm of strength 5 5 55 5 and then nothing my old cobra had no strange alarms like this one and it was smaller . the spiral coil it 's not good to short , you need a straight one maybe the scale would be better if it was from 0 to 9
elec	after using these radios two months i can say that battery life is poor.a full charge does n't hold three hours.perhaps my batteries did n't come in good condition . i did n't use them on aaa yet ... 10 mile range is not true in a normal environment , open sea or desert perhaps.product works fine while battery las
elec	this is one of the best products i have spent my money on . this speakers 'speak ' well and you will be amazed at how well they sound for that kind of size . also , the buying experience from amazon was excellent . i got mine deleivered in about 2 days . will recommend product for anyone else
elec	this notebook case is a perfect fit for the macbook , and it is compact enough to fit into larger bags . it is exactly what i was looking for
elec	this particular cam has some issues but as long as you understand how to configure it , it will blow you away . i 've heard people complain about dlink and they do have to get on the ball with tech support , autually their tech support sucks but i do n't need them . this is not a plug and play device so study the online manual carefully . when you actually learn how to use it , you wo n't buy anything else for the price . if you are tech savey , you will really enjoy the product . i have nine cams installed at three locations . using their ip software you can view upto 16 at once . the reason i 'm back , on this site , is because i need to order two more . i did have to return my first one but it was a pre-production unit and somebody forgot a timing gear . dlink sent my replacement direct . the oldest cam has worked flawlessly for a year now . one last comment , the next closent cam is a panasonic but for equal quality you will pay 50 % more with less features
elec	i like it very much , i use it in an outdoor trail camera for wild game and it hold several pictures and has been in the camera in all kinds of weather . i would buy kingston again
elec	this is actually the second rcdw500c i have purchased . the first is still working , but it has so many miles on it that i wanted to have a back-up ready when it is time to be replaced . sony electronics , in my experience , are some of the toughest in the business . the old unit may last a lot longer . i am on my third sony tv in the last thirty five years ; the second is still working for the person i finally gave it to . i am very comfortable with the technology of the rcdw500c . once learned , this unit is a dream to operate . it is user friendly , displaying all of the info the user needs for optimum use . if you have questioins , the manual is well written , and will usually enable the user to solve any problems . sony is a very reputable company . in my humble opinion , sony has been out in front of virtually all of their competitors for a long time . their products have always been a good investment for me .
elec	i saw this at the store and hoping to get it in 3 months my other reciever caught on fire and was a 19 year old yamaha rx-900
elec	this is an awesome tablet ! it has great pressure sensitivity and the pen allows for fantastic freehand drawing in programs like illustrator , photoshop and painter . the pen is a more natural feeling tool to use in these applications than a mouse . the size of the tablet allows you to get into greater detail without having to zoom in all the time .
elec	this really works is very sturdy . the problem is the bolts they give is too heavy for light home projectors . just get 14inch screws from lowes you will be ok . the manual is not good
elec	i experienced what seemed to be a common problem for many people that have purchased av cables for the ipod . i was able to get the audio but no picture was available despite following the advice of other reviewers to set my tv out signal to on . it did n't help that no manual was included in the box to assist with troubleshooting .
elec	i compared it with low cost monoprice and high cost monster cable . i picked up 10 ' cable for about $ 70.00 from amazon few months ago . it 's been working pretty well . no complains so far and i like the thinness of cable .
elec	the stick came in an excellent condition , and works perfectly . i recommend this product .
elec	i 've owned the new v.3 product for over a week and have still not been able to unlock it for use . customer service is worse than i 've ever experienced . they wo n't commit to calling me back and have suggested that someone will be working on the problem and i should continue to keep trying the unlock process until it works .
elec	this is just great . lots of storage for data files and pictures . allows me to keep my file with me where ever i go . no additonal software required , just plug it in the usb port and you have instant files , fast and easy to use . small in size but big in storage . i give it 5 stars
elec	i loved these earbuds for 5 weeks , right up until they stopped working . the wires to the ipod ( the stationary wires , not the ones that wind up ) disconnected or broke inside the retractable casing . for a while it worked if i taped the cord so it pushed the wires into the case . but quickly stopped working altogether . too bad , they 're comfortable , the sound is fine ( great on the bus ) , and the retraction works good .
elec	it 's a usb hub . all i ask is that it works . it does .
elec	i have really bad luck with head sets ( i dropped a vise on my last set , really ) these are really well built headphones , it always seems to be the mic or the volume control that goes bad , but on this head set they are all separate so if any one goes out then you still have a good head set . they can get very loud and not crack , exceptional base , and mic is very very clear . they are light but feel solid , although i have not put them to the vise test they seem you be strong . i have very big ears that is one of the reasons i bought this head set , it is very comfortable . the only thing i do n't like is that they do not block very much sound because there are holes behind the ear cups , but maybe it help keep your ears cool , maybe . i really give them 4 1/2 stars . i paid about $ 90 for them and i have no regrets . so if you want a head set to use is a relatively quit environment these are good but if not go for the sony mdr-300/mdr-400 they do n't have mics but good headphones . hope this helped , good luck
elec	there are some things i like about this , others i do n't . some people have written similar reviews , but i want to add my 2 cents . hope this helps potential buyers . likes : 1 . small , easy to use 2 . good sound quality 3 . good storage capacity for those of us who do n't have 10 million songs hanging out on our computers . 4 . some people have complained that the creative media software is hard to understand . i disagree , i found it straightforward . you can even change the titles , artists , and genres of the songs on the software before it gets transferred to the player . yes , i realize this can also be done in wmp , but sometimes you want to edit later , or you missed something earlier . 5 . replaceable battery . if it dies , you can get another one , you do n't have to send it in to the company . dislikes : 1 . the shuffle mode is annoying . it does n't go through the entire playlist on shuffle . once a song is over , it goes right back onto the potential playlist , and can sometimes get played again fairly soon after it was first played , to the exclusion of the other items on the list . i want to hear all my songs at least once before i hear repeats . 2 . the creative media center software does n't install on windows vista . 3 . this is a hard drive player , so no running with it . that 's okay though for people like me : i do n't run . it also makes it cheaper than the ipod nano , which is a flash player . 4 . the cable to recharge the battery is a usb cable that hooks directly into your computer . i do n't like this because i 'm not always around my computer , i do n't lug it with me everywhere i go . however , there are ports you can buy ( here on amazon , even ) that plug into the wall and have little usb ports , so that 's handy . 5 . not as many accessories as the ipod , but not that important . 6 . you ca n't view your photos while you are listening to music . sometimes this sucks , but if you have a camera phone , or are in an actual conversation with someone , you probably wo n't be listening to your music anyway .
elec	nothing much to report . they were as advertised and fulfilled my need
elec	the sandisk reader is impossible to misuse . it loads quickly and it 's compact shape offers most options for memory . it can be mounted vertically with attached stand for sleek ease of use or compacted flat to be discreet . i would prefer a little more weight so that it does n't move around on my desk so i 'm giving it only 4 stars . if i had to replace this reader , i would buy another sandisk
elec	pros : like a quality piano , the keys give a sense of weight , the bend in the keyboard tool some getting used too but now am typing a full speed . the mouse offers great control , though i have n't much used all the buttons that are one the form . cons : the only gotcha is if the computer freezes , there is no way to control-alt-delete . also , setting the favorite keys to non microsoft items tends to reset after updates and restarts
elec	i watch lots of show and some time wants to record good show while watching it also . if properly connected thru satelite dish to this unit and to tv , is this unit record the show while watching the same show on tv ? ( some of the units can not record while you are watching the show , tv has to be off ! ! ! ! ! !
elec	this linksys stuff simply does n't work . and do n't try getting technical support - it 's a complete waste of time . if you ca n't google the solution , just take the stuff back . the adapter install took out my tcpip stack , even for my wired connection . it took me 3 full days to figure out that i needed to remove any sign of linksys , odyssey , and funk software from the registry , then remove and reinstall the tcpip stack . linksys support could n't even get me a promised registry cleaner after 28 days , a dozen emails , and 5 separate phone calls . linksys support is just embarrassing . do n't be caught having to depend on it
elec	we had this printer less than 6 months before the cartridge slider began to jam . we would get an error message , and then would have to reset the printer and reboot the computer to get it to work for a short while . we finally ended up sending back the printer on their exchange program , after i had to ask to speak to a supervisor . ( the tech support wanted us to install a free ink cartridge when i had already installed several before contacting them ) we have had the replacement printer less than two months and are already experiencing problems again . the ink cartridge is pooling ink under the cartridge rest area in a very heavy amount , and the cartridge slider again has begun to jam . tech support has had us clean the plastic tape that pulls the cartridge carrier back and forth , and for now the unit is working . we still have n't addressed the excessive ink leak which probably has something to do with the jamming problem . i hope hp reviews comments on this website occasionally . i would like them to know i have believed in their printers and used them successfully for years , but my latest experience has caused me to reexamine that position . also , hp tech support is very difficult to deal with at best . i talked to several overseas tech support reps that spoke almost unintelligible english . i am one consumer willing to pay a little more for a product that is well supported . hp are you listening
elec	i use an i-pod mini in my car . it is in the center console where it connects to the auxillary input . i used to have to open the console to make changes or turn it on or off . the air click allows me to do all of that with the remote that i leave in a tray outside the console . it works just as it is supposed to with no problems at all . it solved my problem and i am a very satisfied customer .
elec	these verbatim discs are hands down the very worst blank media i 've ever encountered ! they 're made by cmc magnetics -- well known as the worst media manufacturer in the world . but not only are they cmc magnetics , they 're the worst of the worst of cmc magnetics ! the latest kprobe *hangs* when faced with these , forcing a hard reset . the latest nero burning rom *hangs* when faced with these , forcing a hard reset . the program continues , non-stop , to display `` waiting for media '' when i use these , and an attempt to abort hangs windows xp sp2 the same way it hangs kprobe . curiously , the media ids on these are exactly the same as that on philips lightscribe cd-r media ( they 're made by cmc magnetics as well ) . however , at least the philips are recognized by all my software and hardware , quite unlike the verbatims . that 's why i say that these verbatim are the worst of the worst from cmc magnetics . ( the philips are no prize , either , but they perform minimally well ) . the *only* thing that worked with these media are the lightscribe labeling . but what 's the point of labeling discs you ca n't even recognize , let alone burn ? i had the exact same problems with these media in both my lite-on lh-201ah burner and my nec nd-2510a burner ( the latter is universally recognized as and ideal burner for even low-quality media ) . note that verbatim had a great reputation when they sold media manufactured by taiyo yuden . but , stupidly , they chose to go ultra-cheap and turned to the dreaded cmc magnetics corp . thus , they lost all credibility ! *avoid these like the plague ! *
elec	theis is a small manuverable mouse . i especially like it for playing games since it is very quick . i had one before and i would buy another if this one quits
elec	i purchased this to work with my xbox 360 , i wanted to try this cable type with my new onkyo 7.1 home theater since i was using the old composite for sound . i heard more disortion and fuzz then if you but a soda can in a blender . i qucikly ran to best buy to buy a monster fiber optical cable it was about 50.00 dollars more . but then the sound was incredible i could n't beleive what i was hearing . i gave it two stars since the cables build was so so but not half as thick as monsters . ( maybe i got a bad model give it a shot it 's only a couple dollars )
elec	fast service and great price ! work great for about a mile or so but then i got them for shopping with my wife , she is at one end of the store and i am at the other
elec	the cord design of these is terrible . you 'll have about 6 inches from the attachment point to your left ear and about 20 inches from your right ear to your attachment point . this is especially agravating for right handed individual ( pshh hardly any of those ) . why is this an issue because it really is only not awkward if you hold your mp3 player ( or whatever ) in your left hand as the normal cord is too short . i always use the extra extended cable , which makes the entire cable maybe a foot too big for ordinary use . the sound is good for the price ( does n't compare to my normal set of headphones ) , but sporadically i feel like they are hurting my ears ( not in a physical sense ) . i have a feeling this has to do with either improper wma encoding or ( more than likely as i 've never had this before with other headphones ) improper sound design of the speakers . question is though ... would i spend the $ 30 amazon asks for them ? yes , as they are definately the best in that price range , but do n't go to best buy or circuit city to get them as the price will be too high . i expected more from sony
elec	i got mine for about 1 week ago to match with my mbp ( silver theme ) . someone mentioned about the light indications not showing as they should , or in the wrong way but mine works fine . cons : - light indicator shows exactly which usb ports are in use . - small in size - has usb port on top which comes in handy . - enough usb power- so far i did n't have to plug in the power charger yet . - comes with a usb plugged light . - comes with a extended usb cable ( for you to connect the hub to your computer ) - the usb plug is silver + transparent in color which looks kinda nice . prons : - it camed with some minor scratches on the hub 's surface although i just took it out from its sealed package carefully . those surface scratches are n't too noticeable . ( did n't want to return it and waste time money ) . - as many have already mentioned , the usb cable is connected to the hub permanently . other thoughts : - the usb cable connected the the hub is pretty thin . it 'd be a good feature ( look less noticeable ) f you treat the cable nicely , but if you are harsh on the cable , it feels like it may break . will be great if this hub has firewire ports , but i 'm very happy with this item
elec	you will appreciate this product only if you do n't have enough usb ports . in my case , i had plenty of ports , but needed an extension cable , which would help me in plugging the flash drives , whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires ( i keep my cpu , under the table ) .the only complaint i have is the the wire lenght is not long enough . overall good value for price
elec	i have some doubts that this product gets anywhere near the 400ft range it advertises , but it works nonetheless , and really considering that my router is in the basement and on the other side of the house , i figure i ought to be grateful that it works at all . i do suffer from fairly frequent disconnections , but i suspect it 's related to where i have things in the house , no so much the product . in fact , i can usually view numerous wireless connections used by my various neighbors that this device picks up . install went quickly and easily on my winxp pro sp2 machine . it 's compact and conveinient to hook up to the desktop and laptops as needed . ca n't complain , especially for the price
elec	mvsv3 gives excellent color with a vivirant and vivid feel . deffinently a high porformence wire in its class , and worth the buy
elec	never a better caluclator in existance . used it all thought calculus classes and computer science . it does everything . fast , smooth , pretty print flawlessly and more memory then a herd of elephants . even does 3d graphing excellently . spherical trig ? not a problem at all and fully graph it , slice it up and zoom in . also a few sites on hacking the ti-92 plus that you can google for anyone intrested
elec	this is my second one of this model , i burned up the first myself when we moved and i accidentially plugged the wrong transformer into it ( too much voltage = smoke ) . i found it easy to configure , set up wep keys , mac locked everything using the web-based interface . it worked great with our linksys media extender - we watch recorded tv from our media center pc on our plasma screen tv three rooms away using this device . no problems whatsoever . has n't slowed down my internet connection either . i am buying another one today to serve the mobile computer lab at work .
elec	i bought this alarm clock today ( april 7 , 2007 ) at bed , bath and beyond for $ 10 . i wish i had seen the reviews first . i bought it because of the product name , small size and variety of options . unfortunately , i realized it was n't a great buy when i brought it home ... and spent a few hours trying to keep the battery in a certain position so the clock would stay on . the connections appear to be very sensitive and the battery does n't stay in place . the clock light is pointless . it 's supposed to help you see the time in the dark , but unless you have the clock at a certain angle everything will appear blurry . actually , the screen is blurry in most positions even with the light off . as for the alarm , it 's pretty quiet . if you 're a sound sleeper or live in a noisy environment , this is not the clock for you . you 'll only hear the alarm if you sleep with it under your ear . a final note on this product : the clock has been on for almost an hour without any problems ... but only with the battery cover slightly open . if i close the cover all the way , the clock shuts off . if you want an alarm clock that will last awhile , i suggest buying something else . you get less than you pay for with this model .
elec	although these labels were functional , i was disappointed as the paper is far thinner than for similar labels i had purchased previously , and these tended to tear easily
elec	i bought a netgear wg311t wireless card to replace one from another manufacturer that had failed . first , i coudl n't get a connection to the router . two conversations with tech support in india produced the information that i had to download a new driver for windows xp-sp2 from the internet . i installed the new driver , which allowed me to connect to the router , but not reliably to the internet . a third attempt with tech support produced the suggestion that i change my web browser ( i 'm using ie ! ) instead , i bought a linksys card , which worked straight out of the box . do n't buy this product ! if you 're not convinced , go to the netgear user forum and read the horror stories there
elec	luckily , i did n't pay a penny for the motorized skipdr . as it was given to us as a `` prize . '' i have the original ( manual ) skipdr . which worked every time , and i always end up using it instead . it has more than paid for itself in repaired cd 's -- $ 20 for an entire kit at a wholesale club that came with spare sanding discs and the whole shebang . the motorized version did n't come with any deep scratch sanding pads , which i need about 25 % of the time for a badly scratched disc . most of the time the automatic sensor fails to detect that a disc is even in the machine , and wo n't start turning , so i have to squeeze it together to make it work
elec	i do n't want to rate this product , since i have n't used it . i had to , though ... i just wanted to share with everybody that this product still does not come with a charger . i received them , left them unopened upon not seeing a charger , called customer service ( they did n't do anything about the posting ) , and sent them back . a waste of time and effort and extra hassle and waiting to get the money back . do not get mislead by pictures or descriptions
elec	i hva tried alll kinds of stuff on the ipod , and this is th eonly one that got rid of all the scratches . thanks for a fantastic product
elec	i tried 4 dvds with different dvd writers and still does n't work . this stuff is junk . in addition , the manufacturer never sent the rebate . do n't buy anything from velocity
elec	i did a lot of research , not wanting to rush into anything and then regret it after seeing something else a week later . i was about to buy the newest 40 '' 720p samsung for $ 1899 ... then i stumbled upon this one at circuit city for $ 1999 and bought it on the spot ... paid about $ 50 for delivery and had it in my living room about three hours later . i 've had it a week now , and i love it . standard-definition picture quality is just okay , but are any of us buying these tvs to watch sdtv ? i get about 15 hd channels through my cable company , including all four major networks plus espn , espn2 and a couple music and movie channels . therefore , a majority of everything i watch is available in hd anyway . sdtv content still looks decent from the typical viewing distance of 10-12 feet . hd content looks awesome ( including black levels ) , and my cable provider broadcasts in only 720p . i can only imagine how good 1080p content is going to look once it becomes available . i 'm going to wait another year or two for the high-definition dvd format war to play out before i buy a blu-ray or hd-dvd player . but i 've watched standard-definition dvd on my xbox with this tv , and the picture is beautiful . i 'm sure high-definition dvd would look a little better in a side-by-side comparison , but you will not have any complaints watching standard-definition dvd on this tv . in short , this is an excellent tv , especially compared to other 1080p models in its size range . if you 're looking for something in the range of $ 2000- $ 2200 , this is the one you want . enjoy
elec	remember back in the day when cds first came out ? i do : hi-fi shops and all my male relatives proudly did these demonstrations of scatching a cd , putting it into a player , play *presto* the disc played . well , either they were making bomb-proof players back thens or the laser never got to the scratched bit of the disc because i used to have piles of discs were handled carelessly and did n't play . yes , you read correctly : i used to have stacks of unplayable discs . if you do n't read any further , you can stop at the end of this sentence : skip dr works ! here 's the short of it 1 . i have my own multination consulting firm 2 . i have worked with computer in the media and creative industries for over 20 years 3 . i dislike misleading reviews 4 . i dislike wasting my time looking for products that work 5 . i dislike being lied to wasting my money and 6 . i dislike people aggressively selling me stuff that they have little knowledge about frankly does n't work on top of that , i am impressed neither by people that trash products that do work nor people that work for certain manufacturers , create ghost profiles and trump up their employer 's products . skip doctors works . i own over 3,500 discs . out of that number , i had countless discs -- from my beloved trance planet disc , a jessye norman classical and spirituals collection , stuff by miles davis , reams of and nina simone compilations to computer program discs , backups of various creative projects , rare sacds ( superaudio cds ) and stuff that got mangled at parties or being dragged around the world before creativelabs and ipod came on the scene -- that were all unreadable . i have seen the sprays , i have seen the wipes , i have seen the low grade sandpaper product , i have tried using brasso metal polish ( a remedy recommended by a friend of mine from venezuela -- and for little scratches actually works ) and low-grade industrial solvent . hands down , short of the industrial strength polishing machines ( that handle 500 plus discs at a time and go from $ 1500 to over $ 5000 ) , skip dr ( and all its incarnations game dr / dvd dr / photo dr ) works . period . why did i only rate the product '4 stars ' ? simple : this review is about the mechanical version of the product . and i am lazy : mechanised means effort . will i buy the mechanised version ? definitely ! the product is in my shopping basket will be ordered ( when i finish writing this review to set the record straight !
elec	this 23 '' lcd hdtv has excellent image quality and looks really stylish , too . it also comes with hdmi so you can hook up the latest hd video source such as hd-dvd or blue-ray hi-def dvd players . the lcd panel itself displays vivid , evenly-lit images , and ghosting appears to not be a problem on this model . i personally ended up opting for the sharp ld-23sh1u hdtv lcd monitor because the sharp works as pc/mac monitor ( plus j started offering a $ [ ... ] rebate ) . but i think this panasonic is a great choice , too , no doubt about that
elec	i ordered this , as i have many items from amazon and had not received it after 2 months . i cancelled the order
elec	have only used it a couple of times in a month , and feel like i 've already justified the low cost . - should be fine for my intermittent use
elec	i checked previous reviews before purchasing this notebook case . what i received is what i expected . lots of compartments to store needed accessories , sturdy construction , pleasant appearance . as with a previous review , my only citicism is the shoulder strap . while it is comfortable when used , it is also fixed and can not be removed . i 've already caught it once on an airline seat arm when boarding a crowded plane . other than that , it was a good purchase for the price
elec	i have an hp pavillion ze5000 series laptop . my laptop hardly fits in this bag . the battery holder is also too small . practically unusable . very disappointed with the product
elec	got this drive a few weeks ago for an apple power mac g4 cube . the g4 cube has no fan so drive noise can be very obvious . thought the original drive was quiet until this drive was installed . this drive puts the original drive to shame with how quiet it is . unbelievable . do n't even hear the drive spinning up when the machine comes out of sleep . disc access is barely audible from a distance of 6-8 inches from the cube and is totally non-existent more than 12 inches from the cube . will not hesitate to buy seagate barracuda drives for all future machines . the 5-year warranty is a winner . highly recommend this drive for its silence , speed , cost and warranty
elec	like the other guy , not much can be said . works . works well . end of story . the only thing i would have liked to see was integration of sorts into a pci slot or something , to keep it within the case
elec	i really do n't have much to say about this book holder , not that it 's just a book holder . it 's a nice one . it does it 's job . it 's a little too expensive for just a piece of plastic . it 's strong , sturdy , and it 's big enough , even for those massive heavy textbooks , like the calculus ones . although , i would not recommend putting a dictionary or reference that 's like 6 '' thick ( even though it still may hold ) . it 's got little clamps at the bottom to prevent the page from flipping all over the place , although those tend to fall off when you move them . but that 's no big deal . just put them back on . this book holder is kind of big , and i would not put it on a small desk in the middle of a classroom , but it 's not too big . you should be able to put it almost anywhere when studying on your own time .
elec	i bought this card for my tj25 , supposedly a supported device . but the problems with this card make it nearly useless : - it comes with a web browser that does n't work . - even if the browser did work , it would only work for 30 days before you had to buy the full version . - the only downloadable browser that works with the card is eudora , which does n't do anything except display text ( you ca n't even fill in web forms with it , so webmail , searches , etc . are impossible ) . - the card is designed to work with netfront and clie mail , software that comes with internet-enabled clie devices ... obviously not what you would have if you were buying the card . these programs are not available separately . - the card would n't connect to either my wireless network or the neighbors ' , even though my powerbook has no trouble connecting to either , no additional configuration required . - while attempting to connect , the card would often stop responding , and then lock up the handheld . bottom line : if you want a web-enabled pda , buy a web-enabled pda . do n't buy this
elec	according to other reviews , this radio compares favorably with others in its price class . as a ham radio operator i can say i am very happy with the e5 . it is the best portable broadcast band radio i have ever had . it is the best portable shortwave radio i have ever had . i was particularly interested in ssb capability . it works well . i called about the noisy power supply and they are sending me the improved replacement . i use 2100 mah nimh batteries which i charge externally . i have two sets . the radio works well with these . i found that the internal antenna by itself , indoors , is not enough . i used the included wire antenna with moderately good results . but more convient is using the telescoping antenna . this antenna works , according to the manual , for fm and sw only , but i found that extending it fully , is effective in all cases . ressults using this method were similar to the wire . holding the radio and using the headset may also improve reception . hams know that the antenna is a critical part of any receiver . there are limits to what is possible in a package this size . i have not tested it with a tuned outdoor antenna . for what it is , this is a great tool . it is a convient size and easy to program and use . it more than meets my expectations . [ ...
elec	firstoff , that first review about the format capacities is outright wrong . let me explain how this works . the soundstage program that the player uses is a lot like itunes ; it has its own proprietary format that is really just mp3 with a different file extension title . when you import your mp3s into the soundstage library , it makes its own duplicate library of your music in a new directory using its 'omg ' file suffix . yes , omg . i think that 's funny , and you should too . the minidiscs themselves are essentially just cd-rws . keep this in mind . they are enjoyable cheap to buy more , they are rewritable , and they hold 80 minutes of basic cd-audio , or close to 4/5 hours of 'low bitrate ' audio , which is just compressed mp3s . the product itself is very good . i 've had one for a short while . i bought an eight-pack of disks right after i got it , and filled them with music . i have six full discs of labeled artists and find that disc-swapping of five-hour playlists is far less irritating than my old cd-player method ; cd-swapping with 70-minute albums . the controls are very simple and effective . grouping your tracks makes them easier to navigate , but you can otherwise go through all the tracks you have as if it were an audio-cd . its impeccably shockproof , and my only severe grievance is the lack of a backlight . the hold switch works fine and the unit is small and light . i got this as an alternative to harddrive mp3 jukeboxes . most mp3 players over a gig in capacity are hd storage , which is far less durable ( in my experience ) than simpler players . rather than settle for a 256 or 512 mb player that i would have to swap on my computer constantly , i got the minidisc player and can simply take other disks with me . its a solution that suited me well
elec	i bought these as a gift for my husband to watch tv late at night without disturbing me . he loves them . the sound is fine and the headphones are comfortable .
elec	i bought the archos 600 mostly for the picture- and video viewing and sharing ability - the large screen and good portability seemed ideal to share photos and videos with friends and family . the device did n't disappoint - also has coolness factor going for it with the sleek design and easy navigation . my opinion quickly changed when i ran into connectivity problems a few days into using it . while i was able to download and synchronize ( via windows media player ) easily the first couple of times the device all of a sudden was n't recognized as a usb device anymore and also froze the `` external hardware '' management function on my pc . right now i can not even connect using it simply as an external hard drive , and so far customer service at archos has not been able to help me , blaming the problem on driver issues on my pc ( seems to defy logic - works fine first and then without warning stops ) , a really frustrating experience . seems like this is along the lines of problems that another reviewer experienced , so this may not be as isolated as i thought .
elec	works well for my mac and bt enabled sony ericsson phone . other than the built in drivers for the printer in mac osx , support for options within the card and printer are non-existant . still cant figure out how to manually force a realignment of the cartridges..
elec	i bought this adapter because i could use the cable that came with ipod , ( one fewer thing to carry ) . well , about six months after opening this item , i noticed that my ipod was running on battery . one of the contacts had broken , and the device was not working anymore . i am disappointed , but should have expected that for the $ 10 i spent .
elec	the product description in january 2007 is inaccurate : batery life in the standby mode is about 20 hours , not 60 ; there is no hands free speakerphone ; if you use a standard plug-in headset , the microphone does not work ( tested two units ) . there is more : the headset is very loud ( you have to listen with the phone an inch away from your ear ) , but there is no volume adjustment ; the microphone has low sensitivity , so you find yourself yelling into it ; the clock resets itself when the power is turned off . i returned mine
elec	i 'm the consumer of sandisk usb flash drives . i have used couple of sandisk flash drives ( i.e . 512mb mini , 256mb mini ) before i bought this product . performance wise this particular product is not doing good . it 's taking long time to copy files from my computers . even it 's taking long time to delete files from this disk . so i returned to amazon and looking for mini products from sandisk . i doubt all the micro products which is having capacity more than 512mb . now i 'm planning to buy 512mb or 1gb sandisk mini usb flash drive . better buy some good one than wasting your time on this product
elec	my daughter bought this for me so i could see my grand children who live in other states . i have spent 6 days and almost $ 450 trying to get it to work . i even hired a computer repairman who charged me $ 184 and could not get it working . if it was not a gift i would send it back to get my money back . i called the help line , lots of times and usually got someone who did n't speak english very well . they would end up telling me it was a problem with the router . then i would call the router and they would tell me it is a problem with the d-link . no one wants to take responsibility for getting it working . i even went on the support page on the internet and read pages of things that could be wrong . tried them all in six days and i still do n't have it working and has cost me alot of time and `` money '' . good luck if you buy it you will need it
elec	other than the power switch is not easy to see , the most issue with this microphone is the sound quality not that good . use this microphone to record music for sure will disappoint you . even using it for church meeting recording , you would not get excited for its sound quality . if you can tolerate the size of sony ecm-ms907 , you may like the sound quality of that microphone . if you like a small lapel microphone with true voice , try the akg wms-40 wireless system . our people are much happier with the akg wireless microphone than this one .
elec	wonderful for those who type and work with computers alot -- soft and comfortable ! i have n't had any problems with carpal tunnel since ! it did n't have a nasty smell as other reviewers stated . a great buy ; saves me a lot of pain
elec	i wish i never bought this because it was not sturdy enough for textbooks . if you put a textbook on it and turn the page , it collapses and or tears the page . i would n't even use this for a notebook .
elec	this remote is so hard to use and setup . the xpress functions do n't work properly and when used switches to different inputs each time . most of the interaction with the remote is done on the touch screen so you have to look for the buttons , instead of being able to memorize their locations with your fingers . get something else
elec	have a second generation ipod ? if so , this is not the product for you . after buying my new green ipod i needed something to protect it , so i bought the `` speck nano skintight delux with holster . '' it just did n't fit it . i tried , but the only way to fix it was to cut part of it off : do n't do this . i sugest making sure the product detail includes the `` second generation .
elec	at the beginning , i really thought this is a very nice product . it does solve the cd organize and automatic storage problem for many people . however , this equipment is poorly engineered . i bought four units and all of them failed within a year for various reasons . there is no easy way to even take the discs out of the faulty units . if you ever think about move this equipment to another room , it is almost bound to fail . customer service usually take 2 days to respond . the phone service guys do not answer questions about disc stakka because they know this is a bad product and rather not to deal with it with the disappointed customer . imagining someone charges your $ 400 to organize 300+ cds for a year and then quit . i am completely pissed off .
elec	this is my second iriver product . the first one was fine but it could n't survive a trip through the washing machine . this one works well , is easy to navigate through , good sound . the case is rather cheap . the other one was rigid plastic . this case is hard to use and makes it difficult to change the batteries . the software leaves something to be desired so i use windows explorer to add songs and rearrange the order . all in all , this is a great little mp3 player
elec	these cases are amazing ! ! i love them ! ! if i ever need to replace one of my dvds i always buy memorex dvd storage cases . there the next best thing , i think to the ones that come orignal with my store bought dvds . thanks memorex !
elec	this is the worst phone that anyone could ever buy . there is constant static and clicking in the background , making it hard to hear the person on the other end . to make it worse it only has room for 10 programmable numbers and only two choices for ringtones , both obnoxiou
elec	just a heads-up for people looking to use this scanner to scan slides . you will have to unmount the slides in order to be able to scan them . given the verbiage on the box , it caught me as enough of a surprise that i returned the scanner . i 'm not ok with deception like that
elec	i have used this type of inexpensive wireless mic before and the others i tried had much better sensitivity . you have to touch this mic with your lips to be herd . there are better choices even in this price range
elec	i needed something to hold my ipod while i skateboard , and this works like a charm . never moves an inch . can get a litle uncomfortable if sweating a lot
elec	good sound and comfortable for the price . like the fact that the cord is on one side and does not go around you neck
elec	i was ( wrongly ) advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from voodoo . be sure your computer is supported , because targus tech wo n't give you any info about voltage , amperage or wattage on this thing , so you ca n't safely maake it work with an unsupported computer . so amazon , as usual , graciously took it back . love amazon . i just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky i did n't keep it and try to make it work
elec	the card works and produces a reasonable image , but the `` catalyst '' software used to drive the card is lacking/buggy . to make work , i had to disable the scsi cd burner in the system ( or the software would hang for several minutes before working ) . the sofware is slow to open/respond , beyond that the ability to size the tv window is very limited . this card replaced a standard tv card in my system that i bought for $ 25 . i used the old card more because it would open quickly and i could resize the window to be small ( non intrusive ) while i was working on other things . on the plus size , i can expand the hdtv card to larger windows while retaining a good image
elec	this transmitter requires me to remove the case from my ipod 5g . even with the case removed the device does n't fit snugly and works it way loose as i am driving . the sound is fair even though the area where i live has many unused stations . i would think it would sound much better than it does . poor quality product ; has too many flaws to justify the high price . i 'm very disappointed and i 'm returning it
elec	i use this in conjunction with the sandisk ultra ii 2.0 gb compact flash card . i like it , but the flash card does n't slide in easily . sometimes it get stuck halfway , as if the unit has not been designed properly and the sliders for the card offer enough give to slide the card to the left or right of the pins . to add insult to injury , both the reader and flash card are manufactured by sandisk . therefore , they should work seamlessly together , but pathetically , they do n't . i 'd much rather pay more for a reader that worked great , rather than save a few dollars for a reader that makes you work every time you use the thing . for comparison , my camera accepts the card perfectly . there is no give at all , but instead is an effortless process . not a quality reader . other than that , it works as expected . surprisingly , the reader does n't topple over as easily as i thought it would . it stands vertically and looks like it might fall over when trying to slide the card in . sliding the card in a 2 handed process , so one hand holds the unit while the other slides it in . removing the card is extremely easy . that 's a one-handed process . `` eject '' the card from the pc 's drive and then remove it . data transfer from the card to pc is very quick . overall , i 'm glad to have it , but it 's an annoyance to use it . i hate the card getting stuck halfway in the reader
elec	the toshibamd14f52 arrived defective . some channels would not function properly - ghost images and snow on screen . we have direct connect cable with 5 other tvs that work perfectly . toshiba customer service was horrible to deal with ; they were evasive , would not listen to my explanations but insisted on telling me to try what i had already tried to make the tv work . they also told me to call my cable company for help . finally , after talking to several different unhelpful and unfriendly toshiba people , i was referred to a tv repair agent for toshiba that turned out to be unsavory , dishonest , given to lying and refusing to demonstrate he had fixed the tv as he claimed . he refused to plug it in to show it worked . well , as i suspected , when i got home and tried the tv , he had left the tv as non-functional as it was when he received it , but insisted it was fixed . he told me to buy an external tv antenna and not use my cable tv ! i will never buy another toshiba tv again
elec	this is extremely high quality photo paper best used in canon photo printers . the 13 '' by 19 '' is used best with the canon i9000 printer series , with a web of 13 '' . this paper resists moisture damage and has archival quality .
elec	i am very pleased with this item . it is fits comfortably , holds my cd player snugly and has room for my id , keys , extra batteries cd 's
elec	i bought this mouse for my fiancee about three months ago and she has not complained once . she uses it extensively in her office and reports that it is accurate , comfortable , and looks sharp
elec	i bought these thinking they were a good deal but now i have to agree with some of the other reviewers . i bought 24 of these and one year later i have four left that will take any sort of charge . the ones that died maybe had six recharges on them each . i also have several high end chargers that do n't want anything to do with the ones that died . on the bright side i have several lenmar dlcrv3 batteries for my digital camera and they have been a+ after 2+ years
elec	the mounting kit installed easily and is holding a pair of bose 151 speakers . it works well for what i need
elec	how can you go wrong with a price so low . they 're good for both parents and kids to use . not to mention they 're easy for young kids to operate ! keep in touch
elec	they are everything the other reviewers said they were , and i , too , ca n't wait until the printing is darker and in color ! wish it did n't take so long to print and hope the darker images and color only require an upgrade
elec	the item works as i expected . i received within the tiem offered by the seller . i 'll buy again from this merchant
elec	once again i 'm amazed at how the reviews were so highly in favor of this product . these are terribly uncomfortable ( for my ears ) and do n't really provide that great of listening experience . the frequency response seems muted until you use the largest possible `` surrounds '' , and then they become distractingly uncomfortable . but of course , this is just my experience , your mileage may vary , as they say . personally , i found my apple ipod 'phones to be better
elec	either the item is faulty or my television is too old but it didnt work for me . i needed to use the component from vga to avoid taking up my s video and dvi openings on ym video card and the television never picked up the signal . instead if you have a component open for video just use the s video converter not from this item .
elec	this one of those products your girlfriend wonders why you are wasting your money on , that turns out to make life so much easier . it has allowed me to leave my ipod in my backpack on my way to work , and go through security to get into work , all without having to open my bag . the remote has a velcro strap that i use to attach to the shoulder strap of my back pack . i am able to start and stop tunes and change the volume without needing to pull the ipod out . my only complaint was that the headphone jack should have a strap or something to help keep the headphones in all the way and the device could also have a strap . as the device is made for active people it would be nice to know that everything would stay connected , because when things do come undone , you do have to open your bag and put it all back together and that defeats the point of having the air click .
elec	the radio dials are not accessible when the radio is in the case -- i cut slits in the case with a knife to be able to tune the station and volume when in the case ; i ca n't believe the case did n't come this way -- and that 's just the start of the problems . the dials are fussy and it 's not easy to carry this radio , even in the case , without nudging the dial to the point you must remove it from the case -- if you have n't cut any slits in it -- and re-tune your station . in minneapolis-st. paul , wcco am radio comes in fine in a suburb 15 miles from downtown . but that station has howitzer power . forget about tuning in virtually any other am station in the city . granted , i did n't buy this to listen to fm or shortwave . it was to be an inexpensive radio to listen to baseball . with the minnesota twins having moved from wcco , that wo n't happen , as this radio is incapable of pulling in the twins ' new am radio home , or any othe am signal in the area . that 's really difficult to imagine , being other radios i own -- even chintzy giveaway promotional radios -- can pull in most any station in the metro area . if this is an example of grundig 's work , i 'd say they rely more on their brand name than their products .
elec	i bought my monitor yesterday and found to have a buzzing sound at lower brightness ( & lt ; 100 % ) . just scheduled an exchange lcd
elec	actually , i loved the philips acoustic edge , an earlier and internal sound card , but it did not like my older dual-processor system . because of that i was a bit skittish about using their current internal card with a processor that uses hyper-threading - which windows treats as dual processors . i bought the aurelium instead . i love this thing ! i am a bit of an audiophile , and this sound card is just perfect . with my klipsch computer speakers , it makes a perfect combination
elec	i already test a loot of mobo ... asus , msi ( my last was k8n diamond ) , and others ... but this board looks like no other , and realy works ! ! ! for gamers is the ultimate board ... i really recomend it !
elec	i bought this dvd recorder because it was one of the few that recorded onto virtually every format . plus , it 's a sony , and i 've never had any problems with sony before . the recorder works intermittently . it recorded a few hours worth of shows , then it would corrupt the disk , rendering it useles ( abaout 2/3 of the time ) . i thought maybe it was the media , so i bought sony media ( this time it only corrupted the disk 1/3 of the time ) . i sent the product to sony for repair and `` they could not duplicate the issue '' so they sent it back . the sony repair service center is located in south texas , where the labor is cheap and it shows . i got my unit back , and on the 2nd disk , it failed ! ! now the door is jammed and i ca n't take the dvd out . do n't buy this product . i 'm buying samsung from now on
elec	price is excellent . no problems but i falls below a 5 star due to product lacking higher quality materials .
elec	i did n't want to fork over 500 for a bose or boston acoustics , or even 350 for a cambridge soundworks , and then i found this little gem , for about 175 + shipping . i 've had it for a few days , and so far i am impressed . the sx functions are very intuitive , easy to set the time and both alarms . i thought it was extremely innovative to have the button that sets the time located inside the cd player compartment , no more accidentally changing the time instead of the alarm ! the alarm buttons themselves will illuminate when they are activated , which is great . the buttons themselves have a nice click when you press them , and the cd , am/fm tuner , and aux buttons will glow when they are active . the volume control and tuner knobs are recessed , but this keeps the player from having any unsightly bulges i suppose . the snooze/sleep button is a good size . the sleep function can be toggled for 90 , 60 , or 30 minutes . the range of the speakers is great when you consider the size of the sx . the speakers measure about 2.5 inches , and with the volume turned up , you can definitely feel the air being pushed out of the bottom of the unit . i like that it has adjustable bass and treble , which can vary from -5 to +5 . i have the bass set to +3 and treble to +2 and it sounds great . it does n't have the range of say a home entertainment system , but definitely rivals my sony bookshelf system . the mp3 player on the sx could be better , but is adequate . during playback , the lcd will scroll to display the filename , title , artist , and track . it can be programmed for up to 64 tracks , but i have n't had the time or patience for this . instead , i just numbered the mp3 tracks in the order i wanted before burning them to the cd-rom . the repeat function works well , and you can choose either to repeat one track , repeat all tracks , or repeat just one folder . however , the shuffle function is rather limited , as it has only one setting which is to randomly play an mp3 from any of the folders ( resulting in less than desired combinations of music ) , and it stop playing music after each song from all the folders has been played once . one of the things i looked for in a clock radio is an auxilliary input mini-jack , and it also has a jack for headphones . i have my laptop on my nightstand right now , and it playing mp3s on winamp sound great plugged into the sx . there are only 2 levels of brightness for the backlit lcd . the default level can not be changed or dimmed , and is rather bright in a dark room.. it will make everything glow . takes a little while to get used to , but is not say brighter than a typical nightlight i guess . it is a bit hard to read at night because the numbers are so small , and the brightness of the lcd can kind of drown out the analog display , but then again i wear glasses so i suppose i have nothing to blame besides my bad eyes . when the radio or cd player is in operation , the dial becomes significantly brighter but it can be toggled to the lower/default level with the dimmer button on the remote control . one other thing about the unit was the lack of a battery backup , and you will notice this is the case with many japanese units , including the sony clock radios . i guess the power grid in japan is really stable , so they do n't have use for this , but still , it would be nice if there was an option for a backup 9 volt battery . on the other hand , i was informed by teac tech support that the unit does contain a capcitor which will retain the time and alarm for `` up to 3 hours '' . i have n't had the time to test the maximum threshold , but i can say that i did unplug the clock for about a minute , and when i plugged it back in , sure enough the time and alarms were still correct . overall i am really impressed by this unit . the only thing that could be better is if the mp3 player shuffle had a few more options , but i guess this is ok as many i have seen mp3 clock radios without any shuffle function at all ! also , i wish the lcd backlight could be adjusted a little more . it is a bit pricey at just under 200 , but i have heard many clock radios , and you would have to spend 350+++ to get anywhere near the sound quality of the teac sx
elec	the unit was 20ft from the receiver , in the same room , in direct view of eachother ... tivo would n't connect
elec	the 3m privacy filter does not work unless you are at a 50 degree angle or more to the screen . otherwise you can see the screen . you can see the screen clearly from any distance if you are directly behind it . all the filter does is make the screen a little darker . do n't waste your money
elec	these cards only work with camera that supports the write acceleration ! ! otherwise the speed is no different from a 12x card . there is nothing wrong with the card in terms of capacity or quality . i have given a single star rating coz it should clearly state that the 80x speed is only possible with cameras supporting write acceleration ! ! very few camera support this technology and one can easily get the same capacity ( 12x ) at 1/4 the mentioned price . so why pay more if your camera does not support this technology !
elec	can capture analog video and produce cd-rom 's but i expected the ability to produce dvd
elec	i ordered the 2-year service plan on may 1st , this day ( july 31st ) , i still have not recievied it . i have contacted them a number of times , and still nothing . do not buy from this company
elec	i have two ni-mh chargers and sony batteries wo n't charge in them . they probably use some proprietary technology to prevent using other brand chargers . they force you to buy their own non-standard charger that probably wo n't again charge other brand batteries . and of course this is not mentioned anywhere . no wonder these batteries are the cheapest . do n't waste your money or support sony 's attempt to bring non-standard products into a standardized market . soon we have to carry bunch of chargers instead of the good old times when just one was enough
elec	this is a good product . not as good as an mp3 player with internal memory , as it is bulkier . but , it is great for the price . the only drawback is , it is somewhat larger than a player with internal memory . running with it can be uncomfortable at times ... if you are a runner , you may prefer a smaller mp3 player , one you can put in your shorts pocket ...
elec	i 'm very happy with this desktop system . great sound , great reception , great price
elec	this is the same unit that hp sells , but has lite on do its support . great unit for about a month . support is not good .
elec	after purchase they want the buyer to call for the service agreement . of course you want a hard copy , that is why you bought it . just do it .
elec	i purchased this microphone for my 6 year old daughter to replace a microphone to her karaoke machine that the dog chewed up . this mic was inexpensive and works fine so far . we have n't had it very long so it has not really been put to the test of time
elec	i was very pleased with the improvement of picture quality ( colour and clarity ) over the standard playstation cable . anyone with an s-video input should consider making this simple upgrade
elec	viewing the internet this monitor was great . when i tried to play a movie , dvd disc , mpeg , avi , anything . the picture was terrible . very bad pixilation . i was told it might be the video card . i bought a new card xfx geforce 7600 gs , for another $ 150.00 . same quality on films . i tried latest driver from xfx , from nvidia , etc . changed screen resolutions , everything you could think of , i tried . the picture for viewing movies was terrible . i hooked my old 15 inch monitor back up , the picture quality for movies is great . i have returned this monitor , now i have to wait for a refund before i will try a different monitor . the black light bleed is very bad . if you watch films on your monitor , you ca n't help but notice it . ps . amazon was great about refunding shipping . amazon is the best online store there is
elec	for $ 99 this should be a much better remote . if you watch movies in the dark , you have to use the glow button , guess what , you will have to replace the batteries once a month at least . also , logitech has over simplifed the remote . you ca n't program individual buttons you have to use their program that only allows you to program devices and not the remote directly . if you have to go into the device menu a lot you will not be able to control the volume unless you switch to the device that controls volume . why not have an option to program each button period ... but the remote is useless now because of the low battery life . do not buy this unless you want to buy batteries every month . ridiculous . only remote i have ever had like this
elec	i did a bunch of research before i bought the a2 . the things that sold me on it were : 1 . battery life . 2 . it 's got a voice recorder encodes direct to mp3 3 . i love the fact that it 's `` folder view '' , all my music on my pc is organized by artist then album anyway , so it 's just copy and paste to get it onto the a2.which leads to ... ... ... ... ... .. 4 . just copy mp3 's avi 's on there like a removable usb drive . 5 . a/v out to tv is cool . 6 . a/v in to record video is a nice extra . so far it 's played every avi i 've thrown at it . i 've got 15gb of music on there and just let it random play the whole lot i use the a2 mostly when driving . i got a nice fm transmitter that powers off the cig socket , sound quality is pretty good . only problem i have is that i have to carry the a2 in the house at night for fear of it getting stolen out of the car ! i also invested in the silicon cover from zcover-it comes with a plastic screen protector and is perfect for when my 2 yr old wants to watch one of his movies on there ( the a2 makes for a great pacifier ! ) mine came with the latest firmware on there so there was no need to upgrade . i 'm very happy with the a2 and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for am honest to goodness media player and has no need for subscription services or any other force fed crap .
elec	i 've owned 2 sets of these types of phone systems . a ge set and a 2.4 gig uniden set . this is by far the best . actually , it 's perfect . no noise on the line at all . everything just works perfectly . only one caution . this particular model does not have an answering machine . i was moving too fast when i bought and thought that it did . if you want an answering machine to come with , make sure you buy the right model . i 'm totally sold on the dect 6.0 ! ! ! ! buy it . you wo n't regret it .
elec	the product shipped immediately , a new dell ac adapter from cable4less . i am extremely happy with the company and the charger 's performance as i needed a second one so i would not have to keep plugging in and out my primary charger . i did n't think i could get such a good deal on a real dell product
elec	this photo paper is truly top of the line , profession grade paper . i have been using it for a few years in making very large photo prints - and they always turn out great .
elec	i have been enjoying these speakers outside by my pool for several months now , and the quality of the sound is excellent , particularly given the reasonable price . i 'm sure you can get better performance , but it will cost much more . these speakers are a rare find in today 's business world -- something that is actually a good deal ...
elec	i have had this printer for more than a year . at first , it was a great printer . not anymore ! ! it uses up ink like no other , yes , it is great to have the individual tanks ( which is why i bought the thing ) but now the print head is n't working right . do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanks up , and the problem is still there . the pages have splotchy black marks and the texts are only partially printed . went to the canon website , they do n't even acknowledge this printer ever existed . my recommendation is do n't buy this model ! !
elec	item is advertised as working with all rino series but it does not work with the rino 53
elec	this is great . it makes it easier for us all to listen to the music in the car
elec	i bought this drive in late 2003 , and it 's gone through a moderate amount of use in a home environment since then . the positives first - though it has an 8mb buffer it is very fast , and can even stand its ground against some newer disks with larger buffers . it does make quite a bit of noise and heats up a bit more compared to my older 40gig and 20gig wd 's , and the newer seagates . 2.5 years after purchase , the drive started corrupting files like crazy . wd has tools on their site to check your disk status , and sure enough it was due for an rma . when i checked the warranty status online , 6 months had mysteriously 'vanished ' from my warranty period . the drive warranty had started 6 months before i 'd purchased it ! anyway , it was still valid and they sent me a replacement very quick . still , this is my second wd drive to die , and i 'm going with other brands from now .
elec	it does everything promised but takes several hours of going over the instructions to figure out how to program some of the features . instructions hard to locate in booklet
elec	the machine does fine for quick cleaning of your cd's/dvd 's . i ca n't give a complete review of the product because i only tried to repair 1 dvd ... and it did not repair it
elec	i have multiple cameras , and one of my favorite features is that this reader can support multiple types of cards plugged in at one time . if you have a sd card and a cf card , both can be inserted and read/written to without having to switch out the cards . very nice reader for a great price . the blue led is very pleasant to look at .
elec	this cable looks nice , when you do n't linger on a digital channel . what happens to me is that if i leave the tv on a digital channel overnight , the next day it will be a split screen mode , showing double image of the broadcast . to fix it , i have to change it to a non-digital channel and switch it back . i guess it is possible that it is the cable box , but nothing happens like that on the component outputs
elec	this is a great little machine and has so many uses . i bought 2 of them and 2 days later came back to amazon to buy some more for gifts and the price has doubled ... what 's with that ? keep looking and you 'll find this at a hot price again eventually
elec	i also had the model before the m85v and got great reception . this new model gets terrible reception . i still have my old model and put the old one next to the new one and it was like night and day with the reception . do n't waste your money on this model !
elec	this sd would not work in my nikon coolpix s6 camera ( but the fuji and sandisk product did
elec	to my eyes , the printer 's rendition of colors is above average . it is n't horrible but neither is it the best . pricewise it 's an excellent deal with the 64mg of memory and the duplex feature . we 've been using this hp quite a lot to generate mailing labels via tray 2 ( the default paper supply ) and have n't any problems . the manual ( electronic file ) advises `` never print on the same sheet of labels more than once or print on a partial sheet of labels . '' so it 's a pity that the rest of a multiple mailing label sheet has to be tossed for just one label . a wonderful quality of experience is the near `` instant on '' ( very minimal warmup ) feature and it 's quiet . my previous okidata c5300 was a noisemaker and was turned on only just before printing . its time delay was also a disadvantage . i think most people will be very happy with the hp . [ ...
elec	it seems nice enough and it 's cheap , but it is apparently incompatible with the canon powershot digital elphs . for use with those cameras , buy sandisck instead . seriously
elec	we love this tuner , and the kids have had fun finding out what key different sounds make . they change their voice , tap on things with pencils , etc .
elec	i have two seperate units . one hardwired to my car , and the other is the jvc unit . i hooked it directly into the audio ( aux ) ports of my radio , rather than use an fm station . it works great , the sound quality is excellent as well - ( and my radio is so old it play 's 8-tracks ! ! ! ! ) . i did notice that the unit tends to run a bit warm to hot . i agree with the previous reviews , that it is something that jvc needs to look into , perhaps it is simply a matter of a `` heat sink-er '' not being in specs , as yet , i have encountered no problems ( having had the jvc unit for 1.5 years ) no matter . as to the commercial free : sirius ( which i have had a subscription to for the past 4 years ) has commercial free radio , though the news stations and a few others do have commercials . those stations are clearly defined as being in the commercial block . the music stations are 100 % free of commercial . all in all a damn cheap price to pay for avoidance of all those really irritating dj 's , commerical 's , and lack of variety in stations ! ~cheers !
elec	as the ps2 does not have hdmi outputs for high-definition tv 's , the monster cable gamelink 400 component cable is the next best thing and worth a few bucks more . you 'd have to be retarded to not notice the difference between these component cables and standard ( red , white , yellow ) av cables picture clarity . they are in two different worlds and monster fully delivers . however , your tv must have component ( red , blue , green ) inputs for this cable to be useful . ensure that you have a fiber optic digital cable for your sound to go from your ps2 to your compatible tv/receiver . these cables are for picture only and do not have a sound cable . therefore , you 'll have to forget using the single plug-in the ps2 offers for both audio and video . however , your sound will be uncompressed , fully digital audio . this is definitely a plus , rather than a negative . any mid-priced television or receiver built in the last six years will have a digital audio input
elec	do n't let the size fool you - i do n't know much about audio - yet - but i can tell you the sound recorded from this mic is wayyyy better than the usb microphone headset i was using . much crisper with out all the fuzziness . and i did n't spend nearly as much as the online gurus were recommending . i am sure the $ 600 mic is great - but this is doing every thing i need .
elec	i 'm using this in an area where , as usual , there is no map data for the trails and roads . navigating through old and obscured trail systems or just passable terrain , to known trails i 've been on is very cumbersome requiring switching between screens and allot of thumb work when i should have my chin up navigating . even then , the functionality is very limited . seems a big step forward on the software would make this product a really great tool , but so far it 's only a novelty item . in order to view the other trails in the area previously recorded i will need to purchase the $ 100 mapsend software which contains no useful data for me , only provides the functionality of editing/creating my own base map . a function i can only do on my laptop , something i usually do n't carry out into the wilderness . basically i bought this to use it to document my assaults on various ridges , passes , peaks and unknown road systems , while understanding my proximity to previously traveled routes to help me make progress . so far it 's a 0/5 points in this department . if you want to find your way back to points this is useful , however for other types of navigation involving linear objects , such as trails and roads , waterways the software is n't there yet
elec	i bought this for my wife . i have an iriver hp120 , which i consider to be one of the best ever made . i have to say , i think this is a great little player . the interface is well designed , the unit is well made , and the sound quality is excellent . i purchased a u2 about 1 year ago as a gift , which was also excellent . i think cowon is making some of the better mp3 players on the market now , and i would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a high quality unit
elec	i ' writing this eview onthe nwkeoard tht i picked up a few urs don stop redingdue to th numerous misspellins and rors . that 's the kyboard , nome ! ! i'mt ba to to y na o y n acino esr i ia . ok , switching over to a wired keyboard ! ! the above mess was me trying to type on the microsoft 6000 v2 keyboard ! ! i 'm taking it back to the store asap ! ! according to the programs , i have a full signal on both the keyboard and the mouse while typing , but you see what comes out ! not once have i had a low signal warning or anything . i just get random intermittent letters to appear . now , perhaps it 's because the receiver is back by my monitor and the keyboard is on the keyboard tray , but my goodness ! this thing is supposed to have a range of 6 feet . i measured and they 're about a foot and a half apart ! ! i type for hours on end per day and have been typing `` properly '' for about 16 years . i type much too fast and much too frequently to be able to deal with such random signals ! ! another thing i noticed about the 6000 ( and actually was concerned with it while i was trying it out in the store ) is that it makes my fingers feel cramped . perhaps it 's due to the curve of the keyboard and i 'm just not used to it yet ( although i have used split key ergonomic keyboards and never had a probelm with them . the 4000 felt fine ( even though it has a somewhat awkward layout ! ! ) no matter what , that thing is going back ! i 'm far too agitated to keep it ! oh , there are some neato plusses ! i love the shortcut keys . it 's nice to be able to just hit one key and get my e-mail , my music , my pictures , or whatever else i assign the keys to . i had gotten excited about that feature , and will be sad to lose it ( even though i only had it for about an hour . ) better luck to the rest of you
elec	i tried it on 4 laptops , and none of them was able to sustain the signal . it kept on dropping out ! mind you , two of the internal cards did a much better job than it .
elec	i could n't believe how great this cd case is ! i had a ton of loose cd 's all over the place because i did n't have any cases . with this i could hold them all with a ton of room to spare !
elec	i purchased this so my pc could share a monitor with my xbox360 . does the job at a cheap cost ! so easy to use that my 4 yr. old can use it
elec	i , ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you `` must '' plug in . hey guys , try it without an outside energy source , i just hope i , m not gon na fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered usb port . i have a very high end system though with wattage to sprare , but no more pci slots , damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards , why do 2 of em have to take up so much room . oh well , trade offs are a bi -- - , but a reality and 7 extra usb slots are awfully nice
elec	i purchased the 2gb elite pro sd card but found out that my older simpletech flashlink card reader is not able to recognize the card under winxp sp2 with and without the most recent simpletech drivers . i do n't have another card reader for my computer , but the pictures recorded on it by my digital camera can be viewed on my pda so i assume that it 's the card reader . shortly afterwards , i also discovered that kingston makes a combo kit that includes their usb 2.0 sd/mmc reader for a bit less in price than the card alone . i also noticed the atp line of 60x and 150x sd cards . i have no experience with their products , but their sd cards are potted versus placed in a plastic shell . they tout their cards as being more rugged and waterproof . i 'm very careful and have not had any flash cards fail on me , but with the rising capacities and smaller form factors , i will consider the atp cards in the future .
elec	i will never buy a brand new product release from linksys again . their q.c . stinks . i am on the third wrt54gx4 router and it is the first that was not defective . i got it set up and tried my new wpc54gx4 network card ( srx400 ) and got a weak signal , but i had my second laptop with a wpc54gx card ( srx200 ) on the desk getting 100 % signal strength . i switched cards in the two computers , and the old srx200 card was better in either computer ( both xp pro ) . after hours with semi-english speaking techs , they came to the same conclusion i came to in five minutes ... a bad antenna in the new wpc54gx4 . so once again amazon will replace a defective linksys product for me . i had been a linksys fan in the past , but not any more . here 's a link to a picture of the first router i got and its defect . http : //vowe.net/archives/006639.htm
elec	tried this with two different computers using windows vista . got this message : `` one of the usb devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned , and windows does not recognize it . '' the mini-disk that came with it was no help . no response from tiger direct . went to radio shack and got one . it works
elec	in the ten minutes since i 've had it out of the box two pieces have fallen off . more importantly , it ca n't handle large manuals as advertised . ( the reason i purchased this particular book holder ) my 1000 page manual only fits if you happen to only want to read the middle chapter . based on that i estimate that this is a totally worthless product to anyone needing to go through a manual or training book more than five or six hundred pages . if you do n't anticipate needing it for a book that big then just glue the rubber feet on , keep an eye on the page retainers ( these are the parts that fell off ) and you should be ok. as for me , i 'm off to read amazon 's return policy and see if i can get rid of this useless hunk of plastic
elec	this carrying case worked well for me until i jumped in my car and the case caught on the door frame and the belt clip ripped right off of it , causing my ipod to fall to the pavement . it turns out the clip is n't fastened on all that securely
elec	without a doubt this is the best product of its type , i looked at several others priced significantly higher , and after setting up the am2 it was clear i had made the best choice
elec	so this controller looked pretty sweet to me so i bought it over a rumble pad . i liked the idea of fans for wicking away sweat , as i tend to get pretty white knuckled on my controllers . i bought this controller specifically for star wars battlefront 2 on pc , and it works like a dream . i also like the x-box controller layout ( offset anolog sticks and more ergonomic ) than the ps2 style controller that is the logitech rumble pad . it also has better grips than a ps2 controller . the only things i think are bad about it are the following : 1 . it is not modeled on the large xbox controller , but rather the regular one , which is ok for most people , but i have big hands and i get a bit cramped up if i play for way too long . 2 . i was slightly dissapointed with the lack of custimization software available with this pad . i have a saitek cyborg evo joystick that you can create custom profiles for every game you want to use it with then set that profile before launching the game . this is n't an issue with battlefront 2 since it has a very excellent in game control configurator , but i could see where if a game did n't have as good an interface ( or maybe older games ) this pad could suffer in this regard . 3 . this is n't so much an issue for me , but i would assume that with a lot of game play and turning on and off of the fan , that the fan motor will likely die sooner than the pad will wear out . i do n't care too much , because the fan is more a novelty to me than anything . i will still use it even if it does die . overall , a great controller , i actually would give it a 4.5 rating , but that is n't an option here
elec	when you look at the price , it may seem pricey but when you get the product , there is some serious engineering involved . the web reviews have all been favorable and this is the reason i bought an ergotron . the attention to detail is incredible . mounting the middle monitor is definitely a two-person job . other than that the installation was flawless . this is a very solid and well machined . kudos to ergotron . ( also these guys are serious about ergonomics -- 10 pages on how to set proper height for various installations . ) wonderful product - 5 stars . shipping from amazon was slow and behind schedule .
elec	i have had this printer for more than a year . at first , it was a great printer . not anymore ! ! it uses up ink like no other , yes , it is great to have the individual tanks ( which is why i bought the thing ) but now the print head is n't working right . do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanks up , and the problem is still there . the pages have splotchy black marks and the texts are only partially printed . went to the canon website , they do n't even acknowledge this printer ever existed . my recommendation is do n't buy this model ! !
elec	the shape conforms perfectly to the designer 's hands , but unless you share the same dna , i 'd avoid this product . i 've used many of these over the years and this is the only one i struggled with . constantly shifting it to get it 's high and low points in a place that was tolerable . i finally reversed it , pointing it towards me and it worked a little better . this just needs to be a simple pad . instead , they 've overdesigned it as a gimmick .
elec	code length of this product is very small . i had to buy an extention cord . the sound quality is not bad
elec	switch did not work with my samsung 191t monitor . customer service people were slow to respond and were not helpful
elec	i would like to believe that this hub works well- but i would n't know . i bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac . i hooked up my printer , ipod and digital camera and nothing happened . i called targus and they said i needed an a/c adaptor . it does n't come with one and does n't say anything about one in the manual or instructions , or their website . they said i could get it at radio shack and gave me the info ( 5 volt , 2.1 amp , center positive ) . i 've been to two radio shacks and online- they do n't carry it . i 'm upset . any advice
elec	i did not notice in the product description that this product interfaces to the serial port on a computer . since most new computers use usb for serial interface , the usefulness of this unit is limited . my two newly purchased hp computers do not have an interface that is compatible with this product . i would not have bought it had i known this . i have not used the gps since i bought it . it will probably be tossed out . the serial cable is hidden behind cardboard in the clamshell package . so you do n't see it prior to opening the package . once the package is opened it is a mess that probably can not be returned . lastly , this is one of the worst packaging jobs i have seen . the plastic clamshell is so hard to open that i think the customer is in danger being cut by the opening knife or scissors . the cut plastic is also dangerous
elec	a terrific idea : show the current time and the alarm times all at once . very intuitive , very helpful . unfortunately , the backlit lcd display just does n't make the grade . the numbers do not stand out against the bright background enough to be easily readable . the manufacturer 's photo makes the numbers look sharp and clear , but the customer image from wickedpete is much more realistic . the numbers just wash out . it 's interesting that the customer image shows the orange and green backlights reversed from the manufacturer 's image and from the unit i got . i think that would be a slight improvement , because on the one i got , the orange ( backlighting the alarm times ) is about twice as bright as the green ( backlighting the current time ) , and it just looks weird . also , fm radio reception is quite poor . the line cord is supposed to serve as the antenna , but that just does n't work well no matter how i orient the cord . i ca n't tune in a strong station just 10 miles away . so back it goes
elec	i am very happy with my meridian color and the other mapsend products i have purchased , however , at first i couldnt get this product to work . i had no problem getting this software to run with xp ( even without the patch ) , however i couldnt view the basemap i had loaded onto my magellan . i tried to address this with the company . it has been three days now and they have not even returned my emails . customer service for this product is nonexistant . i joined the yahoo message board and got a simple answer to my question in about four hours someone posted the answer . turns out i just had to go to the menu -- card utilities and maunually select the basemap . i did not know that basemaps dont change automaticaly like the detailed maps do . i cannt say enough great things about my experience with my magellan meridian color though . navigating through hungary like a pro , i didnt miss a single turn . i would never recommend any of their products to someone who isnt willing or doesnt have the aptitude to learn about it . the magellan meridian series is in my opinion the finest product on the market for what it does , portability it provides and is 100 percent upgradable with new software and new maps . get you head out of your a__ thales . you have some great products , but you are blowing your customer support base with non existant customer support . i recommend anyone with a question about softward or the gps join the yahoo groups and post the question there . dont waste your time with customer support .
elec	i have an ipaq pda and i own a tomtom gps -- both of which work well . this combo ipaq/tomtom is 'in the rough ' and needs to undergo some re-tooling . i 'm surprised that other reviewers mention what i deem significant flaws and then go on to rate the unit as a 4 or 5 star . for example , the travel companion stalls and needs soft-resets . for a right handed person , the stylus is awkward . support is not good . moving through programs can be painfully slow . the gps tracking lags . i depend on my gps and pda for business travel . buy the rx5915 if you like to play with gadgets as it 's loaded with some fun stuff . but , not if you need something dependable while on the road .
elec	not sure if i just got a lemon or what but would never purchase this player again . it worked right most of the time , but found that at times it would confuse the change disc button with the eject button . i would have to turn the unit on and off to get it to `` reset '' and work correctly . it 's now about 9 months later and the unit decided it was time to stop working . bought it because it was cheap and i guess i got what i paid for . fork out the extra cash and purchase another brand
elec	i saw the small size of this case and was in love . it has plenty of space for dvds and cords ( though it wont hold large headphones unless they fold ) . it is padded enough for protection but not too padded to be too bulky . it 's great . you wont regret it .
elec	i bought the intuos 6x11 pen tablet couple weeks ago and i use it almost every day so far so good , i do n't expect to have any problems with it . i used to have a small wacom graphire and i used for years then unfortunately the pen broke so now i own a new one the only advice i can give to you is to keep it clean , wipe it out every now and then with a wet cloth jo
elec	i mean ... 10 usbs , sli , 6 satas , support for up to 13 gb of ram and theorethically more . too much
elec	the ad and description clearly state that it includes both a receiver and transmitter . i received only a receiver . this is false advertising and is patently illegal . they ought to be ashamed of themrselves
elec	product came broken now your out of stock , and i do not have that credit card anymore.so now what . i would like my money back . address 2655 forest blvd . jax , fl.3224
elec	my 2 year old saw this in bjs and kept asking for it , so santa brought it for him for christmas . i think it 's a good first guitar . he loves to strum it , but he definitely needs to be supervised to teach him to respect that it is a special musical instrument , not a toy . so far he has sat on it and used it as a drum and it 's held up fine , but i do n't think it would hold up with such continued abuse . it is recommended for children much older than he is , so i ca n't expect anything different . i do wish they made a smaller version of it so it would be more comfortable for him . for a better price than i see at amazon , you can get a small hohner guitar at a music store , which might be better quality , i 'm not sure . regardless , i am very happy with this guitar and i would recommend it for any child who shows a real interest in music . i would not buy it for a child just as a toy , unless you do n't mind it being destroyed . i am planning to buy the guitar strap and will review that when i get it
elec	my job requires a kvm switch for qa purposes to test different os/browser combinations . in building the lab i decided to go with belkin after researching various switches . i 'm configuring a lab with a mac g4 , mac mini , nc6000 laptop and hp dc5100 mini tower . i 'm using the hp supplied keyboard and mouse , and a viewsonic 19 lcd flatscreen . the first kvm worked well for right at 30 days . at that point the mouse began to act erratic , followed shortly by the switch only working in the # 1 slot ( laptop ) . i ordered a second switch and the same thing happened within 30 days again . i 'm going to return the switch and try the well rated iogear miniview 4 port usb kvw .
elec	after all the hype on-line about the t-amp , i had to check it out for myself . all the reports are true ! this is one hot little audio amp which can not be touched for the price . if you have a portable audio device and two speakers you need to drive with it - this amp is for you . you will not be disappointed . i recommend purchasing the ac power supply as well . you can find others cheaper , but the recommended one works perfectly and insures the warrantee for the t-amp remains valid
elec	first of all , the shipping on this item costs more than the item itself . i did get it quickly ( 2 or 3 days ) , but i had several problems with it : ( 1 ) i repeatedly tried it on my dvd player and the player hung . each time i had to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to respond . i tried over 10 times and got the same result each time . ( 2 ) i tried it on dvd drive 1 on my computer and it hung as well . had to ctrl-alt-del to get my dvd player software to close . on the 3rd attempt it actually did work . ( 3 ) i repeatedly tried it on dvd drive 2 on my computer . each time i got a message saying `` no disk '' . i consider it item a waste of money
elec	simply put , the keyboard sticky scuff cover never flattens out completely . there are always bubbles . if you like playing with them all the time then this product is for you . the keyboard soft material cover is not so bad , but holds onto the dirt and oils that would normally get on your screen and keyboard . so , when you close the lid , the material then transfers some of that dirt right back . my resolve ... just wipe your keyboard and screen with a soft , clean , semi-wet towel every so often and the macbook pro will keep its luster
elec	i got this card last month and i 've been using it heavily . its been great . its sturdy and can has great range . there are a few problems though . # 1 there is no case for the card . # 2 the included browser only lasts for 30 days and its horrible . luckily i had netfront 3.1 # 3 memory stick lan software will occasionally error , but a soft reset will fix it . otherwise its a great little expansion card
elec	installation time was only about 20 min . hook up the digital and analog cables , and it configures itself . it took me a while to decide which resolution to use that was best for me , but once i found it , i was really pleased with the size and clarity . music composition is much easier with the big screen . one small con was the stand is not adjustable , but it fit perfectly into my office space , so i did n't need the adjustment . the video quality on this lcd is amazing . ronnie be
elec	i used it once and it charged my ipod only 80 % after about four hours . the next day i tried it again and it simply ceased functioning entirely . this thing is garbage !
elec	this very expensive cable is already in the package if you purchased the forerunner 201 . you wo n't need this unless you somehow lost it . damn , it is expensive ! this is a cable for goodness sake
elec	very solid , nice looking shelf , easy to assemble with good instructions and all required pieces included . it 's exactly as i expected it
elec	amazon was great about shipping this product , but i eventually returned it due to several problems . they were also great about the return -- they paid the return shipping and i got a full refund . i never tried any recordings with this card using the media center software that is part of windows mce . i was using it with snapstream beyondtv 4.1 . if you record using anything but the best ( dvd 720x480 ) quality level it would crop out part of the picture . this is a known issue that is apparently a driver issue . the latest hauppauge driver did not solve the problem . the other problem i had is that several times when i was recording two programs at the same time , one of the recordings had nothing but static for the audio portion of it . i do n't know if this was a problem with the card or beyondtv , but i think it 's probably due to the card . i do n't know if i had a defective card or if this is just a problem with all of these cards . i also was not that impressed with the overall quality of the video this card captured . i have hauppauge 250 and 350 cards in a couple of other pcs , and the video quality they capture is noticeably better than that captured by the 500 card . after reading some reviews , it sounds like this is the case for the 150 card also ( and the 500 card is basically just two 150s placed on one card ) . beyondtv works great with the 250 and 350 cards with none of the issues noted above ; but i also only have one tuner card in the pcs that i use these cards in , so i ca n't comment on how well they would work in a dual tuner setup using beyondtv . i returned the 500 card , and i instead purchased two visiontek xtasy theater 550 pro cards . thus far i 'm not having any of the issues with them in beyondtv that i was having with the hauppauge 500 card -- i can record at a lower quality level with no cropping , and i 've had no audio issues so far . the quality of the video is also far superior to that captured by the 500 card ( although maybe not as good as that captured by the hauppauge 250 and 350 cards ) .
elec	i have been using a lot mouses during last years , but this is the best far away from the others . it 's very comfortable to use it ... ..
elec	i am very unhappy with the product i received from tiger . it was not what i wanted and to return it would cost me more than i paid for it . the company charges tooooo many fees . i am very unhappy now i have a product that i ca n't use or return
elec	good thing first , efficient on battery , convenient and compact..doubles up as flash drive and no cables except headphone to carry around to charge . thats it . as most of the other reviewers have said this product is absolutely useless because of low iq software people working in sony . utterly non user friendly . i develop software for a living and i am not afraid to use new software ... even though i was able to use the software the main drawbacks are the over smartness of software where it tries to control the music piracy.. i had 1gb of atrac songs on this player from my computer . then one day my computer hdd crashed . i was kind of thankful that i had saved atleast 1 gb of music on this bean walkman . atleast all the hours i spent in transfering did not go waste . as soon as i fixed the new hdd and tried to transfer the songs back to my computer..the useless sony softwre will not take the music files back ... i tried every trick and even the sony customer support could not help me ( a very indifferent group of people ) . it is a rotten piece of software and that makes this efficient device a waste of money . of course transfering the files to this player is an entirely diff story and i dont want to go abt that.. it is absolutely infuriating
elec	it 's a great tool to have at all times . security , provacy , and power in one little handy device . and the u3 apps are multiplying quickly . next i want a full-blown system on a flash drive
elec	i purchase this on amazon for $ 499 no tax free shipping . you can not match this quality at this price . the hd with hdmi cable using comcast digital box is outstanding . the sound is also better with the hdmi vs componet cables . the jacks are hard to connect in the back of the set and you need to set the picture to manuel mode . the picture is to red on the preset modes and looks like there is too much color . i looked at samsung for $ 800 and i am glad i saved myself $ 300 with this lcd
elec	does not work on vista . sooooo disappointed because my laptop sound completely disappeared with vista upgrade ( save for the windows startup music ) . i thought this new sound card would bring my sounds back . might have , but it says not compatible with vista . i guess i 'll be getting a new computer . :
elec	i first saw these speakers at the apple store , and i really liked the sound and the look . i went on amazon and found a better price and i couldnt be happier with them . as long as you have a decent soundcard , these speakers really are great . i have had no problem with them at all , they look really cool , they 're loud , they 're small , the woofer gives you a lot of bass ( which you can turn down ) , and the sound from the speakers is clear . buy these
elec	its a great graphics card , especially for the price . i got it to improve roller coaster tycoon 3 and it did . but the controls arent as clear as they could be for the anti-aliasing settings and the anisotropic filtering
elec	if you can make it work or if you are lucky to get a non defective unit : it can only read 1 card at a time needs specific usb power requirements ( needs the usb power be +5v and not +5vsb ) else you will get `` usb hub power exceeded errors '' the worst part is that the mainboard i tested is +5v ... and still did n't work the cards inserted on the lower card slots have to be inserted upside down from time to time you can get the message usb device not recognized ... contacted support ... service there = average/not so good ( support forum has several topics complaining about this product ) could n't get a replacement since 30 days tigerdirect warranty have expired , ca n't send the unit to ultra because currently i 'm outside the us and as i stated customer service is not good . bottom line do n't buy this item
elec	i purchased this item per other recommendations and that of stereophile magazine , thinking that this would be useful for broadcasting itunes and internet radio programming to other parts of my home . first , reception was terrible even with the reciever placed only a few feet away from the transmitter . second , i tried the tweak ( turning up the volume pot ) suggested in other ratings . this did n't help matters from a reception standpoint , in addition , the unit is so poorly constructed that the mere act of opening it dislodges the volume potentiometer . third , the volume pot itself is of very poor construction . in short , it does n't work , you wo n't be happy -- even if you attempt to `` fix '' it yourself -- do n't buy this product
elec	contrary to popular belief , i even had a good experience the one time i needed technical support . a few random disconnects , but overall a great product
elec	i bought this deck about 6 months ago . it has performed flawless in every aspect . as soon as i turned it on i could notice a big difference in the sound quality from my old poineer deck . i have taken all of my cd 's out of my truck because there is no need for the cd player if you take advantage of the ipod interface . the ipod function is flawless and easy to use . just plug in your ipod and search by artist , album , song title or playlist . this can get a little tricky while driving ecpecially if you have a large library so i would suggest using playlists . the output of sound quality from an ipod is amazing . also there is a very useful bass engine that is very useful if you have subs , this function allows for flawless bass output and easy ajustment . this deck is the best overall i have ever listened to
elec	i was so excited about how great this product worked when i got it . i had purchased the fm transmitter for my wife and they do not work so great so i thought since my car had a tape deck i would give this a try . i was excited that i had all my ipod music with me , but after less than a week it the sound started going down hill to a point where i could n't listen anymore with it . it is now in a landfill somewhere . my guess is i will need a radio in the car that is ipod compatiable cable . for now just have the radio and cds i burn
elec	i have been looking for an easier way to protect the front my my lens without having to either take off my lens hood or trying to fumble around with the lens cap with the hood still on . op/tech came up with the solution ! all you have to do is stretch the proper size hood hat over the hood and everything is protected and ready to go . super easy to take off , putting on takes a little more time , but you never miss a picture putting it on anyway . basically this is an inexpensive way to add some extra insurance against getting dirt , water , etc on your front element while you are walking around looking for shots . it is also very flexible and easy to stick in a pouch or pocket when not being used
elec	while i 'm driving , this thing does n't work at all . there 's tons of static and the music cuts out all the time . the only time this fm transmitter works is when my car is still . maybe it 's because my antenna is on the back of my rear window and the transmitter ca n't reach it . overall , i 'd say this product is garbage
elec	overall i do n't like it . when the screen is black between scenes and what not , their is a lot of mixed in red and other colors from interference . buy a different one , this one is just not up to the task
elec	bought this a month ago for use with my dx4330 kodak 3mp digital camera . it worked for 2 days.after that , everytime i on the camera , it wanted me to reformat the card , wth is that ? now i ca n't use it at all ... . i 'm always so confidence with my previous purchases from amazon.one mistake i made , i threw away the shipping and product packages once i tested out the card , thought it worked and it would be ok.i can no longer return it now . needless to say , i 'm too over confident with lexar 's products . buyers beware ...
elec	the material and ergonomics of this phone is average . the selling point of this phone for me is its ability to connect up to 10 handsets using one phone line . below are the factors that i considered before purchasing and my experience : range : the range of the phone is very good . i can be 80-100 feet away from the base unit and the call signal will stay constant and not drop . call quality : average . i have a plantronics cs50 wireless headset that is on the 900 mhz frequency connected to a corded base unit . the call quality on the wireless headset is crystal clear . when i have switched during mid-conversation from the handset to headset , or vice-versa , callers have noted a significant difference in the clarity of the call . the uniden is much more muffled and less clear . it is however comparable to most cordless phone . not exceptional , but not bad . durability : average . i have dropped my handsets on rare occasions , they survived the drops onto the carpet quite well . one of the handset did drop onto my hardwood floor , which cracked the screen but the force was not significant and it did n't scratch the hardwood floor . special note : i suffered a power outage during a major windstorm . the base unit will not boot up . this appears to have happened to other reviewers . this problem appears to have afflicted only this piece of electronic in my whole house . on this issue , i have to drop my rating from 3 stars to 2 stars
elec	as with some of the other reviewers , mine stopped working and blew the fuse in my car for the cigarette lighter . i bought a vector brand inverter at wal-mart and it is much better
elec	i bought it for my canon s3 is . first i tried it without formatting and fill it up with photos and video and no problems . then i did the suggested format by canon and it worked the same : perfect . fast enough to cope with the demands of the camera ; have n't any problem of corruption . i 've been tempted to buy another one .
elec	i use my lx4 2.1 system as my desktop pc speakers . i got this recommendation from maximum pc , since the lx4 5.1 system was 2005 's best speaker system . you can view their gear of the year review here : http : //www.maximumpc.com/2005/12/m-audio_studiop_1.html . being skeptical of a $ 550 5.1 system with only 27 watts to each satellite , i wanted to start slow and only ordered the 2.1 system . as soon as i purchased cables ( fyi : no 1/8 '' stereo to two 1/4 '' mono cables seem to exists -as far as i 've seen -- , so you have to use adaptors ) i was blown away by the crisp flowing sounds of the speakers . i was n't used to speakers with crossovers , where only the each type of speaker ( tweeter , woofer , and sub ) gets the right frequencies , so no overlapping exists . all the sounds are crystal clear and the housings is very dense and resilient , while the speakers themselves are of superb build quality . after only a few hours of listening to many kinds of music and playing sound-intensive games , i immediately hopped back online and ordered myself the 5.1 expander setup . if you are looking for speakers that play really loud , or can fill a living room with the desired feel for an action movie , these are not for you . but if you want incredibly accurate pc speakers or relatively cheap studio monitors this is definitely the setup for you . you will not be disappointed if you buy the lx4 for your bedroom or for computer use
elec	after owning a p-touch labeler for years , i found the need for a more duable label than my `` m '' tape was providing . i opted for this `` tz '' tape labeler . good price , looks good . what a mistake ! ! ! the only thing well designed about this unit is it 's abilty to waste more tape than it uses ! ! if you print a label of any size , count on it costing you two full inches of tape to do it ! ! ! at $ 20.00 a roll , prepare to be screwed each time you push the print button.then go find the scissors and cut the excess off , so the label does not look as stupid as the person who designed this pile of junk ! ! ! but cheer up you can push six buttons , every time , to reduce the margin to `` narrow '' . this will reduce the waste to a half inch on one side of the label , and print two small dots on the other side , this will show you where to cut it with your scissors , to match the `` narrow '' side . also you must do all settings for every label every time ! ! another `` great feature , it will use the same amount of tape regaurdless of print size , so you will only print large print.what a joke ! ! ! what a hassle ! ! now the good news . i used to make lots of labels , and now i only make labels for very important items . and only when i am up to getting mad for doing so . i really wish amazon would allow us to give items a negative five stars ! you have been warned
elec	i bought this enclosure about 1 year ago . i put a 200gb hard drive in it and use it as my dedicated itunes library . it was a super easy setup . many complain in the other reviews that it 's a tight fit inside , but i did n't find it difficult at all to get the hard drive in . after connecting the hard drive and closing it up , i simply connected it via firewire to my mac g4 and it worked like a charm ! next month i will have it for 1 year and i would be 100 % happy with it if not for one thing ... the loud fan noise after about 10 minutes of it being turned on ! arghh ! ! all of a sudden it just starts sounding off with this annoying buzzing sound that gets slightly louder with time . every-so-often , the buzzing goes away for about 1 to 2 minutes , but it always returns with a vengence ! otherwise , the enclosure has held up and worked nicely for almost 1 year . i 'm definitly going to get rid of it though once i find an enclosure that is equally aesthetically pleasing and as reliable , but not nearly as noisy ! ! ! it 's a shame actually , since i 'm in the market to get 2 more enclosures to house my aperture library and data backup , respectively
elec	this unit satisfies in its gps functionality , but is problematic elsewhere . when i decided to purchase a gps , i decided to spend the extra money and get a integrated handsfree bluetooth unit for my phone ( motorola razr v3 ) . the bluetooth connection was easy to set up and reliably would find my phone and connect . unfortunately , the bluetooth connection would disconnect after about five minutes , even though the 6000t would still show the unit and phone as connected . customer service was no help ... . it seems their script only includes the instructions `` download the latest software '' ( i already had ) and `` reset the unit '' ( did n't help ) . second problem : the unit started turning itself off randomly ( actually , it went into `` sleep mode '' ) while driving down the road . the customer service response ? you are correct ... . `` download the latest software '' ( i already had ) and `` reset the unit '' ( did n't help ) . i finally complained loudly enough that they told me to send the unit in for repair ( at my expense , of course ) . i received it back and the bluetooth feature was not repaired . their solution for the unit randomly going into sleep mode ? they turned off the power management so the unit would not go into sleep mode under any circumstance . well , i suppose that is a solution , but a pretty crappy one since , if you forget to power down the unit manually when you leave the vehicle , the gps battery will be totally drained when you get back in the car . i expected much better at this price point . shoulda gone with garmin
elec	the is perhaps the lease durable item i have purchased in 40 years . it lights up just fine , and it is a reassuring led gold , but it refuses to do anything with my xd card . it worked just fine for 3-4 days , then erased about 100 photos , all of them irreplaceable . cheap yes , but cheap junk .
elec	while the two fans i ordered for a new computer build are functioning properly , they are not as advertised on amazon 's website . according to the specs on the site , they have a double ball-bearing design which last longer than normal fans . be warned , these are not the antec double ball-bearing fans , but the less expensive ones . have contacted amazon and hope they update the specs to reflect these accurately
elec	i have went through so many cd-r blanks and finally found some with some good dye and have zero error burning rate . tdk is amazing . the first one i 've burned i 've now had for over a year and still no defects on the back of it . it 's amazing
elec	product name is the same but outlook is totally different from the picture on the web . in addition , no `` all region code '' supportted ! i will return it asap .
elec	this device worked great for a short span of time ( a few weeks ) , then just stopped working . i returned it to amazon and received a new replacement . it worked fine for a while , then stopped working . it 's a great idea , but very weak quality
elec	i do not think suction cup mounts work very well . this one is no exception . while attaching and detaching my garmin nuvii is easy enough , the cup does not support the weight . i was disappointed that a friction bag was not available for my nuvii . however , i was able to jury-rig an acceptable if less than pretty compromise . i ordered the friction mount , removed the screws on the bottom , detaching the mounts that would not fit my nuvii , and stapled velcro strips purchased at walmart across the base of the suction cup into the friction mount . i have been cross country using this system and it works . the garmin portable friction mount for gps 010-10306-00 combined with the suction cup is a much better solution than the cup by itself
elec	my friend has this cord to connect his ipod to his stereo , and it works great , great sound , good ease of use etc . i wanted one so i went to bestbuy today and got one by rca that sounds just as good for $ 7.99
elec	one warning for users with over head lights . the 6000 keyboard that has tranparent ( light gray ) keys is very hard to read if the lighting is not quite right . i have a light directly above my desk and the reflected glare off the keys makes all the letters and numbers disappear . go for a black key or similar model
elec	i like to purchase service or replacement contracts on all my electronics needs , just set back and relax ... .your covered .
elec	i have been using memorex dvd-r blank media for more than a year and have gotten fine recordings with my new dvd player/recorder . not all of my recordings were successful , no product i know is 100 % perfect , but the majority have been successful with memorex dvd blank media . this 50-pack spindle was purchased from amazon because i know i can rely on them to give you the best in quality and value plus free shipping . moreover , i have never really been disappointed with anything purchased from amazon . after trying many dvd-r blank media , i found memorex dvd-r spindles to be affordable and reliable for a better than average performance .
elec	i wish i had read the amazon reviews of this item before i paid $ 19 for it at an office supply store . it may seem a bit trivial , but the smell of this wrist pad was a deal breaker . it 's unfortunate , too , because everything else about it is perfect : the color , the comfortable gel support and soft fabric , and the size ( it runs the length of my mac keyboard and provides support when i use my mouse ) . but the smell : a piercing , toxic smell that does not go away . it does n't matter if i spend five minutes or five hours in front of my computer , i still smell the synthetic backing of the wrist pad , and it 's made it impossible for me to work . i finally had to get rid of it
elec	the six commonly used power tips provide flexibility with this product . i purchased this to use as an interface between a cd walkman player and the ac power cord . the heads have specific polarity ; so it is possible to attach the heads incorrectly . however , if you pay attention to the plus and minus hookups as indicated , it 's not too difficult to make the attachment correctly the first time . i found the product to work effectively . the only negative i can see is that the actual plug-in device is a bit bulky ; so if you want to use this in a power strip setting , the ah3wh can be a bit of a plug hog . however , other than that limitation , the product was reliable . recommended to save on those batteries which do add up
elec	this was my first , and only , purchase of a linksys product . i unhappily discovered that it would not work with my multifunction printer , then hooked it up to another printer , only to have it die just out of warranty . a completely worthless piece of chinese made technology that is so bad the manufacturer does n't even stand behind it
elec	out of the past 20 burns , i have only had 10 dvd 's burn successfully . i use roxio cd creator version 7 , which does a great job with my cd 's , so i 'm pretty sure it 's the dvd media . not only am i wasting all my money , but my time as well . i 've tried to lower the burn speed , but it does not matter . i 'd try something else
elec	great features with the microsoft mouse . wanted at least a 4 button mouse so internet travel is much easier . comes with a usb dongle that i did not want to use so i was determined to get this mouse working with the built-in bluetooth in my new dell latitude notebook . found that the toshiba drivers provided by dell for the bluetooth would not work with the microsoft mouse . seems still some incompatibility with different manufactures of bluetooth devices . go figure ... . had to delete the toshiba drivers and let xp with sp-2 provide the drivers and it works great . pros : great features , no cord , long battery life between charges ( days ) , very responsive . cons : some difficulty getting it to work without supplied dongle , bigger than i like to pack around for a notebook .
elec	in general , lexar 's usb drive does its job just as well as other usb drives ; there is n't much of a difference except for the following : 1 ) portability good : it has a convenient way of attaching to your keychain bad : this rubber holder only lasts for so long ( in my case 6-8 months ) 2 ) it is extremely durable . this drive survived a full 30 minute ( clothes ) washer cycle . when i took it out of the washer , i thought all the data and the drive was gone for good . to my surprise ( after letting it dry for a day ) it worked just fine . this is amazing ! i have also accidentally stepped on it while wearing shoes ( not using all of my weight though ) a few times on carpet and concrete ; and still works fine . finally , i have dropped this drive on a variety of surfaces and it 's still fine . 3 ) looks : good : it is very easy to see since it is bright red bad : it is fatter than other usb drives and it is bright red . the drive is pretty ugly . it maybe good to note however , that the drive 's structure is probably a good reason as to why it has survived my abuse . the bright red color 's advantage has already been mentioned above
elec	i bought one for my son at christmas and it broke after a month . it just suddenly would n't turn on . amazon was great with sending a replacement in just two days , before even getting the original back . but the replacement model `` froze up '' after just 4 days and this time i am getting a refund . to quote an e-mail from amazon regarding this product `` as it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than we originally thought , we are not able to send another replacement . '' so , do not order one !
elec	the case was advertised in a size large enough to accomodate my camera but when i received it the size was very small . now i am stuck with something i can not use . your return policy was that it had to be in original packaging and unopened . how is one to know unless they open it
elec	i ca n't remember when i felt so good about an online purchase . the product is more than i expected for the money and the quick service just awed me ! i will definately be doing business through amazon many , many more times in the future ! thank you
elec	i have to say this mouse pad has far exceeded anything i hoped for . when i first opened the box it was shipped in i was very put off . there was a very , very strong chemical smell . i chalked it up to something in the packaging material . it turns out that was not where the smell was coming from . it was the mouse pad itself . having worked in a shoe factory years ago i was able to identify the smell as an industrial glue . the smell hung around for a couple of days . now , 1 week after having received my purchase if i put my nose close to the pad , it still carries the faint smell of industrial glue . i would caution those with allergies and/or asthma to consider this prior to purchase . as an asthmatic i can say it did affect my breathing some what . that seems to have gotten better as the smelled has lessened . i have finished with my public health warning . on to the mouse pad . it is simply the best mouse pad i have ever used . i have had wrist problems for over 4 years now . i have had swelling and pain from my right pinkie finger to my elbow as a result of console gaming and lots of keyboarding work . in the past week my swelling has greatly reduced . my pain is almost gone . my wrist sits perfectly on the wrist rest . the pad actually cradles my wrist . the wrist rest moves with my hand , so well and with so much support , it seems to be an extension of my body . a new improved appendage . i have found myself resting my wrist on the pad even while not computing but just sitting at my desk . it truly is that comfortable . i already have plans to purchase two more for friends as christmas gifts . worth every cent ! go for it ! you will not be disappointed !
elec	after looking around at the local stores ( fry 's and compusa ) i had just about given up on finding a single case that would offer reasonable protection for my ipod in multiple environments - on my belt and also in exercise , and had resigned myself to having a `` skin '' type case for just everyday use and then shifting the ipod to an arm band for exercise . not a particularly great solution - expensive ( around $ 20 for each ) and a lot of shifting back and forth to cover both uses . then i ran into the dlo action jacket at best buy , which seemed to cover all my intended uses . unlike the prior reviewer , i found my 40g ipod fits very snugly - absolutely zero slop , and i really like not having to worry about keeping up with more than one case . also , at $ 29.95 , it 's cheaper than the two-case approach . the only criticism i have of this jacket is that when you want to convert from belt clip to sport use you have to snake the band through two loops on the backside of the case and over the little plastic belt clip receiver that protrudes from the back of the case . the process is a little tedious , but the end result is great . the unit feels very secure on my arm and it 's easy to forget that it 's there . this jacket is a winner
elec	this is a nice product , i buught it beacause i needed to play dvds from foreign country and my fancy `` sony '' dvd vcr player ca n't read them but this little thing can , it reads all the standards i 'm glad i 've got it .
elec	the card worked fine for my son 's graduation and a family holiday but became corrupted during my brother 's wedding and i lost all the photos from that event . i still ca n't believe it happened . if you have an ipod , or other , remember to back-up your photos as soon as you can to try and avoid this
elec	this is a very good sounding sub for the price . i compared others at higher prices and liked how this produced a full range to compliment the other speakers . it fills a 1500 sq ft room with cathedral ceiling very well . i would buy another
elec	i bought this samsung model in september because of the superior picture and excellent glare reduction . it went black the day before the super bowl . it is now ncaa playoffs and it has not been repaired or replaced . the service technician has tried 3 times to repair , now having replaced every component . i am finally on a replacement list with no eta . the samsung customer service reps have been unhelpful and unconcerned . the repair technician is the only person who has apologised and tried to push samsung - with no success
elec	after receiving this drum which was listed as having a 25,000 yield capacity , on 12/11/06 ... .today 1/15/07 my printer is giving me the same error message `` drum near end '' there was no indication when i purchased this product that it would be refurbished..i certainly have not printed 25,000 copies ...
elec	i ordered this antenna to enhance the reception of the uhf channels . i live in a big city and i thought i should n't have a problem with any indoor antenna . it seems i was mistaken . this antenna is useless . it is almost no better than my previous 99 cents store antenna
elec	why do i get the feeling that some of these later reviews were written by kensington people ? the fact is , this light has some unique features that most usb lights do n't , including an on/off switch and two brightness levels . however , that does n't come close to overcoming the drawbacks . first of all , the price is way too high for what you are getting . also , the brightness difference between four and eight leds is negligible . but the biggest flaw in this light , by far , is that the flexible arm is not nearly strong enough to support the weight of the lamp . i have had to resort to clamping the arm to the side of my monitor , which is just plain ridiculous . for the price they are getting , they should have produced a more durable product
elec	i do n't know where the guy below got that this card does n't work with windows media center edition because i just installed the latest xp drivers for the card on media center edition 2005 and it works perfectly . i sold my gigaport ag to get this because of the much better signal/noise ratio that the firewire audiophile has and it made a big difference . very clean sound ! i use it to dj with using mixvibes , using the asio drivers and it works beautifully ! a great buy to say the least ... pick one up , you wont regret it
elec	does not consistently work ! i have a toshiba a15 ( win xp pro ) and sometimes this works , but usually it does n't . lately , it either works perfectly or it gives me a blue screen error and restarts the computer . it used to have problems where i would restart the computer and it would say card not found , which forced me to reload the driver . but lately it 's just been giving me a blue screen . i have used pcmcia cards before and never once had any issues . d-link needs to support their faulty product with a new driver ! bad customer service ! i will never buy a d-link product again ! !
elec	i got this product when i first signed up to telewest broadband and it has never failed . i have had it for 2 years and not a problem . i started at 512kbps and they 've upgraded me to 4mbps and it handles that speed without a problem . perfect for your light , moderate or heavy user , good all-rounder . thanks for reading :
elec	this is the correct ink for my printer . i do not buy lower priced substitutes . it was great to find this on amazon at a good price and eligible for free shipping . i only wish amazon stocked the complete set of inks for this printer which i purchased from them .
elec	the card works as advertised but sandisk does not send in mail-in-rebate . even though i mailed it in with the upc barcode , sandisk sent me a post card stating that i needed to resubmit it with the barcode . how can i resubmit when they already have the barcode ? in my experience with sandisk , i got rebate back on one of two cards that i submitted - so you get mail-in rebate 50 % of the time with sandisk . i think mail-in-rebate is a big hoax perpetrated by these companies . do n't trust it !
elec	i am surprised there are not more reviews on how ridiculous the prices are ! i really did enjoy the ease of tivo from pre-hd days and wanted to go back from my comcast hd dvr . i then saw the pricetag and , unlike the other people ... i can not justify spending that much money for a dvr ! it is definitely not worth it for something i get for $ 8 extra a month attached to my cable service . yes ... i do love the tivo interface and searching , but i will not pay that much for it . it feels like business suicide for tivo to want to sell that product at a ridiculous price . knock $ 700 dollars off that retail price and i might change my mind
elec	our oskar multimedia storage cabinet arrived in a timely manner and was in very good condition . my husband assembled the unit with ease , until it was time to nail the card board backing on . following the instructions he laid the unit down on it 's face , of course the kick-board had already been added so it did n't lay flat . when nailing on the backing the `` j '' board ( the center shelf holding the entire unit together ) split at every point of contact . we had ordered our oskar storage cabinet through amazon , directly from ritz camera . so , naturally i called ritz to replace the `` j '' shelf . i was informed i would have to return the entire unit . i immediately pictured myself trying to get all those shelves back into the box and figured that was more trouble than i wanted to go through . so , i tracked down the number for oskar and called them directly . they were very efficient and helpful . within minutes i had their assurance that they would ship a new `` j '' shelf to my home - at no additional charge . the shelf arrived within the promised ten-days . this unit was exactly what we ordered and works well for it 's intended purpose . i would caution you to be very careful nailing on the backboard , so as not to split the center shelf . my favorite feature of the oskar multimedia wood storage cabinet is that they include plenty of extra shelves , unlike so many other brands . i have an entire stack of shelves that i can add as needed . i would love to have three or four more of these units .
elec	bad customer service its been almost a month and i still have not received this product . ive sent 3 emails and called twice noone really helped me with anything , neither did anyone answer the phones . i dont even know how to rate the item because i dont have it . im pretty sure its really nice its just ive been waiting for almost a month and this is getting frustrating with no help
elec	i wanted to be able to shoot lots over several days without dragging a laptop with me through multiple airports . i bought two and both worked fine , right out of the box . not the fastest card ever , but certainly large storage for the price
elec	the price and some positive reviews led me to purchase this item , but after only about 1,000 pictures , all i got was corrupted data . i had the card professionally tested to ensure it was the card and nothing wrong with my camera . it definitely showed the card was the problem . luckily , i had recently done a download . wo n't trust my pictures to this brand again
elec	i bought this slick looker for the desk in my office . i had a beat up 20 yo digital clock radio that had poor sound.however its tuner worked ok and i figured with the tivoli rep i 'd get some good listening along with the good looks . my office is inside the facility without windows so reception can be tricky ... the tuner for the pa speakers in the rest of the office has to have the antenna just right . i was very frustrated to find that the radio simply couldnt hold a signal . a station would tune in nice but the fade in and out to barely hearable . i bought an amplified antenna but didnt help . then i tried it in a windowed room and same problem ... ... i was very disapointed
elec	i do all my burning on a standard windows media player , and it 's almost entirely data and music , no video . for my purposes , these cd 's sound great . in some cases , it actually seems like the discs have enhanced the sound spectrum somewhat . that may be a trick my ears are playing on me but , nevertheless , i 'm a big fan of the memorex . and they 're a steal if you catch the sale price . recommended
elec	i did n't purchase this one ... it was a gift . i was hoping for a laser printer like one of the brother all-in-ones . i opted to install the lite version of the software from hp.com . i would suggest that everyone do this . the lite version only has the drivers , none of the hp bull software that is included usually . the thing that bothered me the most was the automatic document feeder . i would start a scan job and everything is going fine , and then on the 5th or 6th page the whole process would just hang . i had over 500 pages of documents to scan , and this machine really let me down . amazing how hewlett-packard ca n't even write reliable drivers . i gave the item 2 stars because i got it to print sometimes . no buy
elec	wow , how i can write a review about the item i have not received so far . i ordered this case on march 7th and to day is april 10th and it seems out of stock so far.well , i , m still waiting ... ... ..
elec	this router functions great in the household environment . it is very easy to install and security is equally as easy to set .
elec	i bought this humidifier reading the reviews here . but when i actually used for a few days , i found that it provided no relief from dryness while sleeping or during the day . it pretty much did nothing except make the room hotter . i would not recommend this to anyone
elec	let 's be honest . this product ai n't cheap . it 's not something you can just throw away if it decides to stop working . i bought mine at cpenusa.com . delivery was great , only took them a couple of days . however , my c-pen cable was damaged . the connector to the c-pen was , for some reason , cut in half . without it , you ca n't recharge or connect the c-pen to the pc . i called their main office all the way in sweden during the office hours . no response . i sent three e-mails to cpenusa . no response . i do n't care if the product itself is great ( i 'll never know now , will i.. ) . if you 're unable to receive support when you need 'em , you 're screwed . if you 're just interested in electronic equipments , just want to try things out and do n't really care if you 're on your own , go ahead and try it . let me know how this thing really is . otherwise , buy a product that you can trust on with respect to after-sales support
elec	i 've had two rm-ez2 for over a year now ( on different tvs ) ... very satisfactory indeed . pro : -very smooth action , easy to press buttons , fine for big clumsy fingers and poor eyesight -always works without fussy pointing -good battery life con : -eventually one will accidentally depress the wrong cbl or tv button and wonder why the remote no longer works ... the cure is simple , just depress the correct button , but if you forget that they are there , you might think the remote is broken - it 's not , it 's you . -there seems to be no way to generate the code to put your tv into setup mode - so do n't throw away the manufacturer 's original remote if you ever want to put the tv into setup mode
elec	we received this item very quickly . it was exactly what we ordere
elec	cases very cheaply made . break when opening . not worth shipping cost waste of money
elec	it 's been over 19 days since my sandisk 512mb transflash card was `` shipped '' from emartbuy and i still have not received my order . when i contacted emartcrap , all they could tell me was that it had been shipped . i am sure that flash card works great . i just hope that i will receive it before it becomes obsolete . avoid emartbuy at all cost . do n't settle for incompetency . your are better off paying a higher price for better service ... correction any service
elec	i have always bought and liked uniden phones . tried this one based on consumer reports recommendation and because i wanted caller id . awful reception - too much background noise and you can not hear the person on the other line . turn the volume to high and you get feedback from your own voice . good range ( which is useful in finding the perfectly quite place in your house to finish your call ! ) . stay clear ! ! ! ! ! !
elec	the minor problem is that the user manual claims the user id is `` admin '' . well , it is not . frustration and wasted time will occur until you somehow find out that the user id should be left blank to log in . the major problem is that the unit only works for twelve to 36 hours before it has be rebooted . after twelve to 36 hours it looses the connection to the wireless network . once you unplug and plug back the power cord , it will work fine for another twelve to 36 hours . i am used to rebooting windows every time it hangs , but i do n't accept having a wireless access point that hangs ( i am not sure how microsoft was able to convince me it is ok for an os to hang ) . this box is going back . i already bought a buffalo that works fine
elec	i bought a pv-d4744 about a year ago , it worked for a while , now it wo n't read old disks and , even with brand new disks , the chance of it being able to read the disk are not good , about 90 % of the brand new disks i have tried it wo n't read . i will never buy another panasonic product again .
elec	excellent machine , great performance saved lot of time and desk space . great scanning speed and qualit
elec	very very loud-enough to make you 're ears ring ( thats a good sign ) bass is very deep and the silver volume dots on one of the speakers are touch sensitive like the ipod-now thats cool . great great desktop speakers , and they can hook up right to your ipod . worth the money
elec	this battery will transform your epson picturemate deluxe viewer edition from a nifty little photo printer into an absolute must have item ! i take it with me when ever i 'm doing an off-site photo shoot , or even when i 'm out for a weekend shooting candids . the portability you get by adding this battery to the printer is priceless . i have printed as many as 40 photos on one charge .
elec	my title is my review . the thing worked for a week . after that it would n't power up anymore . chinese junk
elec	i did the research on this product and it was one of the best . i do n't know that to be true due to the fact that the software that they sent me was a demo version that was outdated for use . i have to buy another software package to opperate the product that had stated in the description that the software was included . one if not the only reason i had purchased it . i e-mailed tiger.com and received no reply . if your going to sell something false advertisement is not the way
elec	this product looks and feels very flimsy . do not be fooled by the flashy , metallic-looking picture . the plastic shell of this device is the quality of mcdonald 's toys . one would think that for $ 300 , the company would at least commission a manufacturer that did not leave plastic whiskers hanging off the rims due to bad cutting . the buttons are hard to press . in order to turn the device on , you have to press very firmly , which is a risky thing to do considering the cracking delicacy of the shell . the cable port for the docupen is also extremely flimsy , and you have to hold the cable firmly in place in order for the downloads to take place ; otherwise , the connection will be lost . i am a pre-medical student , and i very stupidly invested a lot of money in this product , believing that i could ( for 8 seconds a page and 100 pages per disk ) scan my science textbooks in the library , including the colored diagrams , and in that way , i thought i would make back my investment , since textbooks go for at least $ 100 each . however , i now see that this belief was naive , to say the least . the docupen is extremely difficult to use . the words come out distorted , like a jammed fax machine , and although the free paper port software which comes complimentary with the docupen is rather useful for annotating pdf 's , the docupen does not produce texts that are legible enough to annotate . furthermore , downloading is very slow ( at least 15 seconds per page on my fast computer ) , and since you ca n't see how your scans have turned out until you load them into the computer , you will have to re-scan about 80 % of pages due to stretches , smudges , blurriness , suspicious blank spots , and general illegibility . i wish i had read some of the other negative amazon reviews before buying this product . i would have saved myself a lot of money and time . if you are a user who is only looking to scan pictures or a few flat documents , then this product may work okay for you , although a digital camera will probably deliver better results . if you have been harboring grandiose visions of going all-out `` paperless '' with this product , you will find yourself extremely disappointed . until planon decides that this product is worthy enough to invest in a semi-decent shell manufacturuer , it will not a good buy . the idea is wonderful and has a lot of potential , especially when coupled with a tablet pc . however , the execution of the idea needs improvement . i hope to see a far better version of this product in the next few years , at a price that is comparable to quality .
elec	this remote controller was quite a dissapointment . i am using two other philips/magnavox remotes that are far more convenient and operate better . this one does not look like the picture ( which looks more like the 425 model ) . it does not cover the equipment i have ( while the 425 model does ) , it 's learning mode is flaky and unreliable , to say the least . the range is shorter then that of the 425s . conclusion : this would make for a nice ornament ( it does look nice , and , if you are lucky you may be able to control some devices .
elec	great memory card for the price . i would highly recommen
elec	i have a dcs-900w camera that failed within a year . after that , i made 7 calls to their customer service and tried to get it returned and replaced . obviously i was talking to some indian people overseas that do n't seem to care about the `` service '' that much , and usually after a couple of transfers , the line got cut off or picked up by another layman . during conversation , the line quality is very bad . after a while , i just decided that $ 100 camera is not worth the time of the calls . i am in the process of reporting their practice to the better business bureau . based on my experience , i would be reluctant to buy any expensive things from d-link . once you have any problem , they just wo n't honor the waranty
elec	my wife dropped the original remote and it quite working . it turns out there are pcb 's inside and one surface mount connector to the other board came loose so i resoldered it and it worked for a little while , probably until the next time she dropped it . i bought the updated remote and one drop was all it took to disable the receive part of it also . could not find the problem this time . it still transmitted , but eventually quit transmitting after the alarm was on . i unlocked the truck manually and every time someone opened or closed a door the alarm would go off and i could not start the truck . i messed with it ( while in the parking lot of an amusment park ) for a long time and evetually got it to stop , probably by entering valet mode , i 'm not sure . do n't waste your money on another $ 100 remote . i am shopping for a remote that is transmit only without the lcd . should be more reliable . my suggestion is to buy a system that comes with 2 remotes : one lcd and one simple . better yet , buy a system that does not have the feedback , or 2 way , and save a lot of money and headache . you wo n't use it anyway
elec	i have had my handspring visor deluxe for 5 ... yes , five years ( actually longer ) . while i take decent care of it , it has taken care of me . my doctor has one too ... exactly like mine and we often talk about how perhaps they should be replaced , but the darn thing is still working great and does everything we need it to . i finally ordered a new pda with all the capabilities of my laptop and am passing this one on to someone else who needs it . ( i 'm not selling it ... good karma ) down to business - the handspring visor deluxe is not the creme de la creme anymore . but in its day it was . great product and if you do n't need the bells and whistles ( or color display ) ... go for this . totally flawless . people often complain about the styli of other pdas . no complaints here . not only is it relatively comfortable , it is stainless tipped with plastic on both ends ( does n't break ) and it stays securely in place when you store it in the device . i literally lost my original stylus just a few days ago . the display is not as easy to read as the new super crisp glossy screens that are out now , but if you need a basic device with a few bells and whistles that are thrown in for fun ( heck , a good deal of the new ones do n't have ir ) ... go for it . and for the price i just saw it listed for on amazon ( $ 85 ) it 's a total steal . great product
elec	great sound . fun colored lights . great design . love this radio
elec	this is n't a consistent product . 99 % of the time , i ca n't get it to work . after months of emails and phone calls , customer service responded . what a joke ! they told me the plug in the unit and then unplug , wait 30 seconds , and then plug in . gim me a break ! i should n't have to do the hokie pokie just to get it to work . by the way , their process did n't work . poor product , poor customer service , poor price
elec	very easy to assemble , has very classic lines , lets stereo equipment have plenty of ventilation , hard to find add-on shelf in maple . holds a lot of equipment
elec	i just received these and popped 'em in and i 'm listening to mp3s on my pc . at first , one of sides was really weak in volume . in the process of testing the balance in my software , i accidentally cranked up the volume way to high for these guys , but that apparently did the trick . now both are equal , and sound good . there is decent bass , but the highs are a bit soft . a quick tweak to my equalizer , and they 're great . after reading several of the reviews on amazon , i was a bit worried about the sound , but now that i have them i 'm very happy . they 're a good price , and sooooo much better than the little ipod-like earbuds i 've tried before . those never stayed in my ear , and the bass never made me happy . summary : these jbuds stay in my ear , have good sound ( not great , but i think good for $ 20 ) , and have equal length cords from each ear
elec	this is a piece of junk . the radio reception is terrible . fm is marginal and am is almost nonexistent .
elec	with all the reviews about how easy the nano scratches , i left the protective film on until i found the right case the next day at cc ( they had just received them that day ) , sorry amazon but the nano did come from you . anyway the case is certainly up to the standard of the nano itself . it comes with a peel off protective strip that fits over the screen itself . i have noticed the click wheel was a little slow to respond with the shipping film on it , but since when this case is open the click wheel is directly accessible , it works great . it fits snugly in this case , yet is easy to remove though removal is not necessary to charge or update . the case has a felt inner lining which seems protect it and may provide some shock protection in case of falls . i have used it daily for 2 weeks with no scratches at all . the belt clip is sturdy and secure . the magnetic snap for closing it works great . the case can be closed with headphones attached , but of course to make adjustments it has to be opened which is easily done while on the belt clip as it unfolds to allow easy access . this case is as cool as the nano itself and i would very highly recommend it . i hope belkin makes the same case for the new ipod
elec	well i got these headphones and connected them and realized when it played the front center channel i only got sound from the front left speaker . then the rear right channel did n't work at all . after calling tigerdirect to see about a refund . the first customer service rep was rude and unwilling to help . said we had to ship it back to them in the orginal big brown ups box with all the extra millions of packing peanuts . after getting the management on the phone they were more willing to help but its not enough . the headphones feel cheap and the wires are not color coded like everyone else uses . the instructions are lacking and the speakers that did work in them did n't sound that good at all
elec	i got this for christmas 2004 . played 5 dvd 's on it and started to get the `` no disk '' reading . i only had it for 1 month . i sent it back and they are replacing it since it is under warranty but they are replacing it with a different model . we will see if it has the same problems . according to reviews of the 1700m model i expect the same . i suggest you spend a little more money and get a better dvd player
elec	unit installed in seconds with no false starts or headaches of any kind . the base is wide and heavy and when placed on a mouse pad does n't move around at all , even when i get a little too `` into '' my flight sim games . one ca n't beat the price either . for flying prop planes , i am very saisfied with the performance
elec	i bought this like a ipod but its better i have about 20 movies on it and about 500 songs and some photo 's and still have 50 gigs left . the only hang up is you still have to go pay another 20.00 to get the plug-in download that lets you show most of the movies . they say it can do all this stuff but not with out downloads and some add on 's once you get all that there are hours of fun to be had .
elec	this product is not worth the money or trouble . i also had problem with bubbles forming and also the sides curing up as my notebook warmed up . it was too much bother to keep trying to smooth out the bubbles and press down the sides after curling back up . save your money and do n't buy this . this would actually qualify for a zero star rating
elec	functionally , the ifm is great . i like to use it for workouts at the gym to watch fm transmitted tv 's . however , the construction is extremely cheap . i bought two of them and both fell apart . one fell apart the second time i used it . the construction is so cheap that i could n't put it back together because the controls do n't line up . i wish there was an alternative but i ca n't find one . i like being able to switch between ipod tunes and fm , but will have to carry two devices from now on
elec	great headphones for running ! they fit my ears perfectly and i do n't have to worry about foam anymore .
elec	i almost bought a new phone because it was not working . the ability to purchase this battery saved me some bucks
dvd	... but buyers should be forwarned that the print from which this dvd is made was a poor one , and alpha video , the distributors of this classic capra movie , made no attempt to clean it up . here we have an example of a key artwork about america 's psychological and political framework during emergence from the economic depression of the 1930s , crying out for careful restration to the condition it so deserves
dvd	the royal tenenbaums is wes anderson 's third major motion picture . the movie revolves around a rich , but extremely eccentric man name royal tenenbaum ( gene hackman ) . royal and his wife etheline ( angelica huston ) had three children : chas ( ben stiller ) , margot ( gwyneth paltrow ) , and richie ( luke wilson ) . in the 1970s the tenenbaums were one of america 's premier families : margot was a famous playwright , richie was a junior tennis champion who later won three consecutive u.s. nationals , and chas started his first real estate business at an early age earning himself his first million dollars before he was thirteen . that was almost thirty years ago and the tenenbaums have largely been forgotten . betrayal , failure , and disaster have haunted the family and the laurels of their youthful days have withered and died . what 's worse is that royal 's children and wife blame him for all their failures . royal senses that his time is earth is waning and he wishes to set things right . with the assistance of his faithful servant and lifelong friend , pagoda ( kumar pallana ) , royal sets into motion a plan to redeem himself in his family 's eyes . i 'm a pretty big fan of wes anderson and have seen all four of his films . the royal tenenbaums is anderson 's most critically acclaimed and his most popular picture . however , it is my least favorite of his movies . like all anderson films the movie is filled with quirky characters and witty dialogue . the film is about the redemption of a man in the eyes of his family , a theme that i enjoy . yet , the film just did n't resonate with me as much as anderson 's other pictures . i really do n't know why that is . that 's not to say the royal tenenbaums is a bad movie because it 's not . in addition to everything else mention it also has some good acting , brilliant set designs , etc . i just prefer a movie about thieve brothers or a film about a precocious teenage genius or comic-drama about a sea-voyaging documentarian instead
dvd	this film is boring , so much so that i could only take 35 minutes of it before i was forced to push stop . this is a soap opera about politics oil companies . it 's weird jump around style is confusing pointless ... do yourself a favor and do n't bother w/ this garbage
dvd	my daughter was shown this movie in her public school classroom several times while she was in grade school . it was n't until years later that i saw it , and i was horrified ! ! ! this was a movie aimed at children ? ? ? what does a children 's movie need a sexy bunny for ? the lead female character was a very sexy bunny wearing skimpy clothing and `` strutting her stuff '' on the basketball court in a very provocative manner , until the male characters were panting , drooling , and clawing their way after her like a bunch of sick , depraved perverts . this scene was highly innapropriate for children , and is not the idea of womanhood that should be shown to boys or girls . not only that , the idea was put forward that only a fortune teller with a crystal ball was able to discern the truth about what happened to the players abilities . this movie should be kept far , far away from children , and was truly deserving of zero stars
dvd	of course dead alive was the better movie . but i think the comparisons to the peter jackson masterpiece are appropriate , due to the fact that there is a high body count , lots of over-the-top splattery deaths , and annoying partygoers that end up as zombie killers , some as zombie lunch . apparently there was some footage cut out for this release . i 'm not sure if that was gore footage or not , but i would think gorehounds would like this one due to the overwhelming amount of onscreen violence . there is even some non-gore `` grossout '' humor ( vomit-related , etc . ) that reminded me of bad taste as well as dead alive . sorry to run the peter jackson comparison into the ground , but again the influence is unquestionable . do n't expect the fx quality of dead alive though , this looked lower budget and some scenes were a little too dark to make out everything clearly . i do n't know if this was the way the original film was shot or if it was the print/transfer , but it 's a minor distraction . they did a great job with a relatively small budget . i echo the other reviewers who would like to see ittenbach 's other films on us ( hopefully uncut ) dvd release -- i 've heard burning moon is especially crazy
dvd	this is an excellent film , which unfortunately has not been given a decent treatment by the distributor . i was very disapointed in the quality of the release- the picture quality is poor , inter-titles appear to be missing , and the score which has been added is just a repetition of long synth chords that do n't match the action on-screen . it 's a shame , because a film like this one deserves much better
dvd	while i absolutely love the show on pbs , this season was mispackaged . the box and dvd were both labeled series 3 , but when you view it the episodes are exactly the same as series 1/2 . unfortunately , i did n't try watching this disc until several months after i bought it . if you buy this , be sure you view it promptly to be certain it 's the correct series
dvd	even though i am not a streisand fan , i was astonished at just how dopey and annoying this movie was . the plot is supposed to revolve around a big change in appearance for streisand 's character , making her attractive - no , irresistible - to the main male character . the problem is , she looks almost exactly the same before and after the makeover ! somebody ( probably streisand ) thinks that highlighted hair , a tight black cocktail dress , and a baggy-lipped smirk are irresistible whereas a pink bridesmaid dress , casual clothes , and everyday looks are disgusting . baaaaaamp ! ( that 's the fallacy alarm going off : men , in my experience , do n't care much about clothes and makeup . ) there was a lot of emphasis placed on the streisand character 's losing weight by riding an exercise bike , but she looked exactly the same afterward - no detectable weight difference ! yet truly , the low point of the movie is the scene in which streisand , discussing her baby and early-childhood photos with her mother ( played by lauren bacall ) , blubbers , `` wazz i a pretty baby ? wazz i a pretty babyyyyeeee ? '' in that one scene , streisand 's neuroticism concerning her looks is fully revealed . the whole movie is about this issue , and it 's amazing that an entire cast , crew , and production company would devote themselves to b.s . 's emotional issues like that . i really think that the `` funny girl '' phenomenon somehow ruined streisand 's thought processes . the media buzz about her at the time was that she was kind of cute despite being light-years away from the stereotyped , northern european beauty standard of the time ( think grace kelly ; think ingrid bergman ... .. ) . i recall reading about how her glowing complexion , thick hair , and good figure ( as well as her energy and voice ) carried her through despite her looks : long nose , large lips , slanted eyes . myself , i think she looks like an egyptian princess or similar ; but she certainly does n't look like grace kelly ... .. so why ca n't she accept this ? the majority of us women , whatever our race , color , or bone-structure , learn to live with and love who we are ... ..at least i hope we do ! this movie is not about that . this movie says that you have to have a certain dress and hairdo to be desirable . maybe i should 've given it only one star
dvd	'fais-moi des vacances ' ( we need a vacation ) is a finely wrought little film that studies the disparities between the classes in france while introducing us to a warmly tender and humorous friendship between two young lads . directed and written by didier bivel ( with writing assistance from djamila djabri ) it offers a slice of life we rarely see - that underbelly of france 's projects where mixed races strive to exist without the amenities of those with means who surround their neighborhoods . lucien ( aymen saïdi ) lives with his father ( bernard blancan ) , mother ( hiam abbass ) , young sister pamela ( laura mas navarro ) , and his tough streetwise older brother josé ( nabil el bouhairi ) in a small flat . close by is his african friend adama ( ibrahim koma ) and his equally poor family of father ( makan fofana ) , mother ( marie-philomène nga ) and sister fanta ( hawa yakaré sissoko ) . as school ends the kids whose families have money take them on a vacation , a state neither lucien nor adama can afford despite their obsession with that luxury . the two boys manipulate funds and ideas and ultimately come up with the idea of secretly jumping aboard a ruv of a family headed for the beach . but despite the success of their plan and the encouragement of the daughter of the van 's owners , the boys end up not at the beach but at a nudist camp , a fact that makes them flee ! upon returning home both boys ' families punish their activities and when lucien seeks comfort from his older brother , josé beats him and tells him to grow up . in the end the boys finagle their way to the beach , but of course by this time vacation time is over and they are on an empty beach re-evaluating their lives . the cast is uniformly strong , the writing is excellent , and the camera work not only captures the claustrophobia of the projects but also opens up the vistas of the boys ' imaginations . it is a fine little film , one deserving of a wide audience . grady harp , january 07
dvd	so this was the breakout movie for mira sorvino , the one that earned her an academy award for best supporting actress in 1995 . this movie , and mira sorvino 's performance in it , was so bad that after it was over , i just had to find out who her competitors were for the 1995 best supporting actress category . let 's see ... ..according to wikipedia they were : kathleen quinlin ( `` apollo 13 '' - a fairly standard worried-wife-of-astronaut-in-danger role ) , mare winningham ( `` georgia '' - did not see this one ) , joan allen ( `` nixon '' - did not see , but how hard can it be to play the wooden pat nixon ? ) , and kate winslet ( `` sense and sensibilities '' - did not see either , but ang lee was robbed by the academy here also ) . it only proves just how few good roles there are for women in today 's hollywood that mira sorvino could win an oscar for this sort of performance . and i was beginning to warm up to her , too - she was great in `` romy and michele 's high school reunion '' , and terrific also in `` beautiful girls '' . so , what exactly is so bad about this movie ? here 's a brief list : 1 . mira sorvino plays the entire movie in a high-pitched falsetto that sounds like her voice is breaking . another reviewer described this as similar to listening to fingernails on a blackboard . maybe in 1995 , because she was new , the academy did n't realize that this was n't her real voice and took pity on her ... . 2 . stupid plot device of the greek chorus . 3 . stupid happy ending with a twist . 4 . lots of profanity and dialogue that includes explicit descriptions of sex acts done in pornography movies ... ..while this movie is not itself a porn flick , the explicit details of the porn industry included in the dialogue definitely makes it not a movie for families to watch . 5 . odd sight of a very old and wrinkly woody allen ( with dyed hair and bald spot ) making out with two women young enough to be his granddaughters ... ..all right , so i 'm just jealous - woody still looks gross ... . 6 . cliched , poorly developed characters , a plotline that goes around in circles , and lots and lots of pointless , unfunny dialogue . in summary , this movie is bad , bad , bad ... ...
dvd	robert redford has proved us his undeniable artistic gifts in previous occasions , but with this giant movie he really achieved that coveted pearl ; the state of art in all its wholeness . redford crossed over the traditional concessions and he got to prove art and cinema should not be divorced : good taste and profitability may gather and shake hands , if you respect the sensibility and intelligence of the spectator . this picture not only broke the walls and not only became the most ambitious , artistic and perfect american film in the last quarter of century ; besides , the mature and sensitive script around an awful event that will transform the livings and expand the reduced frontiers of two different ways of life , enhancing them when the tragedy became an unexpected gate for the bliss . redford ' s artistic personality has a secure place in the immortality and i really hope for him to bring us future films filled of that enriched vision where the rude vulgarity , the visible special effects big circus and the simple anecdote not only be absent ; and so the new directors to come , understand the true cinema meaning is art . thanks to his generous personal effort , for having created the sundance festival for new directors whose fruits will create new approaches and major visions . special kudos to him due that clinical eye for a very young actress in progress at those years : scarlet johansson .
dvd	-not a great one here , entertaining for all the wrong reasons , mainly because the film is so bad , so often . -it is nice to see christina ricci in a movie again , as she 's usually good even in a bad movie and does n't do too bad here . -wes craven directs this one and i could tell right away it must have been do to a contract obligation ( much like edward norton in `` the italian job '' ) . i could tell this because very little effort seemed to be put into the script , both the story and lines of dialogue were very predictable and dumb . also very little effort seemed to be put into the effects , as they were very lousy at times , especially when they finally showed the werewolf . -as i said before , quite predictable the story was , both ricci and her brother get bitten by a werewolf after they try to save a girl who got into a car wreck . then both try to figure out what 's wrong with them , though the brother is much more active about it than ricci . -it 's also quite obvious who the main werewolf was , the film tries a bit of a swerve , but it does n't really work . -besides ricci , the cast includes shannon elizabeth ( american pie 12 ) , portia de rossi ( arrested development ) , joshua jackson ( pacey on `` dawson 's creek '' ) , scott baio ( do n't ask me why ) among others . all do pretty poor jobs , besides ricci that is , the rest do n't really seem to care , not that i blame them that is . -there is some humor throughout the film , but a lot of the film will get unintentional laughs from those who watch it . -the only reason to watch this is to make fun of it as the effort is not really there by mostly anybody on the cast or crew .
dvd	eric maibus and scott bairstow have become fine young actors , and even their adequate performances can not save this dismal , pointless , lurid and sadistic movie . dee wallace stone should be ashamed for participating . maibus plays the hypnotic leader of a teenage devil cult , with no conscience , morals , or regard for anyone but himself ; bairstow plays the usual `` misunderstood '' teen who looks to the group for acceptance . the script is laden with offensive four letter words in every other sentence ; enough is enough . if this is the way teens talk , then steer me clear , folks . there is no heart or soul in this movie , and no reason to rent or buy . no stars . c'mon amazon , when you gon na give us the 0 stars options ? ?
dvd	the economy , austerity and directness of the films of fritz lang made him one of the most profound , and precise filmmakers ... lang , a master of the german expressionist film , shot his first talkie , a crime drama considered a landmark in the story of suspense movies ... it was a shocking idea for its time , based on the real-life killer peter kurten , headlined as the vampire of düsseldorf ... 'm ' is about a terrorized city , and a plump little man with wide eyes ( often chewing candy ) who is a pathological child-killer , unable to control his urge for killing ... the film embodies several lang themes : the duality between justice and revenge , mob hysteria , the menacing anticipation of watching a helplessly trapped individual trying fruitlessly to escape as greater forces move inexorably in , and , for probably the first time in the cinema , it adds a new dimension to suspense : pity ... for the killer is clearly mentally sick ... he can not overcome the overwhelming compulsion of his murderous disease , and yet , we see him hunted down and almost lynched as a criminal , rather than treated as a sick man ... early in the film , the killer is heard whistling the grieg theme from 'in the hall of the mountain king ' . this theme inexorably becomes imbued with menace ... and when we see no more than a girl looking in a shop window , the melody on the sound-track told us chillingly that the murderer is there , just out of sight ... the murderer is played by peter lorre in a virtuoso performance that has barely been matched in all the thrillers he has made since 'casablanca , ' 'the maltese falcon , ' and 'the mask of dimitrios . ' when the photographs of his victims , all little girls , are shown to him , he jumps back and twitches with horror ... with powerful visuals , lang 's motion picture is lorre 's first film ... his performance as the corpulent , hunted psychopath is a masterpiece of mime and suggestion ... lorre is the archetypal outsider-outside the law and society because of his compulsive crimes , outside the balancing society of the underworld because he is not a professional criminal ... he had only twelve lines of dialog ... in the most famous of all about a pathological killer - alfred hitchcock 's 'psycho ' - anthony perkins lacked not only the threat of the tortured peter lorre , but also the dimension of invoking our incredulous sympathy ... 'psycho ' reeked with blood and horror , whereas the suspense of 'm ' is subtle ... a child 's balloon without an owner , a rolling ball , are enough to tell us that another murder had been committed ... the audience , trapped in its seats , torn by ambivalent feelings towards the killer , watched him trapped as the net is pulled tight ...
dvd	i have read many reviews stating that this remake is inferior to the orginal version of 1968 . granted , that version is marvelous . i have bought both versions and love them both . ok , it is difficult not to compare when watching . but i ca n't help wondering : if this version would have been the first i or anybody watched instead of the 1968 version , if people would have been complaining about that version ? i can have different versions of vivaldi 's four seasons ca n't i ? actually for those among us who love classical music and opera it is quite common to have several versions of the same musical piece and enjoy them all ( and i do understand that people can have preferences for one or the other ) . we would never say this or that piece is a remake of that version , would we ? i have gone to the opera numerous times and watched don giovanni three times . every time with different performers . remake ? absolutely not . i think that the only reason one would have made this version of lion in winter is the wish to make it , because is such a great play . so , logically this would not be a remake ! why ca n't we watch this version for what it is and let go of the other ( splendid 1968 ) version when doing so ? that done , i must say i understand why alais is in love with king henry . patrick stewart is a very fine actor and has magnificent voice which he uses very well . he is a very good match to close 's queen . i did not care for richard , i thought he was not commanding enough , bit whiny . i think john is a difficult part to play to say the least and i did n't care for him either , too much the idiot . geoffrey on the other hand is really conniving and very good . king philippe : too much a boy , although he has moments when the interaction with king henry makes him interesting . alais : good enough . which of the versions do i prefer ? that is difficult . i have highly enjoyed both . i think the 1968 version has a sharper edge because of hepburn and i prefer her to close . this version has a more emotional and sometimes romantic ( alais and henry ) approach . i definitely prefer stewart to o'toole , who seemed too young for the role . i liked the way stewart made us see henry 's self confindence in his plans and his pleasure in manipulating and scheming ( that is , until the end , when things turn out the wrong way and you see hem falling apart ) . o'toole had a very serious approach all the time . on the other hand : anthony hopkins and timothy dalton were both splendid . i think overall that the 1968 version has a better supporting cast . which of the versions i watch , depends on the mood i am in . i think they are both good in their own way .
dvd	to be honest with you i thought the movie was really bad . the acting was ok but the only good part about the movie was that ricky ( rodney eastman ) was in the movie . ( for about 5 mins ) but i would not suggest renting this movie and waisting 4 dollars
dvd	`` modigliani '' ( 2004 ) is a self-indulgent , pretentious and largely fictional portrait of a tragic artist . writer-director mick davis goes overboard on the symbolism while revealing precious little about the man and his work . ironically , the viewer has a better understanding of pablo picasso than amedeo modigliani . despite his boundless enthusiasm , andy garcia is simply too old for the title role . an irritating fiasco that deserved its straight-to-video fate
dvd	much of the plot has been outlined above , as well as the cast and i am , in large part , in complete agreement with the positive reveiws recorded . i want to add that , for anyone raised on the old universal horror pictures , or the films directed by james whale or val lewton , where the suspense is the important part of the film ; this picture , shadows and fog , has this quality absolutely dripping from every frame ! despite the comedic elements ( and there are many funny things happening ) the tension rises perceptibly throughout the narrative . the climax is dissapointing for many , but if you follow the subtext of this extremely philosophical script it is nearly a perfect resolution in all ways . i have had philosophy students who were struggling with concepts of 19th and 20th century writers watch this movie and instantly gain insight into the point of the often times obtuse oblique writings of hegel , kant and the like . i beleive that the unpopularity of the this film is based on people thinking that they were about to see bananas or sleeper . love him or hate him , you have to admit , woody allen is deep . a personal favorite film of mine , but definetly not everybodies cup of philosophicallly comedic tea
dvd	this movie certainly had some strong actors and actresses in it and that with an interesting storyline landed it on my viewing list . overall , i was somewhat disappointed with this film . i figured there would be a little more real suspense or `` thrill '' but it never materialized and instead just followed many of the usual plot events . the biggest failure was the completely unneccessary cheesey romance between eastwood and russo . it was contrived , lame , and almost laughable . i had to rub my eyes to make sure i wasnt having a nightmare ! john malkovich does a great job as the wackjob and is totally convincing in this role . unfortunately the script didnt do him enough justice and even his character did some staple moves . clint eastwood was great as always but he did play his usual self . no problem here though , clint was solid . the film just fizzled as it went along and it started to get tiresome towards the very end . the climax was rather anti-climactic except for the shooting scene which was kind of cool although i saw it coming a mile away . there was not as much suspense as i was hoping for and the `` thrill '' was mostly missing . what else can i say , watch it and make your own decision but overall i was not that impressed and the film let me down a bit after such glowing reviews
dvd	`` above the rim '' is an entertaining street drama that focuses around kyle lee watson , an inner-city high school basketball player who shows a lot of promise but lets his own arrogance get the best of him . he wo n't listen to anybody who offers him advice on how to improve his game , as he thinks that he is the best player ever . he 's been hoping that his mad skills are catching a college scout 's attention , but he does catch birdie 's eyes when he plays . birdie is a well known gang leader who offers kyle the good life so long as he plays on his neighborhood team in a `` shoot-out '' basketball contest that means the world to him . kyle -- being impatient as ever -- agrees to join , not seeing the clear danger that is in front of him . a high school security guard with a past knows the danger that birdie presents , and he is the only who has a chance to get through to kyle before it is too late . not only is this a very good basketball movie , but it is also an intense and character-driven drama centered around the choices that we make in life ... and how we have to live with them in the long run . the film has some great performances from duane martin , marlon wayans and the late tupac shakur . even though everybody is great in their roles , the showstopper is indeed shakur . he gives a very masterful performance that really sticks out and will stay with you long after the movie is over . my only complaint is the length of the movie . it 's true that a movie that runs a little over an hour and a half is n't short , but i think the story and the characters open more possibilities to add on to the movie . i think more opportunities and risks could have been taken to further enrich the story . still , it is a really good movie that did n't disappoint me . the dvd does n't have a whole lot to offer . you can either watch the movie in widescreen or in fullscreen , depending on your preference . the movie looks and sounds very good . the only special features that are offered are movie trailers , and those are n't even that great . i would 've loved it if they included the music video , `` regulate '' by warren g and nate dogg . in fact , given some of the great rap songs that are in this movie , they could 've included a couple of music videos . it 's not a great dvd , but at least it 's not that expensive . i really enjoyed `` above the rim . '' it may not be flawless , but it definitely does more right than wrong . the characters are what really dominate the movie . even if you 're not a fan of the game , it 's still something to check out if you 're a fan of character drama . exciting , intense , conflict-driven and full of heart , `` above the rim '' is a very well done film . -michael cran
dvd	jean renoir 's masterpiece , 'the grand illusion ' , is truly a film about humanity - it is a universal theme , something we can all understand and relate to . the triumph of the human spirit in the most troubled times , is kind of an ironic theme considering hitler 's imminent rise to power and the ensuing war that would alter the course of history . nevertheless , jean renoir 's poetic homage to brotherhood is one of his most beloved films . it is not hard to like this movie the acting and direction are superb - jean gabin is one of the all time great actors.. jean renoir 's innovative approach would influence countless directors to come , including orson welles.. criterion did a marvelous job on this dvd - also worth getting is 'the rules of the game ' jean renoir 's greatest satire
dvd	this dvd gives a very good 60 minute workout . as others have pointed out the cardio is very dancy . the first time i did it , i felt a bit awkward with the steps , but when i did it the second time i was able to follow along with no problems . the dance moves are a fun change up from my usual routine . if someone like denise austin were leading this one , i do n't think i would play along . minna is by far my favorite instructor , so i go along with it and it ends up being a fun workout . i would n't want to do this every day , but it is good to have something different in the rotation . i think the toning section is excellent . i am not looking to bulk up . i just want my body to firm up and look better when i wear shorts and a tank top . i like how she combines upper and lower body exercises . it 's easy to follow and you feel like you hit every muscle area in 30 minutes . i use 3 pound weights at this point and i can see where in the future i might be buying 4 pound weights . minna is a great instructor . she has excellent cueing and is very encouraging . she is never annoying . i also have her optimizer- balanced blend dvd and i love that one .
dvd	a broad range of jewish-related-topic movies varies from `` trembling before the g ... d '' to `` the holy land '' , where jewish humor , emphasis on the holocaust and musical inclusions are predominantly accustomed features of . of course , modern israeli cinematograph concentrates more on day-by-day israeli reality , incorporating h o h m e s ( sarcastic jokes ) if necessary . something more linking to a secular modern american reality supposedly depicted in this film does not impress me at all because of a surrealistic mixture of sex-bent traditionally-characteristic inter-religious-confession-gesheft ( profit ) pieces of gay-lesbian-adultery-quickie-drug-secular-hasidic traces of affairs , which is too much for one hour plus story of enjoying their seder continuingly . sorry , it is definitely not my cap of tea . if even this play is r-rated .
dvd	when i 1st watched requiem from the darkness i had high hopes for an anime show i heard that could actually by scary . to my dissappointment this show was not scary at all but a mockery of anything that is anime . this show has good animation is some spots with some deformed shapes of people . the strengths of the show however primarily rely on its soundtrack which is above average but nothing amazing . also the last straw with this show was the horrible depictions of people being graphically murdered . this show is disgusting because of these potrayals a brothers murdering each/husband killing wife after wife/a man who enjoys murder/and very very intense sexual situations of insects and once again family members murdering each other . i recommend this show to no one and i believe geneon has made a mistake licensing it . if you do n't heed my review then you have wasted your money on a dvd not worth a penny ( i would n't take it for free )
dvd	that i bought this movie orginally to see david boreanaz naked . i am very glad that i did . it is a very funny comedy that was a bonus of david 's nice tush in the movie . if you have ever been a baby sitter in your life , you will get a hoot out of this one
dvd	yeah . it 's true . this movie is awesome . i think i watched it four times in the first week i had it
dvd	this movie is so bad . it is just about a annoying valley girl blonde who is rich and has tons of friends and who has no real problems . the only people who like this movie are the ones who wished they were the main character , a pea brained airheaded ditz who has no redeeming qualities . the movie tries hard to invent new `` teen speak '' with tons of lame catch phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who liked the movie so much , they tried to sound like the shallow empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the movie 's fans live the life nowhere close to cher 's and look nothing like her but they want to pretend . the movie hits you with these lame catch phrases every 15 seconds , desprate to beat you over the head with them . in the movie , the main character , cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to her . nasty ! she is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship should be jerry springer . she 's supposed to be a posh valley girl but at the end , she 's like ella may clampet going after jethro when all her resources for finding a man runs out .
dvd	sorry , after reading some negative reviews i just had to speak up . this movie was one of the best movies i have ever seen . i still to this day watch it over and over again . well directed , some of the best acting i have seen , and my god the cast in this movie , the list of stars is endless . the courtroom scenes were so intense , i envey anyone who has not seen this yet . the story was perfect and so many surprises and turns . really well done . this movie is worth every penny , i just wish i would of got to see it in the movies . it is the most powerful movie i have ever seen , how can anyone say this movie was not good , i guess they just ca n't handle the truth..
dvd	stay away from all the movies from wesley snipes ' and steven seagal 's . they are brain-dead movies with brain-dead screenplays , bad directors , bad everythings . this movie , like other viewers ' said , drove me nuts . i have to wear straight jacket to refrain myself everytime when i watched these two guys ' movies , otherwise i might have crashed my tv set or trashed everything around me in order to vant my frustration . amazon.com should also stay away from selling this crappy movie . god help us .
dvd	eraserhead is filled with strange , uncanny scenes . what is it to be uncanny ? dictionary.com defines it as having or seeming to have a supernatural or inexplicable basis ; beyond the ordinary or normal ; mysterious ; arousing superstitious fear or dread ; uncomfortably strange . i would want to define it for this film as the quality of being familiar and strange at the same time . one has the sense of having never seen such weirdness and having vaguely remembered seeing it somewhere . the movie does not have a linear , logical storyline . it is a mood piece , for want of a better term . a visual poem , which depends on what the viewer brings to the interpretation as much as what appears on the screen . if you let your mind play among these images , it will begin to invent meaning for itself . you may be surprised and enlightened at what meanings you find in it . the cinematography is stunning , not beautiful in any traditional meaning of that term , but arresting : you simply can not turn your head away . will you like it ? well , i think this is one of those movies you either love or hate . think of it as a rorshach -- how interesting you find it may just depend on how interesting you are
dvd	i did n't enjoy the film . i also did n't enjoy the original play by shakespeare . king lear is one of my least favorite shakespeare plays . i do n't consider it particularly creative to remake a play that has already been done , and to add nothing of value to the original . you can set it wherever you like , in medieval japan or on the moon , what 's the difference . it 's king lear , a downer of a play , there 's nothing great about ran just as there 's nothing great about lear , and it takes up three hours of your time . a moron named lear , or hidetoro , or whatever his name is , relinquishes power in his kingdom and turns the power over to his oldest son . the youngest son warns him that it is a bad idea because the sons will be disloyal to their father . he is right , of course , and hidetoro lear gets treated shabbily . he 's wanted dead or dead . in this treatment of the annoying plot , he loses his mind . he has a faithful follower or two . they overact . there is nobody to root for in this depressing and ridiculously overrated downer of a play . lear hidetoro is an absolute jerk . am i supposed to care what happens to him ? why ? because he used to be a powerful king , and a cruel one ? you may as well cry over saddam hussein . look at this movie with fresh eyes . look at shakespeare 's king lear with fresh eyes . this stuff simply is not very entertaining , and is not very good . the hell with king lear . he 's an annoyance
dvd	while not one of his best novels , tommyknockers was much better than this waste of time ! jimmy smits does his best , but the underwritten screenplay does him and this movie about dead aliens and the thought control they have over a small new england town is just not worth the trouble ! ! skip it ! ! ! !
dvd	the book offers what feels to be a valuable revelation about improving your game . the information is well presented and the cd is a nice addition ... but really i think counting the the tempo/timing to yourself would be more effective ; at least that worked better for me
dvd	this movie is by far one of the greatest movies ever made . you will laugh all the way thru it..and enjoy when things were so much simplier in hollywood
dvd	if you ca n't get enough of zombie comedies this year , i seriously recommend this one , made in the czech republic of all places ! i saw it at the tribeca film festival ( ny ) and it was tremendous fun . bloody , funny , and smart . an intellectual twist on the `` secluded retreat '' idea - a group gathers at a hotel to do a weekend course about the meaning of their lives . and of course , they 're overrun by zombies . i especially love the way the film weaves between existential exploration and hilarious gore-fest . it works on so many different levels - while your first reaction to it may be mostly visceral , your attention will soon shift to the clever jokes , the interesting characters , and the joyful way it plays with film conventions . this is a rare and unusual film to come out of the czech republic . i was disappointed that it did n't get a theatrical release in the us , so i 'm really glad that it 's coming out on dvd . humor/horror fans will not be disappointed !
dvd	i find it almost incomprehensible in this more enlightened technological age that there are a very limited amount of your subscribers who are concerned about the appaling presentation of all but two of these movies and i also wonder as more and more older movies are being re-released enhanced for widescreen tvs that no one seems concerned that arguably the most classic of classical movie musicals remain in a truncated format that can not be properly watched if one has a widescreen tv . these movies scream out for the widescreen , they were made with the ultimate technology of the time to be seen as wide and as broard as possible . yet they remain stuck in a non anamorphic style that limits their enjoyment to anyone with a widescreen tv and , with one exception , all the people who have written about them dont seem to care . `` oklahoma '' , `` carousel '' , `` south pacific '' and `` king and i '' need to be updated to 16.9 anamorphic widescreen ( also preferably with some genuine extras and commentaries as well ) . fox are years behind the rest of the movie studios in this regard and have only recently started to adapt their films for the format of the future ( ie observe the two versions of `` an affair to remember '' ) of course , this is a major rip off , so anyone with a widescreen tv who has not bought these films -- hold off , coz sooner or later they will get a proper release ... how long ? that is anybody 's guess , but these postage stamp versions are an insult to anyone who knows anything of widscreen dvd technology ( `` sound of music '' is fine and `` state fair '' was made in non widescreen full screen format , an should be viewed with lines either side of the screen
dvd	the folks at pbs deserve the gratitude of photography teachers and students everywhere . taking on subject matter as impossibly broad as photography in 20th century america ? this documentary covers -- sometimes comprehensively , sometimes briefly -- virtually every important topic germane to the field of study , from pictorialism to straight photography , from fashion to the scientific . along the way , we are introduced ( or reintroduced ) to what has been the medium 's most important uses : journalism and documentary . `` a century of images '' is as instructive for the novice as it may be reaffirming to those already familiar with much of the material . underlying a wealth of historical examples and anecdotes are the two twin themes that raise this effort above the mundane : concern over the ethical issues photographs present , and the effects of mechanically produced images in the post-industrial age on the psyche of our nation . these themes manifest themselves in ways that are often revelatory and moving . one memorable example : the way edward curtis 's images of native americans are placed into context by a woman who appreciates them , yet yearns for more images that show her people the way they `` really were . '' sections on war photography cover wwi , wwii , vietnam and the gulf war with compassion , and work as excellent visual aids to discussions on todays situation in iraq . another bonus : the section on the transition to a digital age has not yet outlived its usefulness . until i was able to buy this fabulous history on dvd , my biggest complaint was that while using the vhs version , i had all kinds of problems locating the various scenes i wanted to pull out to show my photography and visual communication courses at the university where i teach . now that i can happily locate scenes at will using the dvd menu , i can direct my ire at its few but significant omissions and shortcomings . more on walker evans , robert frank , diane arbus please . . . . they were pretty damned influential .
dvd	you might think from the title and the commercials this movie is about a super sexy porn star slut ... but it 's actually the opposite . i really liked how the movie was done to portray the struggles some girls really have to go through in their carrers and mixed it with the toughness of high school . this is definately a movie i would reccomend to people over like 16 but only if you want to watch a funny movie about the discovering and strength of two people ... this movie is the real thing , i enjoyed it and i think many other people could too
dvd	this movie is perfect for people in their 40ies and/or 50ies . it just hits the bullseye . lean back and enjoy the ride
dvd	this movie is so dumb that it 's as good with the sound off as with the sound on . the only reason to watch it is to observe the extreme beauty of both leads . a plot as old as the written word could still form the basis of an ok movie with a good script , but this script has no charm , no wit , no nothing
dvd	sound of music 40th anniversary edition ( fox ) is the latest digital version of this beloved , timeless , film . the two-disc set features an exceptionally sharp transfer and a rich audio mix but the real treat is the new commentary with julie andrews and christopher plummer ( this in addition to the late robert wise 's commentary ) . among the wealth of new treasures in the six hours of extras is on location footage , screen tests ( mia farrow sings ) and a wonderful retrospective documentary `` my favorite things : julie andrews remembers . '' sound of music is perfect in all departments . it 's also that rare musical in which the music itself is naturally integral to the story and a counterpoint to the nazi threat of the true-life plot . until hi-def dvds arrive , this is the definitive edition for the library . rated : g. genre : musical . 2 hours , 56 minutes . starring : julie andrews , christopher plummer . director : robert wise
dvd	we all know the movie and story of the silence of the lambs . i reviewed the movie and gave it a 5 star rating because to me , it is one of the best films ever made . now , with red dragon , i give it 4 stars but i think this is a very good movie and what makes it so good is ... . anthony hopkins , the brilliant actor who plays hannibal lecter . i do n't think this movie would have been as good if hopkins would n't have played the role of lecter . i own the original manhunter , which is an older movie and it was good but hopkins can not be beat for the hannibal lecter role . this is a great thriller film ! ! edward norton delivers a very good performance as retired fbi agent will graham . when a series of serial killing style murders start , graham is called out of retirement to help the fbi catch the killer known as `` the tooth fairy '' . he eventually seeks the aid of lecter to help him find who this killer is . like silence of the lambs , we find graham visiting lecter in his maximum security facility . very cool scenes in this movie with some blood and violence . this movie holds true to the book with the same name . we get to see lecter wearing the famous face mask he wore in s.o.t.l . without going further into all the details of the movie , i 'll just say this is a great prequel although it came after s.o.t.l . and the movie hannibal . also , ralph fiennes delivers a good performance as the red dragon . for anyone who has n't seen this movie , it 's a must see ! ! ! !
dvd	this is my favorite toning workout and i 'm sure to incorporate it into my routine for my once a week tone-fest . what i like best about it is that i can customize it to whatever body part i think needs the most work this week . need a 30 minute ab workout ? you can choose it . think the arms and legs need work ? no problem . want to tone a little bit of everything ? you can do that , too . the instructors are all good - clear , not irritating , and they come up with some unique exercises to work each body part - it 's not your standard crunches for ab work on this video . this was one of my best purchases , workout-wise . i wish there were more dvd's/workouts out there with minna lessig - she is my favorite instructor ( she does the arm/leg workouts on this dvd ) . the other two instructors are wonderful as well - and the workout just seems to fly by , although at the end you do know you 've worked those muscle groups .
dvd	this amicus horror anthology film has got to be the weakest in the series , the storylines were terrible and very dull and most of the time it looked like it was very outdated not to mention that the last episode about a washed up actor who turns into a vampire was not funny . usually these amicus films are fun to watch and not scary but good however this film just dragged along , the episode with christopher lee in it was the best one and the only one that was worth watching and ingrid pitt as a sexy vampire thats it , what a waste
dvd	obviously , the music featured here is of high-quality . hardly sign of the times transcendent , but nonetheless very exciting ( as was typical of prince 's 2002 tour ) . unfortunately the director does his/her upmost to ruin everything for you with sub-bootleg grainy picture quality and warped sound , hamfisted camera angle switches , bizarre washed-out colors , some horribly cheesy effects and cuts . for a band featuring nothing but incredibly dextrous musicians who play with an enormous level of detail and complexity , it 's a shame the director clearly has n't the faintest idea how to shoot a concert let alone one featuring musicians of this caliber . hey prince , just so you know ... .your diy `` npgmc '' approach is only impressive if with it you can match what you 'd been able to do had you still had the financial might of a major behind you . if it looks this amateurish then you just look , well ... amateurish . and your talents are not worthy of anything even close to amateur-level presentation . the bootleggers you despise so much put far greater care into the stuff they put out than you obviously could be bothered to do with this . i mean really , you re-shot sign of the times in its entirety at paisley park after the rotterdam/antwerp footage was not up to par : i find it hard to believe that original footage was any worse than this . hardcore prince fans such as myself will want it despite this , but casual fans ( especially those not familiar with the more obscure prince material that makes up most of this concert ) should definitely avoid .
dvd	why ? why waste your time and money on producing crap ? sony execs must be out of their minds . the ghostbuster fans have been waiting years , and writing countless petitions to get the episodes on dvd , and this is what they come up with ? no . give us season dvds . give us a 140 episode box set . give us something . not 4 non-sequential episodes on a disc that can hold many times that . what a waste . this product gets 1 star because , apparently , you ca n't give it zero
dvd	i have several kathy smith videos this is the absolute worse ! i agree with some of the other reviewers that kathy has not rhythm and in this video the steps do not match the beat of the music which makes it frustrating and makes her look very uncoordinated . also , it seems like there a too many people in such a small space , the whole set looks very chaotic . i wonder if kathy thought up the choreography for this one herself , it is very poor . all those crazy shuffle moves ! any other kathy smith workout will be better for you than this one .
dvd	there are certainly some memorable scenes in this film , but as a whole it just did n't quite work for me . vlastimil brodsky is indeed a talented and endearing actor but spends the whole film playing the same stock character : fanda , a maddening yet adorable grandpa , oh-so-young-at-heart , oh-so-mischievious and impish , but somehow oh-so-good-hearted and harmless that you ca n't help loving him warts and all . in fact , that 's one of the fatal flaws of this movie : the lack of any dark side to any of the characters . they 're all basically harmless walt disney types , even the bumbling and self-absorbed son . there are no real consequences to brodsky 's actions other than stella ( his wife ) finally talking divorce but it 's obvious almost as soon as the words are out of her mouth that she 'll come back to him . there is no center , no force or dynamic power in this film -- -it 's like a limp wine that you tolerate because you do n't want to hurt the feelings of your host . the ending also relies on another lazy device , the virtual deux ex machina in the person of stella suddenly transforming into a spirited accomplice/supporter of fanda 's when she sees that his attempt at self-reform is only making him miserable . this film might 've been much more effective and poignant had it spent more time dealing with fanda 's desperate fear and avoidance of dealing with old age and death , instead of focusing on how clever , audacious and adorable of an elderly madcap he is , which makes much of the film reek not only of kitsch but even worse , narcissism . one wonders if the director was just so awestruck at the chance to work with mr. brodsky , who is a towering figure among czech actors , that he decided to turn the film into a bit of a hagiography of him . a more accurate title for this movie , especially given the ludicrous ending shot as the credits roll , might be : `` the fantasy life of a poor old man . ''
dvd	not a good copy of this great movie . i 'd wait and buy the `` restored authorized edition . '' even though i bought this version , i 've ordered the other . that 's how much i like metropolis is general
dvd	since `` er '' debuted on nbc in 1994 , it 's taken the nation by storm . it 's wonderfully produced by author michael chricton , a former surgeon before his writing career . for numerous years , it was the # 1 drama series on television . the show starts with the cast of anthony edwards ( mark greene ) , george clooney ( doug ross ) , sherry stringfield ( susan lewis ) , noah wyle ( john carter ) , julianna margulies ( carol hathaway ) , and eriq la salle ( peter benton ) . it has since won and been nominated for several awards including emmys . its hospital action combined with personal drama always draws audiences deeply into every scene for every episode . its emergency scenes grown in intensity and drama through the episodes . season one introduces the everyday life in the er in chicago . throughout , it explores many critical issues including hathaway 's self-destruction that results in a suicide attempt , carter struggling as a medical student , ross living his sex obsessed life , and others . regular show viewers who have n't seen season one will see part of lewis 's reason for leaving chicago in 1996 , greene in his first marriage and before ella 's birth ( mother is corday , who began in 1997 ) , deb chin 's ( played by ming na ) brief time in that er as a medical student before returning as an official doctor in 2000 , and many others . such combination shows partially how the show 's theme evolved to today . episode by episode , the plot 's quality stays on top . the overall scenery , through the physical environment to the emotional drama , never fails to compile the unforgettable viewing experience . season two features the debuts of gloria reuben ( jeanie boulet ) and laura innes ( kerry weaver , not an official cast member until season 3 ) . this season explores ross 's most heroic act as a doctor , carter becoming a doctor , lewis being forced to care for her neice , and many more . today 's viewers who have n't seen season two will witness boulet before testing positive for hiv , weaver before realizing her lesbianism , hathaway before her today 's happy life ( though now in seattle ) , and others . this plot evolves very well in quality from the previous season . it continues its run of staying on top in critical care and drama . both seasons feature wonderful acting from the entire cast . all add their own sense of individual theme into every scene . through personal struggles , drama , and continually saving lives , everyone gives the show its unique viewing flavor . such show quality makes `` er - the complete first two seasons '' worthy for all fans . this is sure to please its audiences . new viewers should watch these two seasons first . otherwise , the plot will be confusing . fans should watch for season 3 to be released on video in the near future
dvd	i bought this because raquel welch was in it . she did a good job but it 's not worth it . i loss interest as sonn as i heard the guy talking about the people in the movie . this dvd was dated back to the 1920s and how a movie star struggles to get his life back
dvd	while it is certainly fun to watch just to see the performers , this history of rock simply does n't jell as a whole.by trying to explain the evolution of the music , the pleasure gets lost along the way.if you are a rock connaisseur , you wo n't learn many new things if you watch this.what you should do is take it as a starter point and then go further with documents who gets deeper with one particular field ( ex : motown or british invasion ) .as it is , it tries to cover too much ground at once and still manages to forget a few artists like emerson , lake and palmer and king crimson among others.it costs me $ 80 dollars ( canadian money ) for this 5 dvd set , which is too much for what it 's worth.rent it and enjoy the clips
dvd	believe the good reviews written here about this film . i havent cared much thus far for the movies penn has directed after this one , i suppose its because i feel this is such a great film , he created a tough act to follow , but even if he never does top it , he can rest easy knowing he has made a great film that will stand the test of time . i like long moody films that you can settle down into a couch and get absorbed into , and this is one of those . although , i would say it could have been trimmed down just a bit , as the pace gets just a little too slow in some areas . but overall this is a great movie , with great performances by all , and it packs an after-punch in that you may not really feel how much it has moved you until its over . im not easily touched by most movies , but this film had tears building up in my eyes ready to roll with the ending credits . its without a doubt one of my favorite films . this is the kind of film that reminds you , movies at there best can indeed be considered a work of art
dvd	just show the real machines working , forget all the goofy narration that is annoying to adults and does n't even hold my son 's interest . he much prefers the fred levine series or the i love cat machines series
dvd	i love this film , beautifully simple and human . the characters are real ; flawed yet somehow you find sympathy for them- just like your own family . i 've rented at least fifteen times , and i never get bored of it . it 's great any time of year , but fantastic for the holidays
dvd	i do n't know what the last poster was thinking ... this dvd goes to the top of my worst quality list . i would n't complain as much but they are advertized as `` digitally remastered , '' which is obviously meaningless . `` long john silver '' is soft-focus , borderline blurry , throughout ; marred with constant flecks and blobs ; and has countless vertical scratches that score the full image . it 's like watching some old home movie you found in a trunk . have n't viewed `` captain kidd , '' but a cursory scan indicated it too is in poor condition . if that 's the best the films come , and there 's no money for clean-up , so be it . but get that misleading `` digitally remastered '' off the box . that 's a hoodwink if ever there was one
dvd	like many of the reviewers here , i am an anne rice fan . however , i knew that there were going to be liberties taken and was comfortable with them . i mean , few of the `` dracula '' movies throughout the years have had anything to do with bram stoker 's novel . all i wanted - and expected - was a flashy , no substance guilty pleasure movie , a la `` dracula 2000 . '' that alone should tell you my expectations . but qotd failed even as a guilty pleasure . the storyline did n't make a lot of sense when taken on it 's own , and the acting was bad to bland . i also take issue with the badly-done look of the vampires . rice 's vampires are supposed to be beautiful , whereas this bunch looked like eurotrash or people at a halloween spook house . however , one good thing about this movie is the music videos for lestat . since the videos are included on the dvd , it earns 1 star
dvd	i like almost all of lifetime 's movies and love tuning in to watch but this was certainly not one of the best . the name bring `` obsessed '' was not what it should have been called , the lady was dreaming and had an illness . this movie had a horrible twist which made the ending bad and hard to follow and understand the whole way through , this movie was not what i had expected . as i said i like almost all of lifetime original movies but i definitely wa n't be watching this one again .
dvd	i was greatly disappointed in this dvd . here 's why : 1 . it 's basically 60 minutes of warming up 2 . the level 3 ( advanced ) is not that hard . 3 . the annoying `` inhale , exhale '' chant really makes it difficult to find my 'center . ' i just wanted to tell her shut up 4 . i did n't break a sweat once . 5 . i used it twice and never plan to use it again . i mean , c'mon , i do n't want to waste 1 hour of my day on something that wo n't get me results . i must say the only thing positive about this dvd is the landscape . in short , rent this from blockbuster or buy it used . do n't waste any more than 5 bucks on this . it 's not worth it .
dvd	with a good script and a director better suited to the material ( i 've read pedro almodovar expressed interest in adapting the novel and jonathan demme was originally attached to direct ) , asylum could have been a superb exploration of romantic obsession and a great showcase for star natasha richardson . unfortunately , the film poorly tries to condense too much plot and things happen so fast that the film fails to fully explore the psychology of its characters in cinematic terms ... a pretty major flaw for a movie that is supposed to be an exploration of the psychological effects of sexual obsession . the basic plot concerns the affair between the bored psychiatrist 's wife ( an excellent natasha richardson ) and one of the asylum 's patients ( an equally good marton csokas ) , under the watchful eye of the patient 's doctor ( ian mckellen ) . there are several plot twists in the last part of the movie , some of which seem quite preposterous , at least in the way the movie was shot . the only reason to watch this movie is to see natasha richardson . she does her best in spite of the choppy script , and she even won a best actress award in london for this film . however , as a psychological thriller or an exploration of sexual repression and obsession , director david mackenzie has done an extremely sloppy job . ( in fact , i remember that in the promotional interviews richardson , credited as an executive producer , sounded very disappointed about the way the movie turned out .
dvd	with the phenomenal success of `` the poseidon adventure '' , the first disaster movie of its kind , the sequel was sure to be a hit . not so . a plot containing two rival treasure salvagers combined with survivors still on board sounded great . having a leading lady ( sally fields ) fresh from an oscar win and a few veteran actors ( michael caine , karl malden ) , might also sound promising . unfortunately , the magic of the set production of the original is not even close . instead of upside ballrooms , barber shops , kitchens and bathrooms , the audience is presented with storage rooms simply full of boxes . the rest of the cast is comprised of television actors , who are as wooden as the script . there 's no tension and some of the lines are so incredibly ridiculous , you wo n't even laugh in disbelief . irwin allen had gold slip right through his fingers with this very promising sequel . considering the original , that 's a terrible shame
dvd	as socrates once said `` i drank what ? '' frank bigelow ( edmond o'brien , you may remember him as winston smith in `1984 ' 1956 ) realizes after he had a one night fling that he does not feel so good . he feels bad enough to see a doctor . yep he is d.o.a . ( dead on arrival ) as he has been poisoned and only has a little time left to live . obsessed with finding out who did it and why , frank has to reconstruct his wild night . will he find out in time ? if so what then ?
dvd	this movie was very hard to find . found it in dvd an it was new
dvd	this one is just plain awful ! ! it 's a bunch of hollywood brats being histrionic .
dvd	this is great holloween movie to watch to get you in the spirit ! i watch it numerous times every year right before holloween with my little sister . its a great movie ! ! ! ! ! ! !
dvd	the story here dose n't matter . the main characters fuse into a missle of meth and insanity towards an explosive ending . scwartzman escapes his fate temporarily and murphy is blessed with a reprieve but rourke pays the full price for his evil concoction , meth . quirky directing and film editing can be somewhat distracting but not meaningless . roberts is so gay you want to smack his face . he an rourke have history on film and play out their familiarity . rourke is phenomonal again as an immoral genius , a role he plays better than anyone today in film . br
dvd	this set is fine as far as it goes . however , where are the strawberry blonde and the oklahoma kid ? warners has given other actors 6 or 7 disc sets . why not cagney ? on the other hand , maybe a cagney , volume 2 is in the works . let 's hope so
dvd	ok , first of all oct fri the 13th i finally saw this movie in 3d , sigh i can die happy ! ok this one is really pretty awesome . chris plays a great leading girl ( the only f-13 leadi didnt want to see with an axe in her skull ) . the other characters are pretty harmless too . wev'e got bikers ( snort ) , pothead hippies , a fro 'd chubster and a dude who can walks on his hands better than he can act . plus this came out in the early 80 's so the ratings board didnt demolish all the awesome gore scenes . i give this one a high-5 ! cool deaths , funny scenes and aside from chris 's sherbert pants , some decent 80 's fashion too . yo debbie , i want your bikini , too cuuute .
dvd	season four is excellent , ca n't wait for the release of season five
dvd	moving , intelligent , realistic , not overly acted ( as could quite easily have been the case ) . about a 20 year old who has gone off the rails to come back onto them again ... you see why this has happened , feel sympathy , and just want him to do well when the film ends . a story about hope , in a world with little..
dvd	as the reviews below indicate , `` arthur '' has a lot of fans -- when it was released in 1981 vincent canby of the new york times found it a wonderful `` screwball comedy '' ( although over time , times readers , perhaps more discerning than vincent , have only rated it 3 out of 5 stars ) and bravo listed it # 10 on its list of best comedies ( see below ) . i first saw dudley moore in `` foul play , '' thought he was very funny . based upon that , i bought `` 10 '' and `` arthur , '' as it turned out a downward trajectory . what i dislike about `` arthur '' is moore playing a loud , obnoxious drunk telling unfunny jokes , and minelli playing a salt-of-the-earth working girl who loves arthur for himself , not for his $ 750 million fortune . even john gielgud , who was great in `` the loved one '' a much better comedy , ca n't resurrect this turkey . okay , folks . start casting your negative votes . in the meantime , here 's the bravo 100 best comedies list : 100 . anchorman 99 . the birdcage 98 . school of rock 97 . happy gilmore 96 . four weddings and a funeral 95 . harold kumar go to white castle 94 . waiting for guffman 93 . the aristocrats 92 . father of the bride 91 . revenge of the nerds 90 . clueless 89 . slapshot 88 . team america 87 . the kentucky fried movie 86 . zoolander 85 . dirty rotten scoundrels 84 . silver streak 83 . sister act 82 . tootsie 81 . half baked 80 . lost in america 79 . three amigos 78 . bananas 77 . flirting with disaster 76 . ghostbusters 75 . dumb and dumber 74 . trading places 73 . city slickers 72 . moonstruck 71 . roxanne 70 . the nutty professor ( eddie murphy ) 69 . the blues brothers 68 . broadcast news 67 . kingpin 66 . dazed and confused 65 . office space 64 . this is spinal tap 63 . manhattan 62 . the pink panther 61 . election 60 . when harry met sally 59 . police academy series 58 . private benjamin 57 . swingers 56 . young frankenstein 55 . bull durham 54 . ferris bueller 's day off 53 . dr. strangelove 52 . meet the parents 51 . national lampoon 's vacation 50 . the princess bride 49 . american pie 48 . american graffiti 47 . 9 to 5 46 . the incredibles 45 . raising arizona 44 . sixteen candles 43 . what about bob ? 42 . harold and maude 41 . austin powers 40 . monty python and the holy grail 39 . mrs. doubtfire 38 . best in show 37 . dodgeball 36 . good morning vietnam 35 . beetlejuice 34 . rushmore 33 . clerks 32 . groundhog day 31 . the big lebowski 30 . the 40 year old virgin 29 . legally blonde 28 . annie hall 27 . a fish called wanda 26 . wayne 's world 25 . meet the fockers 24 . bill ted 's excellent adventure 23 . big 22 . beverly hills cop 21 . shampoo 20 . the jerk 19 . wedding crashers 18 . stripes 17 . m*a*s*h 16 . old school 15 . fast times at ridgemont high 14 . napoleon dynamite 13 . naked gun series 12 . the producers 11 . pee-wee 's big adventure 10 . arthur 9 . ace ventura : pet detective 8 . blazing saddles 7 . the wedding singer 6 . airplane 5 . south park : bigger , longer , uncut 4 . there 's something about mary 3 . shrek 2 . caddyshack 1 . animal house my suggested additions : `` the loved one , '' `` leap of faith , '' `` used cars , '' `` eulogy '' and `` drop dead , gorgeous .

dvd	they spend the first half of this movie saying how great the ultimate warrior was . the journey is awesome ! then all of the sudden , the paid wwe guys just began to bad-mouth the warrior . maybe he did have questionable judgment - but why are they trying to make us feel bad about someone we loved ? they take some very low blows . they say that the warrior was a bad wrestler . actually he seemed just fine to me when i was young , and i really ca n't distinguish one 's ability from the other . they just all gang up on him and make outragious allegations . vince says quickly that the reason why the ultimate disappeared for 3 years was because he failed a drug test . as soon as he says this , they fade to black then come back with a new issue . what drug use ? which drugs ? presumably they 're talking about steroids . but what about that high and mighty hulk hogan with his admitted drug use . let 's not talk about that - let 's just keep ganging up on the warrior . they completely ridicule him changing his name to the warrior . and they also just try to badmouth him so much . who cares that none of the wrestlers liked him ? i do n't ! he excited the heck out of me way more than any of the dorks who say bad things about him -including hulk . and oh yeah - they do n't even let the warrior defend himself . why did i have to find out from imdb.com that he was asked to appear but declined ? why do n't they address this ? this `` docu '' is more slanted than `` fahrenheitt 911 '' every wrestling and ultimate warrior fan will start out loving this docu then hating it . it just leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth , tired of all of the whining and bitter trash talking .
dvd	terrible direction , terrible writing , it almost feels like the director did n't know what he was working with . although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality of the movie clue , it fails to realize that the plot and characters are incredibly riculous and not funny ha ha but funny stupid . it was a total watse of good celluloid
dvd	this is possibly one of the worst films i have ever seen . the writing and acting , as far as i am concerned , are no better than that of a middle school live performance . the only reason i did n't turn it off was that i was hoping something in the movie might help me justify spending $ 10 to buy it used . that something never came . i would never waste my time on this movie when there are others on this topic that so richly deserve my viewing time investment , such as `` schindler 's list '' & amp ; `` the pianist '' . trust me , pass it up just as fast as you can
dvd	this film i have to say is beautiful looking , from the characters to the landscape . although lacking in numerous and long fight scenes , it does keep things interesting with matrix like effects . the only problem is the love between the two main characters . the movie never lets you feel the love between them , and the girl seems always distant about the love anyway i mean it is called heart under blade right ? the main ninja character has the coolest power and he always seems troubled to use them it . this film is more of a drama sprinkled with ninja action and beautiful visuals !
dvd	i just ca n't say enough good things about the brainy baby series of videos and toys . i have allowed my baby to watch one brainy baby video per day since he was about 6 months old . he loves them . and i love being able to have a few minutes to clean my kitchen . : ) as soon as the brainy baby theme music comes on he starts to smile . he is captivated . i like them much more than the baby einstein videos . and the toys ... ... .he loves them . `` hello , brainy baby ! '' they are the most loved and most used toys in his toy box . i have to keep an extra stash of batteries just to make sure that they are all working all the time . we love brainy baby at our house .
dvd	very short game , took about 2 hours to finish it ( took a lot longer than that for the junk steam system to activate it , because as always their `` system is unavailable , please try again later '' - took around six hours and 10 attempts before it was playable , and definately it will be the last steaming product i buy ) . as to the game , you get 3 weapons and pretty much one set of scenary . gameplay was average for a shooter . it seems `` episodes '' basically translates to `` really short game , which just randomly ends leaving you wondering if you missed something '' .
dvd	first of all , yes , this film was made in vancouver , with only a few shots of the manhattan skyline . when golden harvest was making this film , they had to try their best to shoot at angles that did n't show any mountains , and they had to paint grafitti each day and unpaint it each night . then jackie chan told them to simply forget all of that and focus on the action . well , action was what they focused on the most indeed . it sure is funny to see how the chinese thought of the united states at this time , because what you see in this film are hippies that drive around in trucks full of beach balls . you also get multi-ethnic gangs trashing places ( seriously , the gang has a native american with pigtails and a frayed jacket ! that 's almost offensive ) . you have fat cops that just sit around smoking cigars . you have random , small-crowd rock concerts where everyone is dressed up in animal suits ! bizarre indeed . as for the actions , this film has some of his best . the first fight scene in the grocery store is supurb , and graceful , using his jacket to dispatch enemies , and endlessly hitting the same guy in the nose over and over . he takes on the entire gang in a back alley before getting cornered , very impressive . this leads to a scene where he 's being chased around the streets of new york , where the entire gang , on motor cycles , try to run him over , and jackie must rely on his ability to run like the wind and climb like a monkey . he also does a dangerous stunt where he jumps from the roof of a parking garage onto a fire escape of another building . no harness or wiresupport ! the fight scene at the gang 's hideout is also one his best , using whatever object he can get his hands ont , and very acrobatic . also , jackie chan has to cling to a hovercraft while it drives on water and land ! some of this was done on a broken ankle ! if this dvd was uncut and undubbed , and had the original score , i 'd give it a total of three stars . unfortunately , for a so-so film , new line makes it worse . some of the dubbing is very bad . it seems as if new line dubbed some of the original english dialouge also . only very , very little of the original cantonese dialouge is there . also , the film 's original score has been redone to a more orchestrated score with slight rock . many , many scenes were cut from the original movie . not only that , but some of the action scenes were cut too . try and find an uncut version out there . this dvd you should stay away from
dvd	i grew up watching sesame street and truly love the muppets . however , i have to say this video was not what i expected . there were some great vintage clips , but not enough muppets/monsters for me . this video seemed hastily thrown together with bad editing . i would recommend you pass on this one and get `` 123 count with me '' instead .
dvd	this is a hilariously written and acted film about two young people who get carried away with the beauty of an old house only to find that it is seriously flawed . tom hanks and shelly long are fantastic and people who love old houses will really identify with this
dvd	i like this video for it 's frankness and straight forward approach of a woman enjoying herself . like yoga , it requires slowing down and noticing how your body feels while your watching it . the energy slowly rises and the woman increases it by playing with the tempo and rhythm of her touches . the quality of her session is unhurried and she is very relaxed and keeps her body still but her finger is moving in synchronicity with her orgasm . i found that in itself very interesting and different . it is refreshing to find a product that is different from the common depiction of women emulating ecstasy but one in which shows a woman actually really feeling what it feels like to create it in her body and show what it looks like . she shows a way of masturbating and stretching the sensation out that can really tweak your reality of how much pleasure a woman is capable of experiencing , a mind bender so to speak , and it challenges the cultural limitations of what orgasm is for a woman and how she experiences it
dvd	what a great cast ! i mean looking at this line up you just have to watch this movie , right ? after it starts it is so mesmerizingly awful that you still have to watch it , although you are shaking your head in disbelief ! stunning ! you 've never seen anything quite like it ! if you are a fan of the campy awful , you may see it as a masterpiece , if not you will still have a unique viewing experience . proceed at your own risk ! borrow or rent it before plunking down your hard earned cash to buy it . did i mention the great cast ? so many of my favorites ... even goodman ca n't save this clunker
dvd	i do n't have a review , i have a question . as a grandparent of a 10 year old blind girl . is it possible that someone could send me directions for this game ? i would like to get it printed in braille for her . thanks for your help..judi ree
dvd	it has been a couple years since i 've seen this , and i can still honestly say that it 's like watching a andy warhol movie of salvor dail puking . a kind of swirly colorful mess , with brendan fraser and bridget fonda stuck in the ooze of ick , and ca n't escape it 's yuck of a screenplay ... on a positive note , jim carrey is n't in it . other then that , nothing can redeem henry selick , kaja blackley , and sam hamm for this putrid monstrosity , and i mean that from the bottm of my heart
dvd	i saw this at a friends house -- so thank god i did n't pay any money to see this bit of idiocy . i can only assume any good review you read was written by someone with a financial stake in the film ! the guys are not hot ... not even lukewarm for that matter . the acting is terrible . please ... anyone who had anything to do with this , do n't continue in the film industry . if it was possible to assign negative stars , i would do so for this awful experience . run away
dvd	attila was a 2001 mini series which won the honor of being the most watched mini-series of its day . it features a stellar cast including powers boothe as a crafty roman leader who tries to use attila to gain possession of rome . gerard butler is attila , the hun , and he is everything about attila in this role , never was an actor better suited . his character is sharp , passionate , determined and has an instant magnatism that keeps the viewer glued to the film . he brings a strong intensity and subtle gentleness to the character which makes watching him clash with boothe even more dynamic . this is a definite watch for anyone that likes period piece drama or just really well staged war scenes
dvd	this movie is such a breath of fresh air . finally there 's a movie that 's profound , amusing , and relatable . it 's nice to watch something that really hits home without begin cheesy or overdone and you can never go wrong with jean louisa kelly or amanda peet
dvd	craig is one of the funniest comics that i have ever seen . he has one the funniest standup routines , that i have ever seen . i guess that is why he was voted comedian of the year
dvd	fellini brings light on space instead of space on light . he brings mysticism to the movie not the movie to mysticism . he brings boredom and rattling to a new height . lots of nice emotionalism and sweat . waging tongues and blood . candles and tits . bondage and perversion . we learn italian words that we can not use . here is a good tidbit `` child of aphrodite and hermes ... hermaphrodite . '' the subtitles conveniently disappear at crucial moments . even in italian the voices do not match the sound . one of the roman dudes encolpio ( martin potter ) finally got a real part as `` doctor who '' in1983 .
dvd	i used to think he was great , till i caught the director 's cut of 'das boot . ' all of a sudden you 're confronted with this ridiculous synthesizer music that was n't in the original , and the spell is broken . let 's not even talk about 'air force one . ' now i 've seen 'the perfect storm ' twice , and i own the book , but i still have n't read it because i 'm reasonably sure the book must suck if the movie is this bad . and i 'm sorry new england , but what are gloucestermen anyways , except for great rapers of the high seas ? what will they not do for a buck , you might ask . ok , they are not as bad as the japanese , but they all stalk the world on floating slaughterhouses like there 's no tomorrow . watching this movie definitely made me take fish off the menu . sure you will find excitement aplenty , amped up to eleven . even experience fleeting moments when you might ponder the plight of seafarers throughout history . i even like some of the principal actors , but in the end all they do is make a pretty bad movie slightly more interesting than it should be . this just does n't stand up to repeat viewings . unless you enjoy feeling like a sucker . do you
dvd	the movie is a brillant mix of drama , love , and comedy . the casting was brillant with greats like judd and bullock . in the movie we are introduced to siddalee walker a women who has made her mother vivianne mad . vivianne always seemed heartless and distant to sidda and when sidda tells a reporter about her mother some things get twisted out of proportion and printed the wrong way , which makes vivi mad . enter the ya-ya 's three of vivi 's friends . they feel that sidda should know the truth about her mother and maybe she would understand . so they kidnap sidda and start to tell her about her mother . we learn that vivi was n't well liked by her own mother and was seen as a bad person by her mother . then we learn that vivi 's first love whom she never got over was killed at war which is why she hates her husband . sidda then starts to question her current realationship thinking she 'll be a bad mother and calls off her wedding . phase two of the ya ya 's plan . they must tell sidda something about her mother that will change everything . very good plot that will make you cry and laugh at the same time . this would be a good one to watch with friends or mothers . penny lan
dvd	i had read -- with delight -- the book called `` mrs. frisby and the rats of nimh '' to my grandsons , so i thought the movie would be a nice followup . wrong ! it barely resembles the book , and all the most important parts are glossed over or left out . it might be ok for a child who has n't read the book , but we were disappointed
dvd	without words ... been waiting my whole life to get this picture ; it can take you from laughing ur heart out to burst into tears ; no comments coz i 'll ruin it but it 's simply a wonderfull movie
dvd	colorado 's san juan mountains from durango to silverton to ouray is my favorite place to vacation in the usa . so when i saw the preview of durango kids on another dvd , i decided to rent it on netflix . it is one of those movies where villains are cartoonish , and the kids , while cute , outsmart all the stupid adults . the first 30 minutes showed some nice locations in and around durango , including the steam train ( that 's why i purchased a used copy ) but then it goes into time travel to save ouray from becoming a ghost town and the movie becomes a stupid bore , intended for young and undemanding children . do n't bother unless you love durango as much as i do
dvd	recent scholarship has determined the chinese invented the lightbulb in 1800 bc , the internal combustion engine in 2200 bc , and established a world wide grid of radio communication satellites in 650 ad . all this without any systematic mathematics . hurrah for the chinese . alas , like the records of the above globe trotting oriental sailor , all the information and data concerning said miracles of intellectual invention have disappeared , somewhere either burnt , or submerged in tar . but speculation continues . meanwhile , spaghetti was invented there , without which no italy would have arisen . oh , and crackers , they invented crackers , and bed posts first
dvd	i had heard so many great things about this movie but it is just not my cup of tea . i do n't know if it because i tend to like more horror type movies or what but i was really bored by them . each of the movies started off really slow and they all ended basically the same way . i know the whole theme is humans are trash but it would have been nice for a little more suspense . the movies were violent but nothing one has n't seen before several times so i am not sure about the shock value of it ... i was n't shocked , disturbed or upset ... ... ... just bored
dvd	joan crawford had it . star quality . when i first saw her in 'grand hotel ' i was surprised how much i was watching her character instead of the equally riveting character played by the great greta garbo . both were stars . but crawford was able to project a different kind of sensuality than garbo - a vulnerability , a plucky girl-next-door quality . in humoresque , an older crawford was still able to achieve this level of performance paired off with the younger male star . let 's face it - women have a great advantage acting ( perhaps women are always acting ) - besides being better looking than men , they can emote more without going out of gender role . a distinct advantage vis-a-vis men who must restrict their emotional range or be accused of over acting . it 's a horrible thing to fall in love . and that is just what crawford 's character does . falls in love with the worst of all possible choices : a musician . musicians only love music . the music in the film is worth the price of admission alone . who amongst you would throw the first stone at a fine violinist playing 'zigeunerwisser ' or any of the other fine war horses of the classical violin repertoire ? she falls in love with the young 'artist of the month ' whom she offers to help jumpstart his career , renting a concert hall for his first recital . she is married to a wealthy but understanding man who loves her but lets her do what she wants - drinking , philandering ... most men do what she wants and accept her ridicule . the character of the musician does not ; he 's a tough new yorker who gives her as good as he gets - and she finds herself loving him despite herself . love is madness , and when he starts being successful with his concert tours but neglects to phone her for weeks , she falls apart emotionally . it is profoundly humiliating to realize someone else can hurt you badly simply by declining to keep in touch . silence is the perfect expression of contempt , is n't it ? she drinks , she mopes about her 'cottage ' in the hamptons , she is crazy in love with a man who does n't seem to reciprocate her feelings . in our time , she might see her doc and get a prescription for zoloft to be rid of the lovesick blues and of obsessive thoughts of him . but this is before thorazine , even , and she 's just out of luck there . so she drinks . drinking was the preferred way to deaden the unbearable pain of rejection in love in the days before designer drugs were available from your neighborhood spice man . to complicate things , her musician had an old girlfriend from the conservatory where he studied music as a young man . additionally , there was the dreaded 'american mom ' in full armor . she just had to tell this grown son of hers , repeatedly , that the woman he finally fell in love with was no good . she even slaps him upside the head as he shows her around his ritzy new apartment with a view ; it seems he has too many portraits of crawford 's character in view . that 's the way , mom . make your boy marry a good girl , like you , maybe . meanwhile , and i just love a line the character played by oscar levant comes up with at her cottage in the hamptons , `` you 're not the kind of woman who lets her husband get in the way of her marriage . '' a lot funnier said than written . levant did a lot of great piano playing in the film , dropping dozens of one liners like that . he almost stole several acts . this is a very forties film . in black and white . whatever happened to the colorization process ? oh , well . finally , mom tells the rich girl to keep her hands off her son . and dutifully , crawford 's character retreats to her cottage in the hamptons , gets drunk one last time , wades into the surf in a stunning , shimmering black cocktail dress and is never seen again . i told you love was dangerous ! her lover , after cancelling one measly concert out of despair at her death , decides not to ruin a promising career and returns to the concert stage . men ! emotional iqs of 30 , at most . well , that 's all folks . if your eyes were still dry at the end of this film , you 're safe - you 'll never fall in love
dvd	season one of nelwlyweds is hilarious ... .you will enjoy watching nick jessica and all the funny moments that took place the first year of their marriage ! the extra footage on the dvd 's gives you even more insight from the `` lovebirds '' themselves ! i recommond `` newlyweds '' to all the nick jessica fans out there
dvd	this is probably the worst war related movie i 've ever seen . i am particularly incensed by several actors who are featured as being in the film are present for as little as a single minute or two . time spent watching this film is time you 'll never get back and have nothing to show for it
dvd	this movie is high in my top 10 off all times list , and is probably the best 'mainstream hollywood ' movie i can think of . i watched it for the 3rd or 4th time and it is just as enjoying , thrilling and suspenseful as it was when i saw it first more than 10 years ago . my 12 years old daughter watched it with me for the first time and enjoyed it just as well . great performance by all cast but especially hanks , paxton and beacon . probably ron howard best film ever
dvd	the story of `` alice in wonderland '' was controversial from the moment that the reverend charles lutwidge dodgson , aka lewis carroll , wrote it . some took the story as horror rather than a childhood fantasy . others consider alice 's journey as a trip into or through insanity . for better or worse , disney did capture many of these elements , and the same criticisms of the books that form the basis of this film apply to the film . however , there are also those who loved the books and loved the film . normally i recommend disney classis without reservations . in the case of this movie , i will keep a couple of provisos . alice is a young girl bored by her lessons . as the length of the lessons grows , alice soon drifts off , until a white rabbit passes by , muttering to himself that he is late . alice follows the white rabbit and falls into a rabbit hole that seems to fall forever . luckily for alice her dress opens out into a kind of parachute and slows her descent . once at the bottom of the hole , alice discovers a door into which she is unable to pass because the door is too small . however , there is a vial labeled `` drink me '' that alice discovers makes her small enough to go through the door . alice is soon on her way into a series of surreal adventures that are in the best tradition of adult animation . indeed , alice might have worked better as an adult story given the number of references to adult vices and frailties throughout the film . even the fundamental basis of alice 's journey through wonderland owes as much to psychological references as it does childhood fantasies . the ending of alice 's journey in particular is quite frightening , especially to younger children , embodying all that can be horrible in nightmares . i remember seeing `` alice in wonderland '' as a child , and i remember i thought the ending was scary , and i was relieved when alice was able to escape back to the normal world . given that this film is well over fifty years old , i was disturbed by the smoking caterpillar , if for no other reason than our current knowledge of what smoking does . the smoke did negatively affect alice as it made her cough . perhaps there is an object lesson for children here . while some consider many of the references to allude to drugs , i think that is a modern interpretation . i think eating or drinking items to get larger or smaller was merely a convenient plot device for the author rather than an allegory for drug use . remember that this story was first published in 1869 . i believe this film is excessively criticized by those who do not like its style and the post-era associations with negative elements that were never intended by the original author and by disney . for all these provisos , this film is excellent . it matches `` fantasia '' in its surreal visions , and the construct and tying together of the individual stories is superb . the animation is marvelous as well , readily illustrating the vision of alice 's journey . this movie is one of those rare disney films that i am unable to recommend to all viewers . whether you will enjoy this film is strictly a matter of personal taste . if you enjoy animation oriented toward adults , then you may find this animation a treat . if you are open-minded about the story and consider when the story was written and animated , you may also find that you enjoy it . i do recommend this movie for slightly older children , perhaps 8 and above , considering some of the disturbing images . good luck !
dvd	back in the 1980s , back before every television show was `` csi : city of your choice '' and `` law order : crime division of your choice , '' there was a veritable plethora of well-written , clever , hour-long mystery programmes - `` magnum p.i. , '' `` murder , she wrote , '' `` moonlighting , '' `` hart to hart , '' `` the a-team , '' to name just a few . and this was when most people still only had three commercial networks to choose from ( not counting pbs ) . but far and away , the best of these mystery shows ( and perhaps the most under-rated ) was `` remington steele , '' in which pierce brosnan ( with second billing ! ) and stephanie zimbalist fought crime with style , dash , wit , comedy , and a bit of romance . the series , with its rat-a-tat dialogue , vaguely deco feel ( a slight deco revival was the only good thing about `80s dï¿½cor ) , and occasional zaniness , at times harkens back to the wonderful preston sturges-esque screwball comedies of the 1930s and `40s . indeed , it 's clear from the moment that brosnan appears on the screen in episode one of season one that not only did he have the star power of classic hollywood , but he was a cary grant for our times ; devastatingly handsome in dapper saville row suits with an accent as charming and distinctive as grant 's . ( as an aside , it 's also clear that brosnan was born to play james bond - truly , who was surprised that he was bestowed with the honor , albeit belatedly ? we wo n't get into the infamous season five vs . bond debacle . ) in the entertainment field , there are actors-with-a-lowercase- '' a '' ( pretty much everyone falls into this category nowadays ) , actors-with-a-capital- '' a '' ( truly impressive sorts , such as judi dench , vanessa redgrave , and anthony hopkins ) , and then there are stars . brosnan is clearly the lattermost , bright and luminous . zimbalist , as sleuth laura holt , is spunky , and makes a valiant attempt to be rosalind russell to brosnan 's grant , but , somehow , she falls slightly flat . nevertheless , there 's no denying the chemistry between the two , which is what really `` makes '' the show . ( this is particularly remarkable considering that the two notoriously did n't get along whilst filming the series . ) references to classic hollywood are constant , and amusing - remington steele , the ( sort of ) reformed con-man-with-a-heart-of-gold has an encyclopedic knowledge of film , and often inadvertently stumbles across the solution to the weekly puzzle by drawing a comparison to a classic film . ( `` joseph cotton , orson wells , `the third man , ' british lion film corporation , 1949 . '' is a particular favorite throughout the run of the series , as are cary grant films and , ironically , the occasional bond reference . ) the show was scored by the wonderful henry mancini , he of `` charade '' ( a grant reference , yet again ! ) , `` the pink panther , '' and `` breakfast at tiffany 's '' fame ( among many others ) , which of course , adds to the caper/romantic feel of the show . ( by the way , i 'll take the somewhat chaste clinches of remington and laura over the sordidness of `` sex and the city '' to daydream about any day of the week ! ) i 'm so pleased that remington steele has been released on dvd . i was seven years old when it debuted , and thoroughly enjoyed it at the time ( i was a sophisticated child ) . but i had n't seen it since , and once again , have found myself charmed by each and every episode . for those who are too young to remember the series , check it out - it 's much more worthwhile than anything on the air now , and for those of you who *do* remember it , revisit . it 's worth your time and money .
dvd	do n't buy this . `` from the grave '' is overdubbed b/w film without bruce lee in it . the other two are n't great either
dvd	the ab portion of the dvd is good , although i fast forward through the warm ups and skip the cool downs altogether . the buns workout is not challenging enough except for the first set . the last one is a step-type exercise so if you do n't have something you can step up on , you ca n't do it . the dvd itself is not very professionally done . tamilee miscounts , does n't look at the correct camera when speaking to the audience and often fumbles her words . abs of steel maybe , buns of steel , no way
dvd	i 've seen several pretty funny comedies this year , but none of them could touch what i watched saturday night . this dvd had it all , slapstick , funny costumes , hilarious sight gags , geeky dancing and more . there were times i was laughing so hard that my stomach hurt . i just could n't stop laughing and in fact spent most of the show with tears rolling down my cheeks . it was so funny , that i felt at a couple of points i was going to lose control of my bowels . yes , it 's that funny . i highly recommend this one , as it 's the closest thing i 've seen to the classic monty python days of english humor . i do n't know when i saw a movie that was non-stop hilarity , without a single moment of serious content . over two hours of complete madcap behaviour and a near fatal dose of cheese . the name of the dvd ? castles dreams , by an english comedy troupe called `` blackmore 's night '' . these guys are like a combination of monty python , benny hill and marty feldman . my sides are still aching ... .. those crazy f^king brits ... .
dvd	this is an excellent story well told in script and action . however , it is quite different from the version i saw on a big theater screen . this dvd has speeded up the action and the english translation dialogue is presented in such rapid changes that it is virtually impossible to read and follow the dialogue . i was very disapointed in this dvd version and would not recommend it to friends
dvd	i 've been a longtime fan of seagal 's movies , but i was greatly disappointed by this film . first , there were clearly sections where steven seagal 's voice was done by a different actor who sounds nothing like him . ( clearly done when the film was cut together after the main filming ) it was surprising that they could not take the time to get seagal to do the vocal tracks for those sections . there were also very few action sequences that demonstrated seagal 's skills with martial arts . in many ways , this film was more of a slasher flick than an action film . little action , but lots of bloody corpses lying about . i enjoyed black dawn far more , and feel it was a much better made film
dvd	got this on ebay for $ 18 last year - a great deal . i am only bothering to rate this as it seems ridiculous that is rated below two other rather shoddy grant collections because of the holiday backlash . objectively rating the content instead of the marketing would work for me
dvd	this is simply one of the best detective story ever made and jerry goldsmith 's sound track ( which i also own ) is probaby the best sound track . it was his favorite . jack , faye john are at their best
dvd	ga. how can anyone stand this drivel ? worst movie i ever watched repeatedly . worse than watching `` walk tall '' 8 times in a row . worse even than watching the home shopping network . eww . eww
dvd	francisco was right , this film is about as well-conceived as buttcrust . the review on the back of the dvd says `` jaw dropping , `` but the full quote probably reads `` jaw dropping ( because i was lulled to sleep like a baby ) '' . there is about 30 seconds of truly jaw dropping footage , in the zombie attack scenes , but these scenes only account for maybe 5 minutes of the movie . the rest of this film consists of the ear-bleeding whines and yawn-inducing infighting of the human characters , ill-conceived and extremely unlikable caricatures of a pseudo-cynical and extremely redundant `` evil side of human nature '' message that would be better left to jean renoir ( or even adam sandler considering the results here ) . i do n't watch zombie movies for the characters , especially characters so vapid and unengaging . it seemed like the script writer read a novice 's how to pamphlet and said `` yeah , it needs some conflict '' . if these characters were n't so constipated and bloated i 'd give them a chance . one amazon reviewer tries to justify all of the one-dimensional absurdity by crowning it with the weighty title of `` social commentary , '' but that 's just a mindless knee-jerk observation that fails to ascertain whether it was carried out sucessfully . it was n't . you 'd get more insight watching a kid frying ants with a magnifying glass . the critical ambitions of this movie are ill-fitting and embarassing , and ultimately just plain disappointing since they allot almost no time to showcase the director 's real talent , which is ( you guessed it ) the lovely undead . the rest is monotonous dreck . i do n't know why horror directors have so much insecurity about the worth of their strengths that they feel they need to shroud them in a poor man 's dramatic rags . all that aside , the ending is the worst anticlimatic cop-out in the history of horror movies . a horror movie that sucks for 3/4 of its duration needs a cool climax to redeem itself , but the cut-away at the end makes you wan na kick the director in the gonads . sorry , but anyone who calls this a classic is a friggin soundbite-repeating moron .
dvd	this one is an old favorite of mine , which i pre-ordered on dvd the instant i learned it was available . i have an old vhs recording of the film , which i have viewed many times . i have also read the book many times , and i consider it to be conroy 's best work . this is the story of four young men at carolina military institute , a fictional military academy located in south carolina , which is of course a pseudonym for the citadel , which is a fine military academy that really does exist . the film is set in the 1960s . the first black cadet ( first year cadets are called `` knobs '' at the institute ) has just arrived . a secret society within the institute , known as `` the ten '' has pledged that no black will ever graduate from the institute , regardless of ability . david keith turns in his customary excellent performance as the black cadet 's designated mentor . the plot moves at a fast pace , but nevertheless does not feel rushed . purists have criticized the fact that the film leaves out many sub-plots contained in the novel . i feel that the movie made the right choices about what to keep and what to delete , and of course these choices had to be made unless this was to be a 12 hour miniseries . i liked the script , the acting , and the ending . this is a wonderful film . it is the type of film that most viewers will watch periodically over the years , and i am delighted that it will shortly be available on dvd .
dvd	i was so excited when i read the reviews for this intermediate level pilates tape . thought i would purchase it for variety from my 'the method ' pilates tape . i was very disappointed . the tape does not even allow you to get your heart racing much less to break a sweat . i did n't feel like i got a good tone workout . i actually wanted to fall asleep . i felt it was 40 minutes of stretch for an intermediate level student . i give two stars because i do believe he knows what is talking about in terms of form but i shall be passing this on to an elderly relative
dvd	by the title i would be led to believe that there is more than one george story . there is one george and a few others , one of which scares my 2 1/2 year old . i thought the stories would be animated . however , some ( including george ) are pictures from a story book . we love to read books , but videos should be more than photos of a story book . would not recommend this
dvd	saw this movie at a sneak preview as i could not wait for it to be released . wonderful awesome feel good movie . i bought the 2004 calendar and was anxious for the movie 's release on dvd . fabulous acting by all of the ladies . get this movie watch it with your mom ! ! also recommended : the full mont
dvd	this movie had many of the ingredients to make it truly great , including a phenomenal cast , lead by cate blanchett , and great scenery and cinematography . the actors playing elizabeth , cecil , and walsingham spoke and acted admirably , each phrase spoken with such honesty and feeling , but the words themselves rendered the performances useless . the director and the author of the script greatly misunderstood the characters and the material . they should have read elizabeth the first 's biography by elizabeth jenkins . it is useless to say a movie does not need to be historically accurate but has only to entertain : had the author and director been more historically accurate , they would not have created the unbelievable character they created in elizabeth , who is in turn hysterical , defeatist , overbearing , childish , tyrannical , who never shows her core intelligence , her great love of her people , who had a private core described by her motto `` semper eadem '' , be always one . elizabeth ruled with her advisors , she was not totally ruled by them . she would not have put up with norfolk screaming at her across the council table , nor would burleigh have allowed it . cate blanchett 's wonderful acting and presence were pearls thrown before swine , wasted on a character portrayal that totally lacked any integrity , much less truth . how could the director think that the woman he was trying to portray was any kind of real woman ? the ending had me blushing with embarassment for one and all . we are laughably given william cecil as wimpy and ineffective , and walsingham as the mastermind behind the throne . one of the reviews said that the director inspired rush to play walsingham much like the hindu god krishna . i suggest that he should have first read some english history
dvd	this little girl lives by herself , its wild how she lives , and what out for that white powder ! mario is her only friend . and trap door is a goner
dvd	`` st. elmo 's fire '' is one of those movies that could have been better , should have been better and yet , it just was n't . it featured an ensemble cast of the young and hot stars of the 1980s , the so-called brat pack ( well , everyone but molly ringwald and anthony michael hall , who were spared this misstep ) . maybe this was supposed to be `` the breakfast club - - after college '' , but while `` the breakfast club '' had characters , even stereotypical characters , that you could relate to , there is absolutely no one , with the exception of emilio estevez ' character , that you care enough about to relate to in this film . the setting is not the john hughes teen friendly illinois , but georgetown , where our bunch of brat packers have supposedly graduated from college . uh-huh . yeah , right . judd nelson and ally sheedy are living together and supposedly looking toward marriage - - problem is , nelson is looking at and screwing everything else female that walks by and somehow hoping that sheedy , in her prim and proper sweater and skirt sets and pearls can change that . andrew mccarthy is their mutual friend who knows what nelson is up to and secretly harboring a festering desire for sheedy ( or maybe it 's just the pearls ? ) emilio estevez is a future attorney , working as a waiter/server and suffering a serious crush on andie macdowell . mare winningham is a dowdy , trust-fund type girl who is still holding on to her virginity , working in social services and fighting over marrying the proper dork that her parents have selected for her . she instead fantasizes about rob lowe , who is the pretty boy sax player in a local band , who has dropped out of school , married a white trash-y looking groupie , had a child with her and has now separated from her , and taking up with other groupies . demi moore is the wild chick who works in international banking , has a serious coke problem , stepmother issues and a problem with painting her apartment walls hot pink and with giant murals of billy idol . sounds promising , huh ? well , in what is an early portend of the `` melrose place '' to come , sheedy finds out what a dog nelson is , dumps his ass , immediately jumps into bed with mccarthy , who is too desperately in love with her to realize that this is a rebound job ; estevez , after screwing up a lucrative house-sitting job by hosting a party there , travels to the snowy mountains to track down macdowell and profess his love to her . he finds that she is holed up there with her boyfriend and despite being crushed , he lays a huge kiss on her and then heads back home . lowe , in between faux-playing his sax and shaking his feathered head everywhere , takes winningham 's virginity and heads back to his estranged missus . moore , after whining seemingly incessantly about her ill stepmother , has all her furnishings repossessed , loses her job and freaks out . not exactly `` the breakfast club '' . the real problems seem to lie in the characters themselves . with the exception of estevez ' character , they all seem like caricatures and horribly stereotyped . their every action , every line of dialogue seems like just that - - they seem very one dimensional . their so-called angst seems like a handy plotline device and nothing more than that . winningham 's character could have been salvagable - -except that she followed lowe around like a sick puppy , knowing full well how he mistreated his wife and what a basic slacker he was . and yet , she still gave her virginity to him . maybe if winningham was n't so bright , or she was a college freshman , it would be understandable . but she was a college graduate and seemingly intelligent . lowe really had little to do with his role . maybe if he had played the role nelson had - - as the roving lothario , with sheedy waiting at home , it might have gone over better . with his too-pretty looks , it would almost be understandable how the character could get random women he just met to sneak into dressing rooms with him . nelson just does n't seem comfortable and does n't pull it off - -but maybe nelson might have been better suited for the sax player . moore basically plays herself - -an interesting sidenote is that she was originally fired from this production for her drug problems , mirroring her character - - but was later rehired . while the title song later become a minor hit , `` st. elmo 's fire '' itself missed the mark .
dvd	it is the declining days of the great war ( wwi ) , the germans are leaving a small french town but are leaving a little present for the advancing british troops . they have buried the munitions in the town square . when the town hall clerk strikes midnight the bomb will be exploded . the town 's people evacuate . during this the barber sends off a message to the british . the british decide to send a man to check this out . they choose the bumbling scottish private plumpick ( alan bates ) . located on the outskirts of town is an asylum . the sisters who run the asylum escape with the town 's people , leaving the inmates to fend for themselves . they return to the town , resuming their lives before being commited . plumpick arrives in town but does n't know that the towns people are actually the lunatics from the asylum . he meets the beautiful coquelicat ( genevieve bujold ) and falls in love with her . he finally puts everything together and defuses the bomb ( of course it 's more complex and hilarious than just that . ) he also finally puts together that there is something wrong with the town 's people . the funny part is he feels the lunatics have a better grasp on reality the sane people . so shall he return to the war or stay with people he loves . this is half fairy tale and half fable . alan bates gives a great performance and genevieve bujold shows great whimsy . dvd extras : none
dvd	`` all men can do anything , if they will '' seems to be the final statement of this captivating picture , carefully directed by agnieszka holland , one of the major female directors in the world . this absorbing drama turns around the lives and times of three children who will meet each one another and exchange livings and fortunate encounters . on one hand , our little girl will know the world is not turning around her ; and her initial solitude will be rewarded when she found out a hiddden that will make her dreams come true , and finally she will the one in order to impluse and bring back her cousin to the life . a triumph of the cinema and definitively one of my top twenty best films of the nineties .
dvd	damn . there 's nothing remarkable about the second item on this dvd ; it 's your standard european-made sexploitation film . `` the wild , wild world of jayne mansfield , '' on the other hand , is reprehensible . it 's a hodge-podge of vacation footage of mansfield , clips from her movie project , and material entirely unrelated to mansfield , linked only by the voiceover ... and then , after an hour or so of light-hearted softcore buffoonery , the movie cuts to her death , spending the last twenty minutes obsessing on her husband and children and the large , mostly empty mansion she has left behind . this movie has the feel of something slapped together for the sole purpose of trading off a famous name after mansfield 's death . this is exploitation in its worst form . i found the sudden change in tone , the large volume of non-mansfield material , and the sheer obsessiveness of the last twenty minutes disgusting in the extreme . those looking for cheesy bad movies to enjoy , or softcore porn to tittilate , go elsewhere ; this one is not merely bad , but evil
dvd	i saw this movie on tv years ago and loved it . i thought the storyline was terrific . there 's plenty of action , family situations , love interest , but , mostly , this movie engages you -- it forces you to care about the characters . it 's a great movie . three words : keep tissues handy
dvd	another film in the never-ending series of `` giant animated snake eats people '' films that have been plaguing us for almost a decade . the creators of a maximum-security prison in the antarctic drill into a hollow rock formation and disturb the ten-million-plus slumber of 80-foot hungry reptile . there 's nothing more to this film than that . `` boa '' ( also known as `` new alcatraz '' ) actually takes itself seriously instead of reveling in its silliness , which i do n't think was a smart idea . the technical team - photography , production design-set decoration , etc . - create a fairly effective , chilling atmosphere , but everything else about `` boa '' is strictly routine . dean cain does a job i would describe as tolerable , although elizabeth lackey is just that - lacking - as his wife , and the supporting cast ( mark sheppard , grand l. bush , craig wasson ) is just a touch more professional . the film-makers actually make the wise move of mostly keeping the snake in the dark so we ca n't see just how fake it looks . i do n't really recommend it unless you actually happen to enjoy this sort of thing to begin with ; other , similar titles include `` python '' 1 and 2 , `` anaconda '' ( the original hokey animated killer snake movie of 1997 ) and `` anaconda : search for the blood orchid '' , and the inevitable `` boa vs. python '' . the dvd includes a few trailers and filmographies for the director and principal actors . 2/
dvd	i gave my boyfriend the most romantic presents ever for valentine 's day , but this is still the one he talks about the most . he loved having all the seasons and this was the best price i found anywhere .
dvd	i understand that some fans would like to see more of their loved characters ( this series is one of the best as far as i 'm concerned ) , and i can understand the need in filling in a gap especually if the show has n't been aired in a while on tv : but i can not understand anyone who buys this dvd for any reason . you do not need this dvd to `` fill the gap in your collection . '' they did the same thing with chobits in episode 7 , another damn recap . there 's no point in watching it . the series is great , stick to the episodes both before and after this dvd . trust me , i know how tempting it is to either rent this episode , get it on netflix , or go out and buy it outright ... but do n't . you 'll only be sorry . there are a myriad of reasons why the company made this dvd ( posted elsewhere ) but what 's important is that it is a waste of time and money . great series ( a+ ) , this dvd = f .
dvd	it is a tragedy that brandon lee died while making this film . had he lived , the crow sequels would have been much better . the crow is an action packed movie that moves at a quick pace . it set the standard for the dark cinema of the 1990 's .
dvd	take some talented actors and put them in an age old story of smart kids versus dumb adults and you get more of the same . really , is this the type of movie we want to pawn off on our kids ? they deserve better . the key point of this movie is that lying is bad . good point . a device used to bring out the truth is creative pranks . also good . unfortunately , the pranks fall flat as they are totally implausible ( even kids will have a hard time believing a man ca n't tell he 's been dyed blue until he looks in the mirror ) , and since they are the device used to bring the movie to its conclusion , the entire thing falls flat . making films for children is a fine thing . they should n't be dumbed down or even given an uncritical eye just because they are for children , however . quite honestly , i 'd rather have a kid watch something like `` good will hunting '' before this . do n't waste your children 's time with this film . read them a book ... a good book ... instead
dvd	the dvd came in a timely manner , packaged well and i have had no problems with the item . it seems to be in great condition
dvd	what a horrific movie to gear towards children . it is extremely violent and just plain creepy ! the scene where the dog is hanging from a chain and drowning in water was so wrong . i wish i could put 0 stars for this one . do not waste your money on this one
dvd	john waters is a very brilliant and odd film director . he brings camp , trash , filth , humor and morality to all of his movies , pushes peoples buttons , goes farther than most dare ( and then some ) isnt afraid of being censored and does what he does and to me thats brillance . true alot of people will think his work is tasteless stupid and gross but thats the whole point ! lol ! people who dont have a sense of humor or who are not open minded will not like his movies . these are not for right wing conservatives but they should see them ( especially a dirty shame ) to broaden their minds a little more . my personal favorites are pink flamingos , a dirty shame , female trouble , polyester and desperate living . serial mom is also a fav but not in this collection . he has come from underground trash to queen of filth , trash and crudeness and for not being afraid of being bold , outlandish , outspoken and bizzar , i applaud you john waters . brillant
dvd	hard to believe it took me until now ( february 2007 ) to finally see this excellent movie and witness the brutal language and the violent gun shootings that made scarface so popular and award-deserving back in the early 80 's . i loved this movie . it really delivers with the action and the characters are all interesting , especially tony montana . a movie that deserves to be as lengthy as it is ( over 2 hours ) . everyone must see scarface at least once in their lifetime . it wo n't disappoint . the ending gave me goosebumps it was *that* good and intense . watch it now
dvd	i saw this movie in theaters probably when it first came out in 2001 , but i did n't pay too close attention , because i forgot about it . however , i remembered seeing it in theaters one day when i was browsing the dvd section , and decided to give it another shot at home . i am so glad i did ! leelee sobieski is absolutely gourgeous and did a flawless job with the film . she has a bright future in acting ahead of her . basically what happens is , ruby ( sobieski ) and her brother rhett 's ( trevor morgan ) parents die in a car accident . their parents wished for them to go live with the family 's former neighbors , the glasses , ( who had since moved to malibu ) played by stellan skarsgard and diane lane . needless to say , ruby and rhett 's carefree lives are changed dramatically . rhett falls for all the gifts that the glasses buy for him , but ruby is n't fooled so easily . she begins to suspect that her parents ' death was n't an accident , and starts to investigate . she sees certain things and observes certain behaviors exhibited by the glasses that only make her more suspicious . eventually , she figures out that the glasses are behind the car accident and are now after ruby and rhett 's 4 million dollar fortune that was left to them by their parents . i wo n't give away the rest , but the movie takes you on a roller coaster ride of excitement and suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the last second ! rent it , or better yet , buy it ! it 's well worth your while !
dvd	having just read the book ( most highly recommended ) i decided to treat myself to the movie . i could have cried . while i did not expect the movie to contain everything from the book , i was sadly dissapointed to see that it totally changed the plot around . in the book , the 5 men bonded together and were great men of character . in the movie , they got rid of one man , had the other eaten right off the bat , pencroft is shown to be a coward and greedy . in the book , nemo appears only in the last two or three chapters , and he does not have an elaborate home on the island . and what about those stupid giant animals ? i do n't recall reading about them . the fence around nemo 's home looks like it came right from jurassic park . the whole story was about 5 ( eventually 6 ) men who were stranded on an uncharted island and the wonderful adventures they had there . on another note , the graphics were pretty bad . the panning was very blurry and the picture was often grainy . as one reviewer well said , it is suitable for children who are easily pleased , but it is nothing like the book . perhaps this is why amazon sells it for only $ 6.99
dvd	release the bats is definatly one of my favorite dvds i own . it will show you a side of pete wentz and others you may or may not want to see ... i thought it was very interesting to see and its kind of cool to see another side others may not have . you also get to find out who dirty is or whatever . pete says things about him in a couple of places ( online ) and all i could think is `` who is that ? '' so thats also very exciting . i would say as long as you have a good sense of humor your pretty much safe buying this . remember : its the stuff deemed 'unfit ' for `` my heart with always be the b-side to my tongue
dvd	i saw this movie in a trip and it is one of the worst movies i have seen during the last two years . stupid , stupid and stupid . ryan reynolds becomes annoying . if you have brain , never watch this movi
dvd	pablo francisco is like michael jordan on the wizards . he just isnt as good as he used to be . i hope he proves me wrong in future material . save yourself some money and get his old work .
dvd	crackerjack courtroom trial drama based on a true story of three australian soldiers in the boer war accused of killing prisoners and a dutch minister . the british command is obviously using the three as scapegoats to convince the germans , who seem eager to join the war on the side of the boers , to stay out . the men claim they were only following orders , orders which went against `` normal '' military practice . this is a new type of warfare : the boers fought as guerrillas , not in uniform , not by `` the rules . '' the australians on trial felt they were engaging them on those terms . the morality of war itself , therefore , is just as much on trial as these men . they all lose in the end . the trial scenes are well paced , and the use of flashback creates just the right amount of tension . also there are enough shady gray areas to keep the proceedings interesting . well worth a watch
dvd	for better or worse , after the relative box-office slump of on her majesty 's secret service , producers brocolli and saltzman decided to woo sean connery back to do one more film for an amazing sum . connery , who had said he would never do another bond film , donated all of his money to his own foundation . while his performance is competent and smooth as ever , he seems all business . no longer in love with the character and having realized long before that the character was stagnant , connery mechanically works his way through diamonds are forever , an outright bore of the bond series and , in my opinion , one of the worst ( certainly connery 's worst ) . while some have tried to save the film by arguing that it is a parody of the bond genre , it plainly is n't . it was an attempt to return bond to his former glory days and generate profit for the producers . far from trying to lampoon the bond formula , the producers were trying to resuscitate it . and they failed . after the opening `` gun barrel '' sequence , we quickly find bond on a personal mission to kill blofeld once and for all after the death of bond 's only true wife ( discounting the false marriage in you only live twice ) in on her majesty 's secret service . ( at least , this is what we must assume , since no mention of the marriage is made in diamonds are forever ) . bond catches blofeld in the process of producing clones for himself in an underground laboratory and , after a couple of struggles with both blofeld and a duplicate , bond drowns blofeld in a vat of mud . it is a very short and quick opening teaser and immediately runs into the titles sequence . the titles involves various diamonds , slowly revealed to be various pieces jewelry worn by beautiful women , all set to the title song sung by shirley bassey ( who also sang the goldfinger title ) . the plot of diamonds are forever is quite strange . in an opening similar to goldfinger , we learn that large quantities of south african diamonds have been smuggled recently and yet , surprisingly , have not made their way to the market . worried that the diamonds will be released in order to inflate the diamond market , bond is sent in to infiltrate the smuggling operation , disguised as peter franks . bond quickly succeeds , meeting up with tiffany case ( jill st. john ) , an attractive diamond smuggler who is suspicious of bond 's identity . bond 's mission is almost compromised from the start when the real peter franks makes an entrance , forcing bond to fight him in a terrific elevator sequence that is reminiscent of the train fight in from russia with love . after a smuggling attempt goes awry ( thanks to bond ) , bond is discovered and learns of the real purpose of the operation he is infiltrating . it turns out that blofeld is behind it all ( bond killed only two duplicates in the opening teaser ) ! blofeld has been smuggling diamonds to create a laser satellite that is capable of destroying anything on earth . blofeld has been hiding his operation by posing as recluse willard whyte ( jimmy dean ) , whom he has secretly kidnapped unbeknownst to the world , and using whyte 's resources and industrial facilities to manufacture his powerful laser . blofeld plans to destroy various nuclear installations in america , russia , and china . the purpose ? blofeld is organizing an international auction , offering nuclear supremacy to the highest bidder ! will bond be able to stop him in time ? diamonds are forever feels like a film that was stitched together , rather poorly , from a myriad of interesting elements . one feels that the producers had a bunch of ideas on the cutting floor and attempted to piece them together into a logical story order . the infiltration of a smuggling ring , the wonderful fight sequence in the elevator , the quirky and gay hitmen mr. wint ( bruce glover ) and mr. kidd ( putter smith ) , a not-so-subtle rendition of the famous las vegas recluse howard hughes , a fight on an oil rig , et cetera . all of these elements are fairly interesting in their own right , but the combination does n't yield what the producers were hoping for . what is it about this film that feels so ridiculous ? one of the major problems , in my opinion , is situating bond in las vegas . bond in america is dull . his class , wit , and sophistication are only cheapened when placed in the cheesy context of las vegas in the 1970s . bond is supposed to take us to exotic locations -- not to a strip club . furthermore , the action is not quite on par with the rest of the series . i think everyone will agree that the chase scene in which bond escapes through the desert on a moon buggy is absurd . the chase is boring , the buggy looks ridiculous and prop-esque , and there is no suspense . the climactic fight on the oil rig is equally boring . sure , we have a big set and big explosions . but there is no cutting edge stuff here . connery , as mentioned , looks very tired here . tiffany case is a bit refreshing , but quickly becomes dim-witted and dull . and the bond girl with the clever name , plenty o'toole ( lana wood ) is only in the film for all of five minutes . blofeld is now played by charles gray , who first made his appearance as bond 's japan contact in you only live twice . gray 's performance takes blofeld back to the ridiculousness of you only live twice , even appearing in drag at one point . there is n't much more to say . the acting is dead in diamonds are forever . now , some have tried to defend diamonds are forever by claiming that the film is an outright attempt to make a parody of the bond genre . after producing six bond films , the producers were ready to lampoon their own creation and move bond into the roger moore pun-fest the series would eventually become . while this certainly seems to create an outlet for the film , it seems plainly false . if you watch the `` making of '' documentary on the ultimate edition , it is clear that everyone thought they were making a real bond flick and not a parody . the producers were trying to bring the series back to its former glory days and to produce big box-office success . they were not trying to create a subtle piece that exposed the hilarious features of the bond formula . anyone claiming otherwise is just engaging in wishful thinking and rationalization . this film stinks . let 's get over it . ultimately , i think you should skip diamonds are forever . the only reason to see it is if you are a completist about the series and desire to watch them in order . it is an awkward insert into the series during the transition between sean connery and roger moore . the ultimate edition does have crisp picture and sound . if you must struggle through the film , make sure to get this edition because it is at least watchable . but if you only desire to watch the better bond films , skip it . diamonds may be forever , but this film died a long time ago .
dvd	i think that anyone who believes this movie to be `` hilarious '' or hudson 's performance `` overrated '' and `` over-the-top '' in her singing just does n't like musicals . or perhaps does n't like an all black cast ( i am not black ) or is too young to understand the 60 's world of music and payola and backstabbing . while touted to be similar to the experiences suffered by the supremes with diana ross as its lead singer , it is close in some aspects and totally far away in others . the key words here are `` loosely based '' on the story of the supremes . why people , including ross herself do n't get that is beyond me ! over the top ? if anyone saw the original play with jennifer holliday ( i did see it ) then you do n't know the meaning of over the top . that character was supposed to be that way and hudson did a wonderful job of that . her performance overrated ? hogwash ! she deserved all the accolades she received as a novice actress . murphy did one of his best acting jobs ever ! beyonce 's performance was good but not great . this was in part because her character while prominent was not the focus of the movie nor was it of the play . this was beyonce 's best acting performance thus far though she still needs some work and the `` right '' role . this was not the right role for her in my opinion . hudson 's character is the main and central character which puzzles me for the `` supporting actress '' win . though as lead actress she probably would have lost . you people out there , do n't take my word for this movie 's greatness and take on a true part of history even if it was `` white-washed , '' no pun intended . or do n't think its a bad movie like some other critics here . you must judge for yourself . i hope and think that you wo n't be disappointed . there are some more than subtle references to the supremes and diana ross especially in some of the costumes , beyonce 's images and album covers ( cd covers for you youngsters ) but only die hard fans of the supremes and people who were there at that time would know that . enjoy
dvd	i knew that this concert dvd was an acoustic show so i was n't surprised that the tempo was slow at the beginning . but to start the show with gilmour tuning his guitar was a bit much . once he did start playing , gilmour was having such a hard time finding his rhythm that i found myself praying for the drums to kick in . by the time things settle down , the really glaring problem with this dvd comes to the surface . the mix is horrible . the crowd noise drowns out gilmour at times when they cheer a song they recognize , he is almost inaudible when talking between songs and at many points the backup singers completely cancel him out . i found myself constantly adjusting the volume which really takes away from the `` concert experience '' . there are high points in the show , but the low points are rock bottom . comfortably numb is a song that millions of people know by heart . two versions are provided on this dvd - from the concert and in the bonus section . neither of the guest singers ( robert hewitt and sir bob geldoff ) know the words , have to read from sheet music and based on their phrasing have never heard the song before . gilmour would have been better off asking for a volunteer from the audience . the very best thing on this dvd is , oddly enough , in the bonus section . screamin ' jay hawkins ' i put a spell on you , a blues standard performed with mica paris and jools holland , almost makes the dvd worth buying . almost . watch jonathan demme 's beautiful treatment of neil young : heart of gold if you really want to see a great acoustic show . that is the gold standard .
dvd	while this dvd was obviously filmed in the early 1970s with the picture quality to match at times , the genius of david bowie shines through . as adults too young to remember or have seen ziggy stardust , it was an amazing look at the time period . the sound quality is suprisingly good , although some camera angles are distracting at times . it was also neat to hear bowie 's pronouncement of `` this is our last tour ever . '' little did he know ... this dvd is worth every penny . rock on
dvd	i was fourteen years old when i attended the new york premier of this movie at the rivoli theater . i have the original premier book from the theater ; which is not for sale . i immediately fell in love with the beautiful ingrid bergman . so did millions of other young men . this movie did not win the award of the year ; it was overshadowed by `` casablanca '' ; which in my estimation , was of inferior quality , compared to for whom the bell tolls . bob richard
dvd	i purchased this dvd because it said it was an easier pilates video to do ; basically anyone , even beginners , could do it . i have to disagree . i started this video and tried to do all of the 5 , ten minute sections . it was n't completely hard , but definitely challenging . i am not the most fit person , but also not the most unfit . i had a harder time because i am just not as limber as you should be to use this pilates video . i am not saying i would n't suggest it , i am just saying it 's not definitely for beginners . however , the instructions are clear and since it 's broken up into the five-ten minute sections it gets even lazy people like me to get off the couch and do it
dvd	a wonderful movie which deserved all the awards which were bestowed upon it . it is refreshing to view great movies with wonderful stories minus bad language and nudity . as a big fan of greer garson , i must comment on jane bedinger 's review in which she claimed that ms. garson was having an `` affair '' with the actor who played her son . ms. garson fell in love with and married richard ney about a year after the movie was made . i do n't see how ms. bedinger could consider this an `` affair '' .
dvd	a pure and engaging story of redemption amongst family , `you can count on me ' tells the story of sammy ( laura linney ) and terry prescott ( mark ruffalo ) , siblings who lost their parents in a horrific car crash when they were still very young . years later and sammy is a single mother of 8-year-old rudy ( rory culkin ) , she works hard at her job at the bank , now run by over critical brain everett ( matthew broderick ) , and she struggles with telling her son just how much of a jerk his father really is ( josh lucas has a great cameo as rudy senior ) . when terry shows up after months of no communication sammy is immediately thrilled , but shortly after his arrival she realizes her brother is still a screw-up and is just using her , again . terry shows up in need of money to pay for his girlfriend 's abortion , but when his girlfriend tries to commit suicide he decides he needs to take a break from his life and so he stays with sammy and rudy . over the course of a few weeks terry has made a deep impact , especially in the life of young rudy who idolizes him . this film follows the changes each of these siblings make , changes in themselves but also changes they cause others to make . it 's a beautiful story of redemption and acceptance and it should n't be missed . the performances by the two leads are outstanding , and young rory culkin is adorable and mature as sammy 's son , but the real shock to me was matthew broderick who played the demanding , philandering , unlikable type brilliantly , and he 's not one i 'm generally impressed with
dvd	i read the various reviews about the movie `` the hunter '' . i was surprised at the extremeties in preference . much like owning a fiero , . . . . which i do . the movie , as is the fiero , is overall slower than most of mcqueen 's . however , he still pulls it off , showing his great acting ability . when you take the character , `` papa '' thorson , he was a different breed in the wrong time era . who else , but mcqueen could make him so realistic ? i have n't seen the movie in several years . i have been wanting a copy to add to my library . i intend to do that today . oh yeah , the relationship between the movie and the fiero ? i have found that there are those that either dearly love it or wish they had never laid eyes on it . i loved `` the hunter '' and i love my fiero . for those of you who do n't understand , . . . `` sorry '' ! steve mcquen displayed more of his talent , even while ill. god bless you , steve and thank you for the entertainment you gave us
dvd	this exercise video was very easy to get started on and you could do all the exercises in very limited space . this is great for people who do not have alot of room . after exercising to the video , i felt really good , energized . i would definitely recommend it to someone who is just starting out exercising . it is low impact and easy to follow
dvd	the star trek collection is a worthy hobby and certainly the largest of the television series dvd collections ( the original series , the next generation , deep space nine , voyager and enterprise ) . at around 1100 minutes per box ( a few hours less than the tos seasons ) we are still looking at approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing . that is 1 month of non-stop star trek . no dvd series comes remotely close to that . get going collecting right now and build up on each succession over the years . by the end you will have a very serious anthology that defines the word awe . this is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next few years . it is a cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your children also . our very planet , earth , has advanced because of gene roddenberry 's admirable concept . roddenberry nailed the premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a show with characters that we could look up too . `the bridge ' members are like our family . watch what they do . then go and spend your life striving for the same on earth . what engineer , medic , scientist , teacher , worker can not say that star trek has not influenced them ? the show is this significant in the development of our species . even christians respect and quote its authority and it is not hard to see why . the dvd case is not quite as fancy as the tos ( the original series ) cases . the tng case is supposed to resemble a tng crew briefcase . the case opens to reveal the disc booklet inside a sleeve . sliding the disc booklet out of the sleeve and flipping it open reveals a spread of 7 discs . there are 4 episodes per disc . however the last disc , disc 7 , only has two episodes , for a grand total of 26 episodes ( tos has 8 discs , 30 episodes ) . the rest of disc 7 is devoted to star trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected extras ... and then some more . the episodes are ordered not in the sequence they where filmed , but in the sequence that they aired , however each episode has been numbered according to the order they where filmed in . this means on one disc you have shows 4 , 2 , 12 and 1 , in that order . the sound has also been remastered to 5:1 dolby digital ! since the show was shot in full frame , these dimensions are retained . star trek , the next generation ( tng ) , season one , had an amazing impact when it was first broadcast . an instant hit and a milestone in television serials ( it ran for 7 seasons unlike its predecessor that ran for 3 ) , its characters and new look enterprise had us glued to the tv with the first computer generated images of our solar system as captain picard utters the immortal words ... `to baldly ' ... i mean ... `to boldly go where no man ' ... i mean ... `to boldly go where no one has gone before . ' viewing the episodes in the order they where filmed does not show a vision in the shaping as per the tos series but is more of the same again ( even remaking some tos episodes ) , this time with more characters , more action and more special effects . season 1 all of the main characters in the tng series are in episode one , captain jean-luc picard , commander william t. riker , lieutenant/lt . commander geordi la forge , lieutenant tasha yar , lieutenant worf , commander dr. beverly crusher , lt. commander/commander deanna troi , lt . commander data and ensign wesley crusher . only natasha yar quits before the first season is finished . commander dr. beverly crusher is replaced by doctor katherine pulaski for season two . ensign wesley crusher is only sometimes reoccurring after season four . the enterprise itself is beautifully rendered with additional areas such as the holodeck allowing for almost any environment at the users choosing , playing an important function in many episodes . the use of computer generated images ( a ground-breaking television experience back in 1987 ! ) allowed for inspirational subspace sequences , planets , backdrops , an improved bridge main viewer and windows ! advances in makeup effects brought new alien characters to life and allowed an actor to appear as if he where indeed an android . tng season one attempts to relate with tos by reviving similar stories while at the same time adding on additional insights into new and fascinating sci-fi theory while retaining most of the character arcs that made tos so interesting . the stories ( also written by tos 's dc fontana ) are as fresh today as they where in the late 80s , early 90s , when tng first aired . season one of tng is mostly about deities , infections , alien cultures , galactic politics , time travel , alien forces , mind control , family matters , computer malfunctions and starfleet academy . there are also the unforgettable episodes `encounter at farpoint ' which introduces us to the crew of the enterprise and the mysterious q , `where no one has gone before ' a wonderful story about travelling the cosmos , `datalore ' which features two data characters , `heart of glory ' with some in-depth revelations about klingons , `skin of evil ' featuring some remarkable effects for its time with a very sad ending , and the classic `conspiracy ' ( this episode is uncut , which features some violent scenes involving a head explosion edited from some daytime television showings [ so parents be cautious ] ) about an invasion of the body snatchers type takeover of starfleet . the bottom line for tng : season one is that it will bring back some enormously delightful memories for those who where awe inspired by it when it first came out . although we can debate about which is the better series , tng or tos , we still absolutely adore both . we might miss kirk rolling about the desert scrub with a seven foot man in a rubber reptile costume , but hearing picard saying `make it so ' just makes our day . season 2 season two , still carries on with repeating much of the stories in tos , revamping them and then adding some new stuff of its own , boosting data 's screen time , bumping up the computer generated graphics to allow for things like shuttlecraft launching and manoeuvres , improved alien cgi and an enhancement in particle effects . they even attempt a type of morphing . most of the main characters from season one are here , captain jean-luc picard , commander william t. riker ( now with a beard ) , lieutenant commander geordi la forge , lieutenant commander worf ( letting his hair grow ) , commander deanna troi ( complete with low-cut red starfleet costume ) , lt . commander data and ensign wesley crusher . however obviously commander lieutenant tasha yar is gone but so is dr. beverly crusher ( who was not bad-looking ) , replaced by doctor katherine pulaski ( who looks like your granny ! ) for season two because dr. crusher has been reassigned to starfleet medical as explained in episode one of season three ( in reality the tng writers where having difficulties in developing crusher 's character , would later reinstate her for season three , dropping pulaski because they felt her character was not working ) . colm meaney as miles edward o'brien , navigation from season one gets more screentime , while the new whoopi goldberg chatacter , guinan , is the wise el aurian bartender in 10 forward , the new bar room where the enterprise crew get to relax . except for this extra area the enterprise itself has not gone undergone much of a revamp and this season is far more enterprise based than season one , or all of tos , meaning season two has less planetary exploration stories which is a bit of a drawback , but sets a new standards in the `hotel in space ' feel that would produce the `deep space nine ' series . season two of tng is mostly about alien impregnation , mystery space , ai , the holodeck , interplanetary relations , rapid aging , justice , shape-shifting , time travel , family , the prime directive , kidnapping , cloning , war games and infections . the big plus side to not having that much planetary exploration is that there are lots of stories with klingons and the first encounter with the borg ! the unforgettable episodes are , `elementary , dear data ' where data takes on his sherlock holmes persona and we are introduced to the moriarty character . `loud as a whisper ' is about a deaf and dumb peace negotiator . `a matter of honor ' is where riker serves on a klingon battleship . `q who ? ' may well be the best episode here because it is the first time we meet the borg . the last episode of season two `shades of gray ' may be one of the worst star trek episodes ever , which uses riker 's memories from seasons one and two to make up an entire episode and even includes the uncut scenes for the season one episode `conspiracy ' featuring the violent head explosion edited from some daytime television showings [ so parents be cautious again ] ) . the bottom line for tng : season two is that for all it shortcomings because of lack of beaming down , we get the borg and lots and lots of klingons . at this stage in the saga we might still miss kirk rolling about the desert scrub with a seven foot man in a rubber reptile costume , but how will picard defeat those assimilating half-man , half-machine entities that are heading his way ? he better `` make it so '' with season three . season 3 it was the dawn of the 90s and since cgi had undergone some development , the improvements can be seen not only in the new opening sequence , but with better looking planets ( complete with moving gaseous atmospheres ) and major enhancements in particle effects . towards the end it undergoes new model development , lighting and subspace effects of a movie budget look . the crew uniform has changed with a new type of collar . most of the main characters from season two are here , captain jean-luc picard , commander william t. riker ( now with a bigger belly ) , lieutenant commander geordi la forge , lieutenant commander worf ( letting his hair grow even more ) , commander deanna troi ( with more makeup , costume changes and even an aerobics outfit [ that really is n't as good as it sounds ] ) , lieutenant commander data and ensign wesley crusher ( new hairdo ) . dr. beverly crusher is back ( initially with a terrible hairdo that gets better ) and doctor katherine pulaski has been dropped from the show never to reappear again . pulaski 's disappearance is not officially explained ( in reality diana muldaur was told her character was not working and she was offered a role in l.a. law instead . mcfadden was asked to rejoin the series again ) the crew do act like she has just left because her time was up with dr. crusher making reference to pulaski 's work in episode four . commander lieutenant tasha yar makes a surprise guest appearance for one episode ! dwight schultz ( murdoch from the a-team ) makes his first appearance as lieutenant `reg ' barkley , who would have a reoccurring role . colm meaney is here again as miles edward o'brien , navigation , does n't have much of a role boost since season two , while the whoopi goldberg 's guinan character of the wise el aurian , the bartender in 10 forward , has her background further developed . season three of tng is mostly about nanotechnology , colonization , super aliens , the prime directive , orphans , ancient space booby traps , romulans , wormholes , peace negotiations , defectors , super humans , terrorism , q , court inquisitions , parallel universes , ai , klingon high councils , captivity experiments , time travellers , biological space crafts , morale , the first law of robotics , vulcans , sarek , evolutionary speciation , and the borg . unlike season two there is much more planetary exploration and lots of alien encounters . there are loads of unforgettable episodes in this season , `` evolution '' where nanotechnology takes over the enterprise , `` the survivors '' is a mystery about a single household that is the only structure to survive an alien invasion on a whole planet , `` who watches the watchers ? '' is about the prime directive failing when the enterprise team are spotted and kidnapped , `` offspring '' sees data creating another sentient android , `` sins of the father '' has worf return to his klingon homeworld to defend his family honour , `` hollow pursuits '' has lt. barkley fantasizing about crew members in the holodeck , `` sarek '' is about the vulcan of the same name from star trek : the original series , who is back for what looks like his final peace negotiation , and of course the pot-boiler end episode of `` the best of both worlds , part i '' ( widely acclaimed as one of the best star trek episodes ever ! ) marks the grand entrance of locutus of borg onto the scene . the bottom line for tng : season three is that it is often cited by fans as the best tng season and is probably the first of the seasons to really be worth the price tag demanded of these very expensive box sets . in season three everyone seems to have matured , included the writers who are giving us exactly what we want and the series has a serious enough budget to make every episode look like a movie , especially towards the end . there is lots in this season to enjoy and of course not since j.r. ewing had been shot did we get the kind of cliff-hanger episode that `` the best of both worlds , part i '' would deliver on , meaning every trekie ( and who was n't at this time ) across the planet from la to hong kong had to wait all summer to learn how picard could be saved . there is no time to loose ! ! ! onto season four . ... . wooosshhhh . season 4 not since j.r. ewing had been shot did we get the kind of cliff-hanger episode that `` the best of both worlds , part i '' would deliver on at the end of season iii , meaning every trekie ( and who was n't at this time ) across the planet from la to hong kong had to wait all summer to learn how picard could be saved . there was no time to lose ! ! ! onto season four . ... . wooosshhhh ... so here we are . with season three it was the dawn of the 90s and cgi had undergone some development and improvements ( better looking planets with moving gaseous atmospheres , particle effects , lighting and subspace effects ) . with season three things started to have more of a movie budget look . season four tries to maintain that class . most of the main characters from season two are here , captain jean-luc picard , commander william t. riker , lieutenant commander geordi la forge , lieutenant commander worf ( who keeps growing that hair ) , commander deanna troi , lieutenant commander data , dr. beverly crusher and ensign wesley crusher ( now a starfleet officer with full uniform , also departs from tng half way through this season , and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining three seasons ) . colm meaney is here again as miles edward o'brien and whoopi goldberg 's guinan . lots of characters who had small episode roles are back for season four such as worf 's lover k'ehleyr , the traveller , k'mpec the klingon leader , duras whose dishonesty caused worf 's discommendation and the romulan tomalak . there is also a surprise character at the end of this season . season four of tng is mostly about the borg , family , dr. soong and the ai emotion chip , adoption , the space-time continuum , hostage rescue , the klingon high council , romulans , alternative universes , holographic projection , survival , loosing special abilities , renegade captains , the devil , amnesia , first contact , love , nightmares , mutations , super intelligence , robin hood , witch hunt trials , euthanasia , host life forms , mind control and honour . like season three most the episodes in season four have great stories , combining both planetary exploration and the life of the crew instead of dealing with either one or the other as the initial seasons did . it is a well balanced season overall and a good deal more exciting than maybe its three previous seasons now that things are firmly established . apart from containing part ii of `the best of both worlds ' , the introduction of the cardassians , who would become major players in the star trek : deep space nine franchise , makes it even more valuable . there are loads of unforgettable episodes in this season , `the best of both worlds , part ii ' concludes the cliff-hanger from season three with some great battle special effects , `family ' has picard going home to see his brother and family , `brothers ' features dr. soong who is data 's creator , `reunion ' returns to the story of worf and his klingon dishonour , `the wounded ' features the cardassians for the first time , `clues ' has data disobeying picard , `first contact ' sees riker exposed as an alien on a planet he is monitoring , the `the nth degree ' has barclay taking control of the enterprise with his new special powers of intelligence , `qpid ' for its historical recreation of robin hood and of course `redemption , part i ' which deals with worf 's dishonour . the bottom line for tng : season four is that it keeps up the pace of season three , and is worth the price tag demanded of these very expensive box sets . everyone has matured and the writers are giving us exactly what we want . although not quite the cliff-hanger end episode that `` the best of both worlds , part i '' was , `redemption , part i ' still concerns the loss of a main character to the other side and introduces the surprise return of a person we know . we are left asking ourselves , if the `hard man ' is really gone and why does `she ' look like a romulian ! as picard would say `` i can live with a mystery '' but we just ca n't ! onto season five as quick as we can ... season 5 season 5 has a remarkable improvement in visual effects . the display panels on the enterprise are more interactive . the camera can now pan as special effects take place . deep space battles seem more intense . we also get a new star trek title graphic in the opening sequence . the cliff-hanger conclusion of `` redemption , part ii '' is a great episode although slightly lacking in the promise of a civil war battle between klingons , romulans and the federation , turns out to be more of a character episode than the big epic battler we thought we would get . none-the-less , it is still a good episode that reveals some things about the family of tasha yar . most of the main characters from season two are here , captain jean-luc picard ( with a new red suede coat and grey uniform ) , commander william t. riker , lieutenant commander geordi la forge ( who sports a new beard in one episode ) , lieutenant commander worf ( who left the enterprise in season four ) , commander deanna troi , lieutenant commander data and dr. beverly crusher . ensign wesley crusher ( who departed from season four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining three seasons ) returns for some episodes but is mainly replaced by the new ensign ro laren , a bajoran . colm meaney is here again as miles edward o'brien as is whoopi goldberg 's guinan . alexander rozhenko as worf 's son now has a reoccurring role since season four . keiko o'brien , ( miles o'brien 's wife ) is firmly established as a reoccurring character . watch out for the special appearances of ashley judd as ensign robin lefler and leonard nimoy as spock ! whoot ! whoot ! strangely enough this is the only season where q , of the omnipotent q continuum , does not make an appearance . lieutenant reginald barclay , engineer is also absent from this season . season four of tng is mostly about the klingon high council , romulans , communication , bajora , crystalline entities , disasters , addiction , reunification , time travel , parenting , telekinesis , eugenics , amnesia , possession , euthanasia , sexual repression , time warps , children , cover-ups , sexual attraction , imaginary friends , borg , invisibility , alternative lives and phase shifting . like season four most the episodes in season five have great stories , a perfect balance of planetary exploration and the life of the crew . it much more of the same as in season four with the better episodes being `redemption , part ii ' , `darmok ' an interesting episode about language , the introduction of the bajora and ensign ro , the silicon avatar makes a return , `unification ' , part i and ii ( both here ) with spock may be one of the most popular double episodes in the whole tng franchise , certainly more popular than `time 's arrow ' , part i which ends this season with the possibility of something strange happening to data on earth . `the masterpiece society ' shows what happens when a special genetically engineered race has contact from the outside world . huge of borg also makes his first appearance in `i , borg ' . apart from the `unification ' double episode , the instalments `ethics ' , about worf undergoing a major controversial surgical operation and `the game ' , when entertainment becomes mind control , have both achieved cult status as some of the best tng episodes ever aired . season five unfortunately has some dull episodes too , many of which occur in the second half of the season , so the best stuff is within the first four discs . it does n't really create much drive to push for a quick follow up with season six , but no doubt because six is as good as five was , then we are there for it . as a note : `` redemption part ii '' - this episode received as 12 age rating in the uk , because it contains klingon ritual head butting . `violations ' also has sexually violent content ( psychic rape ) . parents may want to be cautious and view those two episodes before showing it to children . if you are going to move onto season six then you will probably want to know that during season six the crew make contact with deep space nine . so if you get deep space nice : season one you can sync up the star dates and watch both franchises in chronological order . if you are in for six you may also be in for season one of ds9 ! season 6 season 6 is generally considered the pinnacle of the series for the wind down to the season 7 conclusion and of course the wake of popularity that star trek , deep space nine : season 1 whipped up while season 6 was running . 1993 was tv sci-fi heaven with fans getting a double dose of st for the year . this means for the folks who have been watching tos and tng , now is the time to do a special chronological order of star dates alternating between tng season 6 and ds9 season 1 . you can find the order if you search the new for it . tng has really good stories while ds9 gets the effects . we are no longer happy to see a new interactive flat panel as the driving force of a story . season 6 answers with substance to characters and stories with some surprises ( picard acting like a russian is hysterical . would you sacrifice his authority role for that quality humour from him from time to time ? maybe yes ! ) . the conclusion of `` time 's arrow '' is not the best cliff-hanger but sufficient . most of the main characters from season two are here , captain jean-luc picard , commander william t. riker , lieutenant commander geordi la forge , lieutenant commander worf , commander deanna troi , lieutenant commander data and dr. beverly crusher . ensign wesley crusher ( who departed from season four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining seasons ) returns for some episodes but is mainly replaced by the new ensign ro laren , a bajoran . colm meaney is here again as miles edward o'brien but will be transferred to ds9 ( his absence is not mentioned ) . whoopi goldberg 's guinan is back along with alexander rozhenko . keiko o'brien , ( miles o'brien 's wife ) will also leave for ds9 . lieutenant reginald barclay , engineer is back after being absent from season 5 . season 6 of tng is mostly about transporter psychosis , empaths , scotty ! , alien abductions , q , age regression , android dreams , artificial life , cardassians , prof. moriarty , love , romulan defection , destiny , klingon birthrights , thieves , command ethics , origins of life , insanity , murder , faith , doubles , time travel and the borg . like season 5 most the episodes in season 6 have above average sci-fi stories , combing planetary exploration and the life of the crew . memorable episodes include , a fistful of datas , the quality of life , ship in a bottle , face of the enemy , birthright and lessons . there are three very good episodes which really make the season worth . tapestry sees picard given the opportunity to relive his youth without the night he fought with a gang who stabbed him through the heart . suspicion is a great whodunit episode ( of which there are a few ) with one of the coolest star trek aliens ever ( should have made him a main character ) . descent part i is a very nice slight of hand trick . you will keep thinking hugh right up until the last second . season 7 star trek : season 7 is of course winding down to a conclusion , making way for some star trek films , but in reality it is deep space nine : season 2 ( ds9 : season 1 starts in star date chronological order with tng : season 6 ) that is the new trek . fans of star trek got their twofold measure of these series through 1993 and 1994 making it an exceptional sf tv era . the conclusion of `` descent , part ii '' has the finale of lore . most of the main characters from season two are here , captain jean-luc picard , commander william t. riker , lieutenant commander geordi la forge , lieutenant commander worf , commander deanna troi , lieutenant commander data and dr. beverly crusher . ensign wesley crusher ( who departed from season four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining seasons ) returns for one episode . while ensign ro laren , a bajoran , was supposed to replace him , she only appears in one episode in season 7 , although the episode is a major one focused on her . colm meaney shows up again as miles edward o'brien for the last episode . whoopi goldberg 's guinan is gone without explanation ( see the movie `` star trek : nemesis '' on her ) . alexander rozhenko is back . keiko o'brien , ( miles o'brien 's wife ) is not here either ( after leaving for ds9 ) . lieutenant reginald barclay , engineer , is back again . season 6 of tng is mostly about lore , emotional studies , interfaces , mercenaries , nightmares , psychic trauma , beverly and picard , warp travel environmental damage , data 's mother , alternate realities , the pegasus , worf 's human brother , incubus , top secret missions , radiation sickness , deities , troi and worf , reverse evolution , wesley and the traveller , klingon right of ascension , picard 's son , abiogenesis , ro laren and time travel . while there are some hit and miss episodes and a really terrible one ( `` masks '' for example is one of the worst of the entire franchise ) most are well above average and some are incredible . memorable episodes include , gambit , forces of nature , inheritance , lower decks , thine own self , journey 's end and bloodlines . the pegasus is probably the best episode of the season , but the finale `` all good things ... '' is really where it is at with some good aging effects , a possible future with an older looking cast and an futuristic enterprise to die for . the series ends very warmly and with a nicer note about the possibilities of looking within instead of charting stars and galaxies for a newer greater trek . in short there is nothing like st : tng . it evolved tv serials into mega media and ran for a full span of 7 years . it set a new benchmark and placed the bar as high as the stars . all we can say about this awe-inspiring series can be summed up in one word ... ... amen .
dvd	bob clark 's 1974 chiller classic , which went on to inspire many elements of `` halloween '' and `` when a stranger calls '' , is definitely one of the better , if not best , horror films out there . period . not high on blood , but very high on suspense , dread , atmosphere , and out-of-the-dark surprises . a sorority house ( to include the lovely olivia hussey , the vulgar alcoholic margot kidder , and sctv vet andrea martin ) falls victim to vicious , violent , and altogether menacing phone calls during the christmas holidays . soon , students on campus begin turning up missing . though some events do go unexplained ( which could be positive , considering the mystery involved ) and the film tends to go borderline predictable in some sorts , this is undeniably one of the creepiest horror films , with the most tense , moody photography ever captured on film . keir dullea and margot kidder turn in quite effective performances . highly recommended
dvd	2 fast 2 furious is one of those sequels that comes around every so often that does n't require you to have seen the original . i saw this movie for the first time not too long after it came out , and having never seen the original , i thought i would be lost and would n't enjoy myself as much as other people , but on the contrary - i left the experience much happier than when i came in . this film is full of quick one-liners that deserve a laugh . the special effects and the car races will leave your mouth gaping open . i have heard and read that people did n't appreciate this film as much because it seemed to focus more on a plot than the first film did rather than focus more on the races , but overall , i think the balance works well . even thinking of the plot that we are left with , i really ca n't see another time when a race would even be appropriate . and as for people saying that this film is worse than the original , i would have to disagree ... why ? frankly , i have always been a firm believer than vin diesel is entirely overrated as an actor . ( i mean , c'mon - have you seen the pacifier ? ) he 's nothing more than a meat head who , while able to do pretty good fight scenes , should leave the dialogue to someone else . yes , this film is for the younger crowd , and there are numerous occasions when unbelievable events take place ( take the boat jumping as an example ) , but there is no saying that an older person would n't enjoy it as well ... the only thing that i will say is that you really should n't go into this film expecting an oscar worthy performance , or else you will be disappointed . if you sit back and take this as the fun romp that it is , however , you will thoroughly enjoy yourself
dvd	this movie has a good plot , great acting , and potrays a very convincing relationship between a hardened young man and a girl whose combonation of strength and purity touches his heart and redirects the course of his life . i did like that they seemed to really know and understand each other , but was dissapointed in the sexual inuendos , the profanity , the undermining of parental authority , and the lack of closure concerning landon 's journey to faith . it is evedent that this movie is directed to a less-than-mature-audience . i saw more bad in it than good , which is sad since it could have been such an outstanding movie
dvd	this is without a doubt , one of harrison fords greatest moments . an incredible film with some of the best visual effects i 've ever seen . very dramatic with a lot of suspense . a very well written plot and an all star cast make this a very enjoyable experience to view . a film you will want to see again and again . action , mystery , drama , thriller . there are a lot of goofs in this film if you are into looking for such , but they do n't in any way detract from the overal quality of this very well done suspense drama . i highly recommend it
dvd	do n't expect a comedy in the vein of trinity or they call me trinity . if you do , you are in for a fall . both of those were silly but redeemed themselves by being entertaining . this one has no such pretensions . it is merely boring . the story concerns a corrupt mining company out to cheat the local town 's folk out of their claims . they do this through intimidation and violence . when a couple of friends get hold of a claim , they put together a plan to secure that claim and those of the rest of the town from the bad guys . to do this , they enlist the aide of a traveling circus to serve as a distraction . they yell , they fight , they wrestle , they shoot and then they do it some more . its not very exciting cinema . this production is made worse by the dvd . i suspect that the original film was a rather low budget affair . the dvd , however , is of such low quality that who could really tell ? the edges are clipped off , the transfer is grainy and the effect is of someone holding a hidden handycam in a theater trying to bootleg it . it was not worth the effort . spaghetti westerns can be fun . this one , however , needs the pepto bismol right from the beginning to drive off the heartburn .
dvd	maybe i loved the original one too much , but this version of the story did not work for me . i especially was dissapointed in the music and the oompa loompas . stick with the first one . it was perfect
dvd	not what i expected when renting this movie . as others have said clarissa came off too pure and innocent . futhermore , i do n't understand why such a viriginal woman would run off to be with one of the most horrid men in the world ? everyone knows what lovelace has done..there are numerous accounts . yet she goes with him anyway ? blah . the acting was ok . the costumes were excellent ( i love period movies ) but the plot dragged and dragged and dragged . and as another put it , i was very glad when clarissa kicked the bucket . i read a lot of historical fiction , classic novels and love period movies , but there was no liking this one . it just couldnt be done
dvd	this was an easily understandable view of the complex structure of the universes held by modern physics . it is found facinating by the common man .
dvd	this dvd is amazing ! perfectly puts the blues on display through the high-points and the low points of the season . the best thing about this dvd , besides the flying , is the respect they show the crew . yeah , the pilots get the glory and do the high flying cool stuff , but , they are faaaar from the stars of the show ! the maintainers and support people behind the flying is where the stars hide . this dvd also shines the light on the pilots and what they do . they truly go through the mill , but , they do n't do a single thing with those blue jets if the crew does not do their job perfectly . this is finally a dvd that shines the light on the pilots , but , makes it clear that nothing happens without the crew in support of the pilots . great job ! ! ! unlike the retired one who reviewed also ( great review by the way ! ! ! ! ) , i would not like to be a pilot after seeing this ! i would rather get faaar more reward working in my support role and knowing that the pilot gets his glory only because my ability to do the work allows it
dvd	great movie and the movie a family can set and enjoy and not worry about the next word or scene may hold
dvd	the scene where eric idle whines `` oh , you 're no fun anymore ! '' is a deceptive one . if anything , these guys are even more fun than before . the second half of monty python 's flying circus 's first season is even more polished and mad than the first , continuing the tradition of short skits focused on complete insanity . in these episodes , we have : a serial-killer barber ; lecherous art critics ; an unfortunate man who tries to eat a cathedral , tunnel to java and jump the english channel ; ken shabby , every girl 's dad 's nightmare ; thuggish old ladies ; bloodthirsty librarians who want to hire a gorilla ; camel-spotting ; and prime ministers falling through the earth 's crust . the longest and most bizarre skit is one where people mysteriously start turning into scotsmen and streaming north of the border . soon `` scotland will be choked with scotsmen , '' and england is pretty much abandoned . the culprits : tennis-playing , human-devouring blancmanges from the galaxy of andromeda . and , of course , the stuff that has become comedy legend : the scene where john cleese tries to return a dead parrot to a pet store ( `` it 's a stiff ! bereft of life , it rests in peace ! `` ) , and the lumberjack song ( `` i cut down trees . i skip and jump/i like to press wild flowers/i put on women 's clothing/and hang around in bars ... '' ) . of course , no mere description can do justice to the comic brilliance of these dozens of skits . these five brits ( and one american , who did the little cartoons ) created some of the most unabashed , naughty , nasty , and just plain weird comedy ever , which still influences everything from saturday night live to author jasper fforde . and all of this by men who often dress up as the world 's most unattractive girls , with only a tiny budget and minimal cast . the 70s production values are omnipresent , and they are decidedly unpolitically correct . but in a weird way , these only make it even funnier than it would have been otherwise -- the writing and acting are pure , raw , unrefined comedy . probably the most memorable actors here are cleese and idle . cleese does his psychotic shrieks better than anyone , as well as having that rubbery lanky body and howling monkey voice . and eric idle does a good job as everyone from a housewife to a wannabe mountain climber , while michael palin does a brilliant job as people who are timid or insane . by this point , the monty python guys had polished up their skits and reached a steady plateau of comic brilliance . in other words , it 's funny and should be watched
dvd	cast : denzel washington , john goodman , donald sutherland , embeth davidtz , james gandolfini , elias koteas , gabriel casseus , michael j. pagan . running time : 123 minutes rated r for violence and language . `` fallen '' starts with convicted serial killer edgar reese ( elias koteas ) being executed in the gas chamber as the man who brought him to justice detective jon hobbes ( denzel washington ) looks on . hobbes thinks that this is the end but soon has to rethink as he receives a phone call which tells him to check a house out where he finds a dead man named muscovich ( glen witko ) in a bathtub having been poisoned , the same way reese used to kill his victims . at first hobbes fears a copy cat killer but during the course of his investigation the name robert milano comes up , a decorated cop who apparently committed suicide . hobbes speaks with his daughter gretta ( embeth davidtz ) who at first is reluctant to speak with him . things become even stranger when the man who killed muscovich , charles ( robert joy ) is found dead in exactly the same way having been poisoned again . eventually gretta tells hobbes the truth , he is in fact dealing with an ancient demon called azazel who has the power to jump form body to body at will by mere psychical touch . the demon azazel seems to be taunting hobbes , ruining his life career , setting him up for murder getting to his friends family . hobbes must find a way to destroy the ancient demon before it destroys him everyone he cares about . charismatic leading man denzel washington is suitably cast as the protagonist and proves to have range , while john goodman is okay but greatly underused while the same applies to james gandalfini who plays almost the exact same character . donald sutherland does n't prove to have any range , doing the usual gruff routine that he does in nearly all of his movies . embeth davidtz is a talented and totally under-rated actress . she delivers a good performance and shows great potential for the future . the directing and camera work in this movie was superb . it was done in such a way where you can see azazel 's spirit go from person to person simply by following the camera up and down the crowd and watching the subtle touches one makes in a normal walk about town . although this film does require your full attention , it does not go unrewarded and you are not left at the end scratching your head wondering what had happened for the past two hours . `` fallen '' is an intelligently written , supremely efficiently executed , and one of the most unheralded , unnoticed thrillers of the late part of the decade . one of the better of its kind
dvd	gene hackman is jedidiah tucker ward , an aging yet tireless litigant for the public good , enemy of evil corporate type and the bane of overpaid attorneys everywhere . on the other side of this gap of good and evil is maggie ward , jed 's headstrong daughter . between them is a products liability lawsuit involving car lights that kill people . the premise suggests the ending - jed will win the day , but not before his daughter has been transformed into a noble attorney . jed will fight the good fight ( which will require supreme grandstanding ) while maggie learns just how amoral her side really is . what robs this courtroom thriller is what 's missing in virtually every courtroom thriller - a case that could go either way , an actual case in controversy . maybe because of the amount of preemptive litigation required just to produce a major motion picture , hollywood is simply too beholden to lawyers to make a truly biting film about them . instead of a compelling case , we have one that 's ready for our verdict as soon as we 've seen the suits worn by either side or their offices . the case in `` class action '' is one you can typify as `` david goliath '' , which is to say that the end has been fated to be won by the little guy by a higher power . there 's no way that we 're going to see a case won ( even by dishonest means ) by donald moffat 's hired band of harvard-trained professional liars , and there 's no way anybody in the audience is going to buy their arguments . maggie 's bosses are so transparently bad , that not only do they screw up , but even their explanations are patently evil even so , the film stacks the deck against them by cynically attributing to them as evil what are basic facts of life for lawsuits of this kind - namely that products liability plaintiffs will make overbroad requests for discovery , and defendants respond in kind by deluging the other side with documents responsive to the request but otherwise valueless . for a thriller about high-paid lawyers , `` class action '' has all the legal acumen of high-school mock-trial , with fewer suprises
dvd	cool band . worst videos ever . ever . makes me like them less . fearless freaks is good . this is garbage ...
dvd	this dvd is very cheesy and i am sorry i bought it .
dvd	this movie has more magic than a wand . this movie is a story about having faith in your beliefs . young jessica is so sure that this reindeer is prancer she is willing to go to extremes to help save her friend . sam elliot plays a tough dad who wants to have faith in his only daughter but is scared of losing her and his farm . this a wonderful classic for the young and old .
dvd	this dvd contains all of the original ben stiller show episodes , plus an extra un-aired episode . the show was not only far ahead of its time , but also timeless as is evidenced by stiller 's subsequent successful movie roles that drew from many of the characters from the tv series . for anyone who was a fan of the tv series or stiller 's movies , this dvd is a must
dvd	this was the first dvd i purchased after i bought my dvd player ( i know , it took me a while to get one ) . i had never seen the movie before , but amazon [ .com ] reccomended it so i took the chance . it had the perfect amount of predictability and comedie and romance . it 's the same story line that gets used a million times and never grows old . boy and girl are best friends . girl likes boy , but boy likes a different girl . boy asks for help from girl to get the other girl . boy realizes he 's in love with friend girl just in time to stop her from leaving
dvd	the story of nasa 's sucessfull failure ! ! ! this movie is base on jim lovell 's book lost moon , the title coming from the fact that every other astronuat that went to the moon the first time would walk on it the second . lovell is the only man to circe it both times he went there ! what makes this film so realistic is that dave scott ( 7th man out of 12 to walk on the moon ) was technicial advisor on the film . i 've known the story of the flight very well for years before the film was released , and watching the film i 'd say to myself that this is about the time that xxx happened and sure enough a few minutes later it sure did ! look quick at the very end of the movie for the real jim lovell , he 's the navy captian with gray hair shaking t. hanks hand ! see the imax version last . several scenes have been edited out
dvd	`` lagaan '' is a masterpiece . the setting , the music , the full range of singing , the craving for love , - all provide stimulating background for the depth of a plot which portrays a strong young man , with failth in himself , and his refusal to be ground under by external forces beyond his control . you , the reader , must step up to the wicket , sooner than you may realize , and defend the slim sticks of your belief in defense of the innate dignity of mankind .
dvd	i collect 1950s era sci-fi and i have been replacing my vhs versions with dvds . unfortunately , i need to keep my vhs version for this movie because the print that image entertainment made this from was in such poor shape . the vhs version by uav entertainment ( the wade williams collection ) is much better . hopefully , uav will come out with a dvd version soon
dvd	jewish soles trying to avoid the devil 's brigade ( hitler 's killing machine ) ... . sad , but oh so funny and cute in sections that alas , maybe only the jewish people would truly understand . i found it all of these things but with love , warmth to the end
dvd	this movie would get 5 stars if it were not carressing with one hand - portraying the gospel of john beautifully through the movie - and slapping yahushua/jesus and serious scholars in the face with the other hand . the so-called `` scholarly '' comments , for example about how the gospel was written 200 years after the events , are by and large intellectually dishonest and quite simply inaccurate . even the lowliest of bible scholars , if honest , will realize this . it is very sad to see people making a buck off the bible , while trying to tear it down at the same time . the worst examples of scripture put downs are in the 3rd dvd . i gave the movie to a relative without that add on
dvd	this was a great movie for me because my daughter did this dance routine in a school production 15 years ago and we both wanted to see the movie over and over again
dvd	wow , this was awful ! the best thing about this dvd is that it does n't last long . my boyfriend and i sat down to watch this together ( in the mood to begin with ) and both of us were completely turned off by it . the woman is not even naked , and wears a nightie throughout the dvd . she also is extremely hairy ( a matter of personal taste i know , but this was very extreme ) . the tone of it was decidedly unsexy , more of a strictly how-to than a way to excite the watcher ( s ) . it seemed to me to be very low-budget and unimaginative . spend your money on something else if you 're looking for sexual excitement..
dvd	i watched 7 out of 8 episodes in two days . it may be educational for people who did n't know much about it , but if you are somewhat familiar with the topics , this documentary film did n't offer much more
dvd	awful ... truly awful . joanne sellar and daniel lupi ( producers of boogie nights and hard eight ) should be ashamed of themselves and so should the weinsteins for producing this piece of crap
dvd	with the new year just more than six hours away , i must tell you that no matter a full moon , half moon , quarter moon , or no moon at all , please avoid the flick `` darkwolf '' for many moons to come . what a joke . what a silly , stupid , insult to one 's intelligence . the script could have been written by my dog stan ... and even then , i give him the benefit of the doubt to come up with something much more canine . let 's put it this way . have you ever seen a film that contained people that irritated you so much , you simply did n't give a ^^ % * if they got blown away ? i was hoping the entire cast got mulched by mr. wolf less that 30 minutes into this loser . go `` darkwolf '' . take a few chucks out of this cast , its director , producer , writer and editors as quickly as possible ... and do n't wait until the next full moon . `` darkwolf '' is an insult to motion pictures . more so , it is an insult to such credible werewolf classics as `` the wolf man '' , `` wolfen '' and `` the howling '' , not to mention the tongue-in-cheek horror classic `` an american werewolf in london '' . need i say more ? `` darkwolf '' has no bite . it 's claws and fangs have been chiselled to oblivion . the box claims this flick to be `` half man . half wolf . pure evil . '' in reality it is half/whole stupid . half/whole worthless . ... and ... pure ^ % * ! get my drift ? at midnight ... as we turn another page and the new year unfolds ... i promise you you will enjoy reruns of every episode of `` mary hartman , mary hartman '' , much more than `` darkwolf '' . i 'm off to watch yet another new year 's flick before dawn . i need to make amends to lon chaney , jr. before midnight . bottom line , it was a film you did n't really care `` where '' the `` wolf '' came from , or where the werewolf was going . pitiful ... embarrassing ... '' i 've seen the bad moon rising '' but this one makes me wish it would set !
dvd	pretty good ! my brother is a huge elmo fan , and he loves the elmos world dvd`s ! this is his fourth favorete one ! he watches it almost every two days
dvd	while visiting some family in utah a few years ago we decided to rent a few movies to pass the unforgivably hot mid-summer weather . we ended up renting `` analyze that '' and boy , what a mistake that was ! we were expecting at least a mildly funny sequel to 1999 's `` analyze this . '' the potential was there , it 's not as if writers ( of course it 's never a good sign to see numerous writers ) peter tolan , peter steinfeld , and harold ramis did n't have decent material to work with ; robert deniro , billy crystal , lisa kudrow , and a funny and entertaining plotline regarding mobsters and therapy . however , this being hollywood and all , another sequel was botched . it 's because of movies like these that sequels have such a bad reputation . despite a few genuine laughs in the first twenty minutes or so regarding deniro and some `` fish out of water '' situations , the movie seemed to go downhill soon after . the jokes became few and between as the film laboriously plowed its way through an over-the-top heist setup and execution that felt about as inspired as `` crossroads . '' now either they ran out of jokes , they did n't have enough time to invest in an actual story , or the material itself has been played out in so many different ways already ( `` the sopranos '' , `` the whole 9 yards '' , `` mickey blue eyes '' , etc . etc . ) , that there was simply nothing left to write about
dvd	the book from alex haley when i read it some 10 years ago changed my life and views of people with color , and everyone should read it , yes even conservatives , manditory . however , this movie something just wasnt good . to long ? the over all acting ? spike , you make some great movies , summer of sam is one of your best , do the right thing . spike has a gift for cinematography , however spike lee interview on espn ? the interview said , interviewer : `` kanye west said that bush does n't care about black people . would you agree with that ? lee : `` yes , i agree with that , but i 'll go one step further and say that bush does n't care about people who do n't have any money ( whether they 're black or white . ) i guaranteed you that if this same disaster happened on long island or let 's say the hamptons , you would have had an entirley different response from fema and his administration . '' but you should have seen how he said it , it was as if he was staring right into the camera with this smirk on his face . the dude is bold man , i 'll give him that and i applaude him . spike said either black , white , mexican , or asian . but what he did n't say was italians ! ! that dude has been getting flack forever for his dis'n of italians in his movies , they call him a racist all the time . here was his chance to say something , and he blew it . just did n't happen to say italians ? no so he is a racist too . and so are the africans in africa , they never have liked white people either , so what about that spike ? try going over their and applying for a job ! and while i am at , the african americans in even baton rouge do n't want the blacks from n.o . coming up their ! how come spike never said anything about that ? fkn whiners , so many the world over ! give them a mic and let them talk and will put it on tv and let the world see it for the fools they are . and ignoramus white liberals eat it up as its gospel and he is telling da truth
dvd	i live in colorado , one of the states that receives emergency funding because the illegal alien situation has gotten so out of hand . this movie is about a town called farmingville and the disruptions in their lives as they ( literally ) wake up to find mass groups of illegals outside of their neighborhoods . some live 20 to a house and have cars coming and going every day- ( imagine how that would bring down the resale value on a home ? ) the aliens surround the streets to hustle for work right out in the open . the video documents the two sides ( the ones who support , and oppose ) the situation . the side that opposes the intrusion into their lives painfully reveals their exasperation at their own city 's inability to instill order and law . as women who go to the neighborhood 7/11 are whistled at , they become nervous ( as a women offered in the video-unfortunetly it was not shown ) . the thick misogyny in the mexican aliens was especially disturbing ( example : a women who was with a special interest gruop to offer services to the illegal men was unsure whether they would listen to her , as in the mexican culture ) . some create groups in support , others create and claw for order . eventually a town meeting is called in which one of the women who runs the opposing group is called a rascist by her own politicians as he is flanked by two illegal aliens who nod in agreement . it is especially poignant to watch as this everday american women brings the situation to her counsil members . they call her a rascist , and many of the illegal aliens surround this politician in support.it was disturbing to see a foreign lawbreaker have more influence over our politicians than one law-abiding women and her attempts at trying to instill order in her own town . i do n't believe it portrayed the opposing townspeoples side very fairly . they had every right to be exasperated-our we not in a terror war ? since when does mexicos problems come before our own ? maybe because it was made by carlos sandaval it was more unobjective . i felt the film more unfairly depicted the opposing ( against illegal immigrants ) as 'mean ' rather than literally mindblown and aggravated their laws were n't being enforced ! when does the nations people not have a voice in their own country ?
dvd	do n't buy the directors cut . badder santa is absolutely hysterical . for some strange reason the director decided to make a `` director 's cut '' that is a neutered version of `` badder santa '' . i bought it yesterday when it came out and the internal dialogue from billy bob in the first scene was missing . the celebration in the bar after the first mall `` heist '' , where billy bob proclaims he 's giving up drinking , was missing . the next scene where billy bob was stealing drinks from the bar on the beach and fights with the bartender was missing . that was enough for me . i immediately shut it off and best buy agreed to let me swap it for `` badder santa '' due to the false impression of a `` longer and fuller '' cut than it 's predecessor , as is the industry standard . i was duped . please buy `` badder santa '' instead . this is a watered down/walmart version of a classic , not an extended cut
dvd	i am writing neither to critique the movie nor to eplore the quality of the video or audio . i would simply like to warn potential buyers of the manufacturer defects that i have enconter with two copies of this dvd . the first copy was scratched so severly it looked like a fat guy attempted to use it to ski down slopes of rough pavement . so amazon promptly shipped out another . the second copy did n't have a scratch but the movie hung up in the exact same place as the first . annoying ! i am currently waiting on another copy , but if it 's bad i 'm giving up . *important* consumers , take my review very seriously because i suspect these other reviewers have no experience with the dvd , they 're just fans of the film . and what an awesome film it is
dvd	with season 4 the series starts to slide a little . i do n't think the show is weaker , it 's just that how long can you watch a story before it starts to seem like you been there done that already ? look , i love the godfather one and two , but three is just not as good . the total time it takes to watch the first two godfather films is a little over 5 hours ! that wo n't even get you through season one of the sopranos . i hope i speak for everyone out there when i say that as good as the sopranos is , it will never come closed to the godfather movies . so i guess it is just starting to get old . i will certainly be watching the finale episodes , i just hope it is n't too big a let down . for those who are interested the dvd set has great transfers , but few interesting extras
dvd	let me accept the fact that lotr is my most beloved film and i already own the extended editions of the films in one set ! i 'm really not surprised to see new line coming up with another edition of the trilogy . with films like these they will squeeze the collectors as much as they can ! ! still , inspite of this new set containing both the theatrical versions and the extended cuts of the films and also the much hyped costa botes documentaries , my advise to anyone buying lotr for the first time is- do not buy this set ! spend a little more and you get all the movies in full 6.1 dts ex glory , alongwith hours of endless in-depth bonus features which probably you 'll spend rest of your life watching ! ! please be aware , these new editions do not contain dts tracks , no commentary tracks by the director , weta workshop or the cast . all you get is both versions crammed into one single disc and just one documentary as a bonus on the second disc ... and nothing else . it would have been a better idea had new line released the documentaries separately without forcing the consumer to buy the films again ... .and even this is not the end , once the hd format gains a little more acceptance , they 'll have another excuse to come up with a new version of the trilogy ! beware , extended edition set is the ultimate lotr experience , in terms of films or bonus features . go get it ... its worth all the money spent !
dvd	why ? because it has good sound dts hd 5.1 master lossless audio the picture quality will not blow you away it just seams flat and washed out and this just isnt a good movie i like tim burton and mark wahlberg but this movie was done wright the first tim
dvd	francis ford coppola 's apocalypse now is a pure example of method filmmaking . it is the true craftmanship of an essential filmmaker . the art direction , editing and sound effects are partially a small fragment which makes this film classical and memorable . what drives the integrity and semblance of the film is the storyline , acting and inner message . the inner message evidently enough is that war is hell , or in other words , hell is war . not many directors have the ambition or the true courage to establish such a well-defined piece of art . european filmmakers would n't have the slightest problem of directing the film or throw in their personal feelings about the war . what is most interesting is that an american filmmaker spoke his style and the style of the film 's collaborators through the continuance of the film . the plot is fairly simple and brief , adapted by joseph conrad 's heart of darkness . martin sheen plays the role of captain willard , a war-torn character who does not see any hope in life or humanity anymore . he has a mission and it is to capture a presumed colonel kurtz ( marlon brando ) who has fabricated an army of existensial soldiers on the outskirts of the cambodian jungle . throughout the film we encounter astonishing sequences . the most unforgettable is the dawn helicopter attacks . robert duvall 's character colonel kilgore is a steady and firm example of the basic american army brain : to search and destroy and then destroy some more if it includes yourself . the children walk about the playground , oblivious to any danger . the helicopters come into view from the dawning sea ; millions of sprinkle reflect from the water , we hear the helicopter 's engines roar from the horizon and soon enough we are stuck in a messy attack . throughout the sequence we hear wagner 's 'ride of the valkyries ' . it is method filmmaking . the starting sequence is as fascinating as the rest of the movie ; a beautiful scene of palm trees blowing in the ragged wind and seconds away from being inflamed with a carpet bombing . let 's not forget the scene where the soldiers of the boat in which sheen travels in , stop an innocent upcoming boat , suspecting them to be vietcongs and carrying artilleries . then they spark off a heavy scene of shooting in which all of the passengers of the boat are pulverised to pieces with their crops and food savaged in the atrocity . this film has its famous moment , some better to be kept quiet about until they come through the screen . it does n't require any intellectual understanding , although the film is intellectually remarkable . the american soldiers in the vietnam war jumped into the land of a fresh governmental country , aiming to protect themselves and in the end only received death and chaos for their troops and for the majority of the country they were fighting against . it was a war gone mad , like all other wars , without purpose or dignity . it was a pure act of humanity : to destroy and restore their own greedy needs . this is a film in which there is no saviour , where it is hardly possible to find hope in the gloomiest corners and where all surroundings are plagued with the infatuations of greed , anger , foolishness and egoism . as coppola once said about the film : 'this film is n't about vietnam . this film is vietnam ' . he was right to the date . during the current situations of the world , where they are trying to protect their own skin , the world should try to analyse this film as much as possible and wonder about what it is trying to represent . it is a film which does not ask for applause or damnation . it asks for realism . enjoy
dvd	this might be the perfect flick for a fourteen year-old who aspires to be a mass murderer . there is little to recommend it apart from the technical perfection of some of the cinematography and the staging of the scenes of mass destruction of people and property . even these scenes have none of the balletic grace of tarantino 's `` kill bill '' films , his salute to the genre , or `` reservoir dogs , '' which has a mystery at its core and some fine acting and dialogue that temper the violence . `` bullet ... '' is little more than two hours of broken glass , fire , blood squirts , amputation , beatings and explosions . this makes gladiator look like a sunday school picnic . the characters are totally flat , one-dimensional . there is virtually no plot aside from excuses generated to wreak havoc . the acting is weak , static , despite the fact that i do n't understand a word of cantonese . we are presented with a series of stereotypes ( the hooker with a heart of gold , the good friend , the crazy friend and the bad friend ) . unfortunately the american stereotype of the viet cong as madmen -- and saigon as hopelessly corrupt -- is reiterated here to the detriment of any understanding of viet nam during the american occupation . the worst thing is that -- because they are so shallow and undeveloped -- you do n't care what happens to the characters . so i 'll tell you and then you wo n't have to finish watching the film : they kill each other . my advice -- skip it
dvd	well , season 5 for me was a little bit of a dissappointment but still contain the character plot line ( or the theme as many will call it ) of southpark itself . since buying this i watched it alot in the first month or two then dropped off . my interest in southpark was revisited with season 6 ( also available on dvd ) however , if you like south park or love it this is for you of course without saying . however , if you just joining in you might want to get the package with the first 5 seasons all together , but this season was good
dvd	this movie was much better than `` vanilla sky . '' `` vanilla sky '' mostly copied `` open your eyes '' but was too obvious and less convincing . ( and tom cruise , though good in some roles , did n't fit this role well . ) `` open your eyes '' takes a little longer to draw you in , but once it has you there it takes you far beyond where `` vanilla sky '' does . also , the jungian dream aspect in `` vanilla sky '' is poorly done , whereas `` open your eyes '' represents the dream experience very well . i recommend watching both movies before you buy one . but if you 're going to buy , get `` open your eyes .
dvd	the special was filmed in 1970 and reflected the time period -- there 's a kind of flower power feel to it but it was well done . doris and perry como 's duet together was ok ( but perry seemed to not like doris flirting with him . ) doris day has always been under-rated as a singer . her voice is sheer perfection . it 's too bad that doris did n't do more specials or have a variety/comedy/musical show like carol burnett .
dvd	this dvd is the authorotizzle on the technizzle . fo schizzle
dvd	the story line was fair , but the t not so hot ... 2 star
dvd	this is my first review for amazon . i 've always felt that the reviews that i read were adequate to represent the movies and anime that i liked . not this time . i have an extensive collection of anime . everything from the really silly stuff , filled with fan service , to the very serious classics that so many fans rave about . i 'm not really into the mecha thing , though i do have a lot of it . it 's the animation first that drives my interest , then its the story and the character development are close seconds . appleseed has all that i 'm looking for in an anime , and in spades . great characters , a well crafted plot , and some of the best animation i have ever see . to say , as some reviewers have , that the movement in this version are unnatural , is more than unfair , it 's just not true . all action is extremely lifelike , and the action scenes are the best i 've ever seen . i actually found myself reversing the disc to rewatch some action repeatedly , something i never do . i 've owned this version of appleseed a few weeks now , and i have watched it at least five times , and am looking forward to another veiwing soon . i have relied on amazon reveiws to decide whether or not to buy anime in the past , so i hope that this reveiw is helpful . there is a lot of good anime worth investing in , and this one is near the top of my list
dvd	my first favorite television series was `` twelve o'clock high '' and i had at least two models of the `` memphis belle '' when i was kid , all of which simply reflects the fact that the b-17 flying fortress is my favorite airplane . when i was a kid my family was driving through california and there was a b-17 parked out on somebody 's front lawn on a ranch and for years i tried to figure out how to go back and see it . a couple of decades later one of the few b-17s still flying came to the zenith city and i finally got to go inside one ( this big bombers are a lot smaller than i ever thought ) . for all i know that particular b-17 ended up flying in the 1990 film `` memphis belle . '' when i had occasion to drive through the city of memphis , of course i made a point of visiting mud island where the `` memphis belle '' was on display ( she was moved to the air force museum in dayton , ohio this october ) . the `` memphis belle '' ( serial no . 41-24485 ) was one of 12,750 b-17 flying fortresses built by the boeing aircraft company , but it was the most famous because it was the first heavy bomber to complete 25 combat missions over hitler 's europe without losing a crew member . the idea of 25 missions and going home was established by the bomber command as an incentive for air crews because morale was desperately low after the first three months of american combat flights over europe during which eighty percent of the planes were shot down . the `` belle '' flew from november 7 , 1942 to may 17 , 1943 and its final flight is the fanciful subject of this film directed by michael caton-jones ( `` scandal '' ) from the script by monte merrick ( `` staying together '' ) . that simply means that besides the fact that the `` memphis belle '' was named for a lady friend ( margaret polk ) of the pilot and that the art on the nose depicting the same ( designed by the famous artist george petty ) there is nothing here that is historically accurate when it comes to that final mission , which was over lorient , france and not bremen , germany ( the `` belle '' flew there on its 21st mission ) . the names of the crew are all changed and i think the same applies to the plane 's mascot , a scotty dog named `` stuka . '' so if you want something closer to the `` true '' story of the pilot robert morgan and the `` memphis belle '' you want to check out william wyler 's 1944 documentary `` the memphis belle : a story of a flying fortress . '' what you have here instead is a hollywood movie that celebrates the men who flew these bombers in world war ii by incorporating a wide variety of clichés from war movies involving airplanes . then there is the whole idea that americans from all walks of life who have little in common besides a desire to get home alive band together to fight the nazis . so it is we have the young and recognizable faces of matthew modine as the business like pilot , eric stoltz as the poetic radio operator , tate donovan as the co-pilot who wants to actually do something before he goes home , d.b . sweeney as the navigator who is convinced his number is up , billy zane as the bombardier who left medical school to fight , sean austin as the runt who is stuck in the ball turret , reed edward diamond as the flight engineer , courtney gains and neil giuntoli as the bickering waist gunners , and harry connick as tail gunner and sometime crooner . back at the base david strathairn plays the commanding officer nervous about his boys getting back alive and john lithgow is the public relations officer the army has sent to celebrate the final mission of the `` belle . '' of course , it is hard to create tension given that most viewers know the `` memphis belle '' is remembered for completing that final mission , so any tension that is created tends to be somewhat artificial although there are some nice moments during the bomb run ( the film might play better if it simply inspired by the `` belle '' and they changed the name of the aircraft as well ) . but even if the `` belle '' survives there are other several b-17 crews on the mission who will not . still , the idea that doing your duty could not just be dangerous but be outright suicidal is communicated , allowing modine 's character to explain the job to his nervous crew and underscore that americans do not believe in collateral damage . but what will probably stand out in this film is the grim lesson that donovan 's character learns when he tries to be a hero by doing somebody else 's job .
dvd	this is a great collection . i can remember every saturday morning glued in front of the tv waiting for this show to come on . it 's truly a great dvd that not only i can enjoy , but my son is hooked on it now too
dvd	this movie is truly wonderfully done . i appreciate the lightheartedness of the characters , and the deep resonances of director zhang yimou 's commentary on academics in modern rural china . the language is particularly good for students learning mandarin chinese , as it shows an excellent example of the differences between spoken chinese in the countryside and in the cities . there are english subtitles for beginners as well . i highly recommend it .
dvd	david lean 's `` the bridge on the river kwai '' like jean renoir 's `` grand illusion '' is an anti-heroic war film , set in a prisoner of war camp environment ... but there , the point of resemblance came to an end ... `` the bridge on the river kwai '' is an adventure film in which the nature of world war ii is explored ... and if in `` grand illusion '' the characters were described by a great artist who treasures their common humanity , in `` the bridge on the river kwai '' they are forced to carry out their destinies by an officer who can not bear to see his bridge blown up ... escape is almost impossible from the japanese camp located near the kwai river in burma ... the prisoners are badly treated by cruel guards ... the camp commander is a rigid psychopath ... conditions are hard to bear ... psychological state of the war british prisoners in constant alteration ... into the presumptuous situation comes colonel nicholson ( alec guinness in a fascinating performance ) , a strict , serene , dedicated british officer , deeply concerned for the welfare of his men ... nicholson is under severe pressure from the stubborn japanese colonel saito ( sessue hayakawa ) for insisting on his attachment to the geneva convention and refusing to allow his officers to be used on the construction of the strategic bridge ... nichilson survives the oppressive punishment imposed on him , but his obsession has risen to near-madness ... he agrees to help the japanese build their bridge , and in his determination to find victory in defeat , he ignores that the bridge , which he insists must be a 'proper bridge , ' will serve the japanese objectives against the british troops ... in addition to the powerful rules of a prison camp picture , captors against captives and an interesting moral respect to a military code , a third element , in the story , is introduced : a small commando team led by major warden ( jack hawkins ) and an american sailor ( william holden ) whose mission is to destroy the strategic bridge.. the film leads swiftly to a suspenseful climax : a japanese train and a commando force directed to a same goal , the brige of the river kwai ... each character , in the motion picture , has a valid reason for what he is doing , and each elaborates a relationship to the bridge revealed to be obsession and insane ... `` the bridge on the river kwai '' hits with 'war ' in a compelling logic of events , the indulgence of self-destruction . with a great visual beauty and terrific whistling tune march , `` the bridge on the river kwai '' is a great dramatic entertainment of the wills of men ...
dvd	this is a teen movie with the endless teen theme of boy seeking to get the goodies from the girl . it is better than the average for this genre due to several factors . mostly , it is because is well done . the subject matter lends itself to course treatment but that is not what is presented here . instead , the situations are depicted with as much dignity as possible from hormone driven teenagers and is is presented with comedy . the time of the film is the 50s . society was more innocent back then but boys still had the same thing on their minds that they always have and always will . in this case , the school geek has a bad case for the school beauty queen . he is aided in his quest by the cool loner from out of town who has his own heart set on `` the nice girl '' . meanwhile , the unpopular girl has a bad case herself for the geek . the geek achieves his goal and learns that the decorative aspects of women sometimes cover up the less desirable traits . the loner finds that the nice girl really is a nice girl and that love is something special . the unpopular girl undergoes a hormone miracle and becomes a prize catch . everyone winds up happy except the town bully/rich boy . it is simplistic in its portrayal but no less appealing for that . kelly preston plays the beauty queen and she really is the stuff of dreams until the wrapper comes off . doug mckeon plays the geek who becomes a prize himself . catherine mary stewart is the nice girl that i wish had lived next door to me and jami gertz is the metamorphosed hormone miracle . the cast is rounded out by chris nash . each does a good job in the role . teen angst comes to the fore and a worthwhile story actually results . it was fun and bittersweet in the memories it conjured .
dvd	these 2 guys playing harry and lloyd were so disastrous . they did n't even know how to act corny when they 're supposed to . jim carrey might be crazy at times but i do n't think he 's this bad . the whole thing looked like monkeys flying around the screen . nevertheless , it has some funny moments like when jessica 's parents found all the poo sticking all over the toilet . the whole idea of a 'special class ' was just so stupid . nothing made sense . i did n't see a single point of the whole plot in the first place just to get a little extra cash . the first one was a lot better than this one . jim carrey and jeff daniels were a lot dumber and a lot funnier . these 2 were worse than dumb and were n't even funny at all . i guess 'dumb and dumberer ' would be better if it were still jim carrey and jeff daniels starring but nooo , it had to be these 2 who i do n't even know . please do n't watch it guys . it may be funny for some guys but it 's mostly corny like kindergarteners gone wild . watch the first one ! ! ! kirstie mabita
dvd	this is the worst transfer to dvd i 've ever seen ! ! ! i think the vhs copy looks and sounds better , do not waste your money ! !
dvd	a woman who lives in an apartment in nyc and ca n't cook and does n't have a baby must fool the owner of her magazine into thinking she really is the character she writes about . ( she writes a very popular domestic advice column . ) she succeeds , until a navy hero wins the opportunity to spend christmas with her in her house in connecticut , enjoying her homemaking skills and meeting her baby . problem is , she does n't have any of those things . she borrows the house ( from a man who wants to marry her ) , she borrows the cooking skills of a sweet grandfatherly chef who secretly cooks for her at the house , and she even borrows a baby . the unmaking beings when she tells the navy man her child is a boy , and when he volunteers to give it a bath he discovers it 's really a girl . then the mother of the baby takes it back , and the baby is replaced by a baby who looks nothing like the first one . then the woman is falling in love with the navy man ( and he with her ) while the man from whom she 's borrowed the house still believes she 's going to marry him , and keeps bringing a minister to the house for a quickie wedding . it 's a delightful movie . very funny , and rich in both plot and character development . unfortunately , what probably makes it not a classic by today 's standards , it is a bit plodding . it does not move at the same pace as , for example , the movie casablanca , with which it shares some of the same supporting actors
dvd	i was so excited when this dvd came out hoping to get the four pittsburgh steelers highlight films from the '70s . 98 % of all this material is already included in the super bowl collection sets put out last year on dvd . why wo n't nfl films step up and give us more ? ? ? this should be a steeler-specific box set , not some rehash of the entire season for all teams ... come on steve sabol ; give us what we want ! !
dvd	first of all , this is not the worst movie ever made , nor even the worst movie ever made that was given a budget and some name stars . the worst movie ever made was `` autumn in new york '' , but that is a different review . no , this not a great movie , but it is very interesting . and for once , thank god , it does n't end with everything tied up in a pretty hollywood bow where everthing works out for everyone . it has a gritty sort of realism that transcends the walk through performances of the stars of the movie . and the scenery works well for the overall feel of the movie , bleak . more interestingly for me and others of my generation who grew up with the brat pack , this marked the end of these actors forays into trying to do the teenager thing . for molly ringwald , she did n't do anything of note again until `` the stand '' six years later , and for andrew mccarthy , well it could be argued that he still has n't starred in anything of note again ( although he probably made some money from `` weekend at bernies '' i ii ) . anyway , probably better to rent than buy , i am only buying it to complete my 80 's collection .
dvd	if you want to see lena heady 's breasts exposed , this is the film to watch . but besides the numerous unnecessary topless scenes ( which are n't too bad ) this film is very intriguing ... the human spirit tries to break through walls of addiction , frustration and isolation ... now is n't that what a `` suspense '' drama should be about
dvd	these days i want laughter in my life and katt williams gives it to you in the pimp chronicles . i thought kat williams live was great , but this one was better ! his tell it like it is and living life approach is great . if you ca n't go to see him in a live performance this is the next best thing . be prepared to laugh so hard your sides ache . keep an open mind and go for the ride !
dvd	this movie was probably the best one next to lucario and the mystery of mew and jirachi wish maker . pokemon ranger centers around the legendary pokemon manaphy and of course ash and his friends . some new and amazing characters include buizel , jackie the ranger , mantyke , and chatot the annoying but funny pokemon . the villian is great , the ending is amazing , and the effects were the best yet
dvd	i was a bit disappointed in this tape . the workouts are too easy . i had mastered abs of steel i and was looking for abs of steel 2 . i could n't find it so i bought this one but its too easy . i found a used abs of steel 2 and i like it much better
dvd	loved this movie when it first came out and loved it just as much the this time around . two of my favorite actors depicting a story that love has no boundaries . very funny and moving - yes , i 'm a romantic ! it 's awesome !
dvd	i do n't want to spoil this movie for others and i wo n't . cache is french for hidden and alot was left hidden . why does the son suddenly do what he did ? why does he think his mother is doing what he thinks she 's doing ? i did n't care one bit about any of the charactors . this is a slow going movie with no conclusion . if you have a choice between watching this movie or watching paint dry , flip a coin . i watch international films often and usually fnd them more rewarding than most us made films . not this one .
dvd	i saw transamerica months ago and i still think about it . there are many reasons , most obviously felicity huffman 's portrayal of bree , a man determined to become a woman , trying to close the door on his past , just as it unexpectedly reopens to disclose an heretofore unknown and decidedly lost child . but transamerica also brings a funny , poignant , and at times visually beautiful road trip across the united states , in an old car that you wonder how it could make 50 miles , let alone 3000 . it brings unexpected and uncertain romance . it brings out humanity in all its characters ( save one minor one ) , including bree 's bitter mother . finally , it -- plot spoiler here -- concludes with tentative reconciliation , acceptance , and an uncertain but potentially hopeful future . transamerica is not loud , not big budget , not spectacular , but there are few movies near as good as it .
dvd	it takes an hbcu graduate to write about the hbcu experience , period . just look at `` a different world '' and how bad the first season was . debbie allen ( a howard grad , i believe ) stepped in and gave the show the authenticity it sorely needed . so it 's no surprise that spike lee , the morehouse man , would make a movie that sparked so much emotion on both sides of the coin . i 'm not saying that you had to attend an hbcu to understand `` school daze '' , but you had to have attended one to get the real `` flavor '' of what it was like . and you have to have an open mind . any hbcu alum saying that this film was n't realistic is flat-out lying . yes , it hit on some things that the old folks call `` dirty laundry '' ( such as hazing , color issues , those who think that getting an education makes you `` white '' , and so on ) , but those things are real at hbcus - yes , even today . ( major props to spike for having that one dark-skinned sista in the gamma rays . is n't that always the way ? ) and there are no `` good '' people or bad people ; spike leaves that decision up to you . julian had his good points ( his intelligence , leadership and pride in his town , school , etc ) and dap had his bad points ( his blatant bigotry and bullying ) , and both of them had legitimate points . one thing spike nailed right on was the confrontations that the students tended to have on a regular basis . no offense to whites or anyone who graduated from a pwc , but in my experience at a predominately white high school , i noticed that students there were a lot more subtle with their dislike ; they particpated in a more `` destroying from within '' kind of system , and grew wide-eyed and offended when confronted , even with solid proof . ( `` i would never spread rumors about you/sleep with your boyfriend/steal your term paper ! '' ) black students , on the other hand , will take anyone head-on , whether that person is the school president , captain of the football team , the richest kid on campus , crippled ... does n't matter . your `` status '' does n't count if you go to an hbcu . i had a friend who saw sd and said `` that is so unrealistic ! since when do college kids go fighting with each other all the time ? '' she graduated from the university of texas . enough said . i 'm so grateful for this film , and its realistic portrayal of black hbcu students for those who think that all young black people do is have babies and suck up welfare , and that people only go to hbcus because they ca n't get into a `` real '' college . i would n't trade my experience at florida a university for a degree at any pwc . rattlers
dvd	note that in my previous review , in which i commented on the dreadful dvd transfer , i was only referring to the `` that touch of mink '' dvd . the father goose dvd is not that bad
dvd	truth be told , i should probably give this film only four stars because it does take a while to really get going and i think some of the story elements could have been presented more effectively . when this thing gets going , though , the descent easily attains not-to-be-missed status , and on top of all the incredible special effects , oppressive atmosphere , and grievous bloodletting ( made with a pretty limited budget , by the way ) , one of the most important plot points of the story is actually brought home in an impressively subtle manner . are you kidding me ? blood , gore , a claustrophobic atmosphere like you would n't believe - and subtlety ? how could i not give the descent five stars ? so you 've got these young british women who like to get together once a year and engage in some sort of risky , extreme activity . white water rafting , for example . everyone has fun , but then a horrible automobile accident changes the life of one of the women , sarah ( shauna macdonald ) , forever . still recovering from her terrible loss , sarah joins her friend beth ( alex reid ) in america , where mutual friend juno ( natalie mendoza ) , an alpha female if there ever was one , has staked out a cave system just begging to be explored . joining in the fun are holly ( nora-jane noone ) , juno 's new gung-ho sidekick , and a couple of sisters who round out the spelunking sextet . the movie drags a good bit as we sit and watch the girls arrive at their destination in the appalachians ( apparently somewhere in the north carolina mountains - although the movie was filmed entirely in the uk ) , then do their bonding thing the night before the big adventure . once they descend into the cave system , though , things start getting more intense fairly quickly . their first real move down into the complex of cave structures turns into quite a tight and claustrophobic ordeal , especially for sarah who gets stuck and is barely pulled to safety before the tunnel collapses . that 's when juno , a woman with more than her fair share of secrets , admits that she has led the girls into a cave system that has never been explored before , supposedly to help reunite the group . well , it does just the opposite , but they just have to keep going . if there is a way out , they 're going to have to find it the hard way . things are already creepy enough at this point . the filmmakers did an incredible job with the sets , making the viewer feel as if he/she is trapped in a real cave system with the characters . just watching these girls pull their bodies through extremely tight , dark spaces was enough to get me feeling pretty darn claustrophobic . but the real fun was just about to begin . in the wake of one of the most realistic compound leg fracture scenes you 'll ever want to squirm through , sarah spots the presence of someone or something else down there with them . no one believes her - at first . when the `` crawlers '' attack , though , all hell breaks loose two miles under ground . these gollum-like creatures are some kind of blind , albino humanoids who hunt by sound , can scamper and climb like monkeys , move unbelievably quickly , and really tear into whatever flesh they can find . not only are they frighteningly impressive in and of themselves , the filmmakers present them in the most effective of cinematic light . and when the girls fight back , it 's cinematic magic as the filmmakers hold nothing back in the creepy , bloody , gruesome department . and even as characters are fighting for their lives , a personal bombshell or two also drops to ratchet up the frenetic drama level even higher . the ending is a little controversial because american theatrical audiences did n't get to see the true final scene of the film , for some pretty questionable reasons . a few seconds can and do make a pretty big difference . do n't worry , though , as the dvd has both endings available . the descent draws deeply from the well of man 's most instinctual fears , making it one of the most atmospheric , heart-pounding movies to come along in quite a while . the subtlety of the story in terms of the relationship between sarah and juno is almost as impressive as the cinematography and sound work - and it even leaves room for an alternate explanation of everything that happens here . the descent has everything you could ever ask for in a horror film - and plenty more on top of that . if you care the first thing about horror , you must see this atmospheric tour de force
dvd	the main character came across as gay to me too . this movie is in no way realistic . the other reviewer is right about everything . it 's a really cheap movie made by amateurs using plastic toy guns , the actors jerk the guns to make them look like they have a kick . the `` martial arts '' in the movie are weak and sloppy , there 's no way that crap would actually work in real life . i do n't even know why i bothered to watch the whole thing , i guess i just found the stupidity amusing . the cover makes it look like it would be a cool movie , unfortunately that 's the only thing they put much effort into . i rented it from block buster too , they need to burn it . this movie looks like some kind of a high school project or something , like they had to make a movie to pass drama class
dvd	i bought the dvd hoping to see one skit -- the funniest one my family had ever seen on snl . we had it recorded on vhs many many years ago and somehow lost it . but we would sit and laugh until we cried watching the skit where phil played the drill sargeant who came up with nicknames for his new recruits -- `` smiling laughing joking around man '' ... `` man who reminds me of my doggie '' ... `` hair head ! '' i thought for sure that the funniest skit in all of snl history would be on there , but no ... it was just a 20 second clip . i was so disappointed ! ! and it was quite surprising to see some of the skits they chose to show in their entirety ... they just were n't funny . on a positive note , there was a serious song and dance number at the very end of the dvd that was so sweet , it brought me to tears . and the bonus featuring phil 's audition was quite interesting . but overall , i do n't recommend it .
dvd	this comedy , like click has a funny side to it and then switches to a darker side half way through . the characters in this film can be hated at points , especially michael douglas ' and matt dillon 's but there is a lighter side ! owen wilson is very likeable as dupree , an unemployed party guy who is in need of love and a good paying job . the cast is fine and one of the strength 's in this film ! however , i think it gets too serious at points . this is supposed to be a comedy after all . i would n't buy it but it is certainly worth renting
dvd	this was an excellent sophomore season for a great series
dvd	our one year old loves this one , and so do i . the music is wonderful . the creative incorporation of vivaldi 's four seasons and monet 's masterpieces are entertaining and educational . the children , little puppets and sequences with toys and nature makes this interesting for our child . we watch this one most of all the baby einstein 's that we have .
dvd	i was so disappointed in this film . the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because of the heart and soul terrance howard put into his acting . i love terrance , he is an outstanding actor but seeing him playing a pimp was just embarrassing . he did an excellent job with the acting but i would have much rather seen him portraying marvin gaye . call me naive but is pimping still actually going on in memphis , tennessee in this day and time ? and did terrance howard give ludacris ' character a cassette tape to listen to ? not a cd , a tape . i probably would have flushed it down the toilet too . and the hook to that song , `` you know it 's hard out here for a pimp . '' ya think ? with prostitution being illegal in the state of tennessee and all . i found myself cringing and sliding down in my seat in the theatre when she began to sing because i was so embarrassed . do n't get me wrong , i love my black people but sometimes when we get a chance to make a major motion picture we just do n't quite bring it , do we ? `` the cookout '' `` how high ? '' `` girl 6 '' `` woo '' `` kingdom come '' now we can add `` hustle and flow '' to the list . i 'm glad terrance howard redeemed himself in `` crash . '' do yourself a favor and pass on this one .
dvd	as cute and talented as i think hugh jackman is , this production was a waste of time , space and money . everyone involved in this feature should be ashamed of themselves . the acting is bad , the script is horrendous and the cg people apparently think their stuff do n't stink ... which it does-badly . it 's not the worse movie i 've seen , but it 's surprisingly close . please do n't waste your time with this film
dvd	this very b grade horror film left alot to be desired . aside from one blasemophous scene where the demon priest sucks on a crusifix to suggest oral sex , and a young man who has ripped open his shirt to carees his pecks sucks his crusifix , there wasnt much to make this unrated . if your expecting to see frontal or rear nudity , forget it ! the nearest thing is teenage guys running around in tight calvin klein undies . however , if your someone who likes to use your imagination , this might be for you . one good thing about this flick is a pre charmed hottie drew fuller rubbing himself all over in his undies . if your a big drew fan like me , it might be worth buying , utherwise go buy a playgirl
dvd	`` domestic disturbance '' is a thriller about a divorced couple and their child . frank ( john travolta ) has to deal with a man marrying his ex-wife susan . the guy ( vince vaughn ) is well liked by the community , but there are hints of something being amiss with him . frank 's son claims he witnesses his mother 's new husband rick commit murder . the more frank investigates rick , the more suspicious he looks . the investigation spurs a game of cat and mouse . there is great interaction between travolta as a concerned parent and vaughn the cold heartless type . the tension between them breeds suspense . the would-be new father uses his craftiness to manipulate those around him . there are few things he would n't do to get his way . `` domestic disturbance '' is entertaining with its high-tension suspense and great action . i highly recommend it for those who enjoy a thriller that will keep you guessing to the last minutes .
dvd	predator is arnold s best movie from the 80s , followed by the t1 and conan the barbarian on the third place . there is an exclusive edition to be released in 2007 /sept 1/ in uk that will have a replica of predator s head in mask , something simmilar to the alien deluxe head box quadrilogy edition , it will cost about usd200 , - . check it out on amazon.co.u
dvd	me and a female friend went and watched this one in the theater . i ... was ... bored ... out ... of ... my ... skull . after about a half hour my friend , who tends to be more `` progressive '' than i , actually suggested we leave . it was the first time either of us have ever left while the movie was playing . ever ! perhaps i 'm biased . however i highly recommend that no one get this movie . the only reason i can think that anyone would give it a good rating is because of its political slant . i tend to lean to the right , but even i was entertained by v for vendetta , despite it being blatant liberal propaganda . if you are going to pontificate about how we conservatives are evil , at least make it interesting
dvd	this film had a powerful effect on me . 95 % of the people i know do n't read books . i met a millionaire not long ago , who boasted to me that he had never read a book in his life . lady di was reported never to have read anything -- - except perhaps fashion mags . my children hardly read , and their husbands and wives certainly do n't . my ex-wife never read anything . her father thought ulysses was a dirty book . i stopped watching television in 1980 , and i own 10,000 books -- - but not fahrenheit 451 , which i 'd read about 45 years ago . this was long enough for me not to compare the film with bradbury 's text , but the message came through the movie medium loud and clear , and with a very solid punch to the plexus . the manner in which it is written , played and directed , added to its impact . this world of sleep-walkers perfectly matched what is already all around us . the style was strange , but gradually you realise that this strangeness is actually what is now completely normal . people live and work like automated morons . they ca n't think for themselves , and their critical faculties are almost totally atrophied . they ca n't conduct a stimulating conversation of any kind : in fact , present them with an idea , or attempt to initiate a discussion , and they 'll often become angry . some of the several low end reviews on this site illustrate precisely what the film depicts . ludicrous suggestions : remake it with mad mel gibson . have infantile spielberg direct it . bulk it out with computerised sfx . these ghastly proposals precisely reflect the mentality of the sub-humans which the film targets , and many of them seem unable to understand their own language , let alone write it , or spell it . this is a memorable film , for those whose memories still function . unlike the captain of the firemen
dvd	this film has some good actors in it but the plot is pretty shaky and hard to follow at times . it is not comparable to other great westerns made during the sixties . eli wallach is good but confusing -- who and what is he after ? the color is good and it sounds like a sergo leone picure but it is n't . what a shame ! ! ! it could have been made better -- less comedy and more plot and of course -- action and suspense ! ! ! ! buy or rent on your own if you dare -- -- i would n't
dvd	this is one of the best movies starring children i have ever seen - ozu embraces their viewpoint - often litterally from their eye level . often in other ozu films like 'tokyo story ' , and 'early summer ' - we would see flashes of children from a strikingly noncondescending and , often times , humerous perspective . now in 'good morning ' we have an almost entire film devoted to childhood - and events that are important in the lives of these kids and their parents and family . like all ozu films it is gorgeously shot and in a bright colorful style full of wonderfull compositions . it is not as masterul as 'tokyo story ' of 'floating weeds ' - but it gives us a better understanding of ozu and how he saw the world - very charming film
dvd	this movie is good fun . the sound track is excellent . does anyone know how i can get a cd sound track of this movie ? send info to geraldkalisik @ hotmail.co
dvd	war exposed some violence simmering within one gulf war veteran . christian bale is electrifying as jim , a tough-minded ex-ranger whose brutal nature did n't subside after his return home to la . they say war changes a man . this might be evident here , but it feels more like the fighting only unleashed the demons inside of jim . along with his buddy mike ( freddy rodriguez ) , the two tear through the town , bingeing on drugs and alcohol . their is no deep plot here , just a couple of ruffians going around town looking for jobs . but it is a great character study , watching jim self-destruct . bale is great in this type of role , like he was in american psycho or the machinist . i liked this movie much more than training day , which this director previously wrote the screenplay for
dvd	the brood is the lightning in the bottle that director david cronenberg has never been able to duplicate . while all of his films definitely have his fingerprints all over them , the brood managed to rise to the top of all of his films . it is absolutely dripping in a sense of dispair and dread . there is a pervading coldness about it - such that you want to wrap up in something warm as you watch it - you want to watch it with the lights on because you 're very much afraid of what might be there if you turn off the lights . the film is a psychological thriller wrapped in a slasher flick . it warrants slasher status simply because of the sheer number of onscreen murders that take place . this is a very bloody film ! samantha eggar is nuts and in a weird clinic for people like her . she is being treated by a creepy oliver reed ( in one of his better performances ) . art hindle is her ex husband and he 's worried about how she is treating their young daughter . after a while that is the least of his worries , as these horribly disfigured and ( what the hell are they ? ) bizarre little children run around killing all the people that have really ticked off samantha eggar . i wo n't say more , because part of the horror in a cronenberg film is the pseudo-science that he get you to believe in . whereas cronenberg 's videodrome was weird , but not terribly good , the brood is one of the creepiest films i 've ever seen and a guilty pleasure ( can i really call it that ? ) that i choose to subject myself to every so often . really ! what are those things ?
dvd	i would reccomend this film to any robert johnson fan as well as to anyone just getting into the blues who wants to know where its really at . it includes some great interviews with johnny shines , robert jr lockwood and others who knew robert . its worth it just to hear lockwood play an unrecorded song of r.j. 's ! the parts where keb ' mo ' re-enacts segments from r.j. 's life are well done and effectively illustrate what life would have been like back then for a traveling bluesman . my only criticism would be that there are few extra dvd features , however , that does n't stop me watching this film again and again ! a very informative insight into the life of one of the greatest delta bluesmen
dvd	i found this movie to be almost unwatchable . if your idea of a good time is watching henry gibson trying to sing while the camera takes long pans over dull crowd scenes , then this movie is for you . the three minutes of excitement near the end barely has anything to do with anything that preceeded it . altman can pull off such greats as `` mash '' and `` godsford park '' and then stink up the joint with this . what 's up with that
dvd	timeless classic movie . 2 of the songs are frequently re-done by various artist
dvd	the perpetrators of a high-level corporate scandal ( masayuki mori , takashi shimura , ko nishimura ) are pursued by the illegitamate son ( toshiro mifune ) of a low-level functionary that they drove to suicide to protect their schemes . this film begins as a deeply satisfying revenge epic , but the masterful director akira kurosawa is not content to let it rest there . he draws out all the moral complexities of the situation , then hits us with an unexpected development at the end that gives an ironic twist to his title . the bad may not always go to prison for their crimes , but do they really `` sleep well ?
dvd	bad , bad , bad . bad acting , bad writing , bad directing . i was sort of neutral about dicaprio until i saw this steaming pile of bad acting . consequently , since seeing this , i have n't voluntarily watched another dicaprio performance . it was a huge mistake by the director ( or the screen writer ) to not set this in the era in which jim carroll grew up . or if it was meant to be , it failed astoundingly with glaring anachronisms
dvd	my boys have grown up with dave hood playing all sort of characters like busdriver dave , pilot dave and fireman dave . i was excited to get this new dvd as my youngest is crazy for tractors and dump trucks . unfortunately , there 's a new dave ( kind of like the change that took place in blues clues ) and it 's just not the same . the new dave is not bad perse , but after years of dave hood 's cheesy grin , i ca n't say that we watch this one much if at all
dvd	the opening strip scene is reminiscent of barbarella - too bad those are n't basinger 's legs though . nerdy scientist falls for galactic beauty as presented by kim basinger . i have never understood ackroyd 's characters . and keeping in form , he is once again as unfunny as mud . basinger tries so hard - too hard - to rescue this film , but that 's no small task considering the ineptness of this way silly film . ok so she munches on batteries , and thinks she has to cook everything in the kitchen at mealtime . she seems a genuine betty crocker given that her favorite foods are nuts and bolts . jon lovitch also tries to prop up ackroyd and this weak script . however , his contribution seems way overstated to me . he does n't have much to do . funny are the scenes inwhere the teenage girl eventually decides that her step-mother is not like other people . basinger 's character has a magic purse with an annoying creepy critter in it who tells her what to do . think , jar-jar blinks . i suppose it 's ok as a backdrop for housecleaning . but that 's it . flat and mechanical
dvd	second straight-to-video sequel to 1995 's `` the substitute '' has part-time mercenary , part-time substitute teacher treat williams taking over for a college professor who was brutally beaten by her juiced-up jock students . williams and his new team of operatives are out to uncover a steroid scandal linking the university 's football team to a local mafia goon . pretty good in a dumb saturday afternoon movie type of way but the third act is more cheesy and full of holes then ... well , swiss cheese , i guess
dvd	i idiotilcy got this dvd because of colin firth , and , as you can see , it sucks . btw , this is not `` prasadjonnalagadda '' but rather his daughter , he just comes to buy crap , but never reads the reviwes . anyways , i had better time watching a syndicated simpsons ' episode than watching this bomb . at first , i thought that this movie might 've had some potential because of the suberb stars : colin firth and minnie driver ( good will hunting , won an oscar for it ) i did not yet know heather grahm , but after this movie , i hate her now ! i will admit , she was alright up until she got drunk in the car . that . was . annying beyond reason . other than that , the film 's set up is absolutly horrible , starting off with colin coming to a town just because it 's called hope ? and falling in love with someone only after a couple of days ? and there is also the horrible music that does n't fit the mood at all whenever they play at the scene . pepole , i originnaly gave this a 2 star for colin and minnie , but heather is responsible for everything else .
dvd	i encourage anyone who enjoys superman and wants to relive a bit of your childhood in fun-filled nostalgia , to purchase the entire series of the `` adventures of superman '' ( played by george reeves ) ; the full set of all the episodes consists of 12 packed dvd 's ( i got mine all at once in a 3-pack collection , saving a little $ $ ) . this is your chance to view the entire superman tv series , from the first episode to the last ( prematurely ending with the death of george reeves )
dvd	p.d . james ' mysteries rank as outstanding entertainment . this cd featuring roy marsden as adam dagliesch is excellent . it has well developed characters , a complex plot involving actions that took place years before , and scenes in both london and on england 's coast . i highly recommend this product
dvd	in response to the earlier reviewer , this is sergio garrone 's django il bastardo , not the other film the reviewer mentioned . django il bastardo is a small gem among spaghetti westerns , a low budget b movie in which a ghost ( django ) avenges his own death ( a topic later adapted by clint eastwood for his `` high plains drifter '' ) . hence , steffen 's `` wooden '' acting is totally appropriate for the role . a little jewel with nice gothic atmosphere , innovative camera tricks and good supporting actors ( a standout is luciano rossi as the main baddie 's insane brother )
dvd	beware ! this is not the tv series as described by the first reviewer ( not the reviewer 's fault ) . this is instead , the movie version of `` return to treasure island '' , and the tv version is by a different distributor
dvd	this film harks back to a time when africentricity was woven into the psyche of the younger generation . blackness informed all of their life decisions and defined their aesthetic . this is definitely true of the younger generation in this film . another dynamic at play in this film is a sort of intergenerational upheaval . some members of the older generation were reconsidering their long held beleifs on what it meant to be black in america while the rest of the older generation stood firm staunchly defending their fossilized ideals . so if you 're in the mood to see a comedic family film with a post sixties revolutionary air view `` five on the black hand side '' and breathe in the culture
dvd	i just watched `` mommie dearest '' for the first time tonight . as most critics and fans of `` mommie dearest '' acknowledge , the film portrays such a pitiful story of abuse , with such an over-dramatic ( but entirely true-to-life ) performance by faye dunaway , it was both hilarious and depressing . i 'm 30 and did n't know much about joan crawford outside of the endless chatter about the film being `` classic camp . '' seems to me crawford was probably bi-polar or had some other unexplained mental disorder . i think she was quite aware that some of the insanity she lived with was caused by movie industry she was dedicated to . she knew the industry poisoned any good thing she endeavored to do , whether it was having a successful marriage , a happy family , or even giving to charity . her life was a running commercial directed by hollywood , not unlike the tabloid-driven , image-obsessed hollywood we have today . despite the often-times hilarious image of her and her sibling 's victimization on film , christina 's abuse and disappointment with her mother was real and painful at some point in her life . christina crawford was completely justified turning her mother 's image on its head with her book and movie . yes , the movie is outrageous but it is also empowering . after all , what can the powerless do about their pitiful past except laugh . mocking the unexplained , unjustified pain you experienced in the past , renders it powerless to harm your future . this is the legacy of `` mommie dearest '' whatever joan crawford really was
dvd	it 's my first semester teaching a general-student jazz history course , and i wanted something beyond the textbook to get the students involved . i bought this video as a `` best-of-all-options '' choice , and was bowled over by it 's thoroughness and attention to detail . everything we 'd discussed about armstrong during class was there on the tape , reinforcing my lectures and giving the kids a nice opportunity to both hear and see the legendary louis . for pure entertainment alone it was worthwhile , but for instructional purposes i 'd consider it a necessity for any future jazz classes i 'd teach . i paid $ 16 bucks for it , but having seen it i think i'd 've paid fifty ! ( shh ! do n't tell amazon !
dvd	this is a most beautiful movie . i can`t imagine anyone not enjoying it . the two disc package is brilliant and i will be heirlooming mine to stay in the family long after i have gone
dvd	this is not a good movie ! bad acting , story , and picture ! i was hoping this would be the first anime of the 8man after dvd i had but alass it was not . pass on this one unless u have 2 have it
dvd	maybe it helps to be unfamiliar with chekov 's work and therefore have no preconceived notions , but i found this british made drama to be absorbing and quietly powerful in depicting the sadness and futility of pre-revolution russia . the story of a once wealthy family slowly accepting their loss of prestige and slendor blooms like a beautiful but lonely rose , and thankfully the depths of the drama never get very sloppy , sentimental , or even tragic
dvd	i love the office . what i do n't love is amazon listing a 3-disc boxed set of seasons 1 and 2 and the 2 bbc specials for sale and then mailing me 2 separate discs of seasons 1 and 2 . so be aware that amazon is not shipping what they advertise here . i have contacted them and have had not a reply about this
dvd	unable to see the movie . received the original shipment , and later a replacement , and both had the same defects and we were unable to watch the movie
dvd	well , at least she does for my 3 and a half year old daughter . each episode is compact with a simple theme covering the whole educational gambet . beware , the theme song may start to make adults twitch after a while . the dvd has a different narrator than the original ( neal morrissey ) videos , but all in all a good viewing for the under 5s
dvd	i placed a wrong order and so now i am not able to watch the dvd i purchased . it was for area no 1 , but we ca n't watch the no 1 area movies in turkey . therefore i do not have a review
dvd	a great exercise tape -- plenty of variety and feels like it is doing the trick . if only denise would come into the house and make me exercise daily , this would really work
dvd	very pleased with the quality of the product and the timely delivery
dvd	most boring of the barbie movies , i am sure glad my daughter has stopped asking to watch it over and over . and when it is so boring it seems to drag on forever . and i agree with another reviewer , princess and the pauper and rapunzel , much better ! ! !
dvd	i would love to review this lions gate dvd , but i ca n't catch one word in ten . it is not , as advertised , closed-captioned , and the characters ' speech is too casual and british for me to get . drat ! -- i was so chuffed to see there was a cc version
dvd	this is a rather peculiar film for seagal , and the first thing that should be pointed out to any seagal fan contemplating whether or not to give this one a try is that this is really not an action film . seagal only has a couple fight scenes in the whole film and they are all extremely brief . in fact , they are extraordinarily brief , though thankfully free of wirefu . though out of reach is by no means a total failure ( it 's actually pretty entertaining , seagal as always is fun to watch , and some of the scenes are well done ) , the script nevertheless exhibits some problems and plot holes . this film is a drama about a nature nut ( seagal ) who roams the forest looking for injured animals . he has a pen pal in poland , a young girl , and when he hears that she will no longer be able to correspond with him he becomes so upset that he travels abroad to look for her , even though he really has no reason to suspect that anything is wrong with her . this brings up the main problem with this film , namely , a lot of it simply does n't make any sense . it turns out that the girl has been sold to a human trafficking ring , and seagal goes through the motions to save her . as per usual with seagal nowadays , he obviously refused to actually finish the production , and so we have the usual dubbing problem here . it is even more salient than usual in this picture , however , for here we have not one , but several different people dubbing seagal 's voice , none of whom even remotely sound a thing like him ! here the most frequently heard fill-in for seagal sounds like a knock-off benecio del toro with a much higher-pitched voice . as you can imagine , the effect is very humorous . as stated above , the main problem with this movie is that it simply does n't make sense , which was apparently realized by the director , as he has , in many scenes , the voice fill-in for seagal narrating an explanation of what the character is thinking ! how obnoxious ! seagal 's character likes to teach codes and ciphers to his pen pal , which she later uses to communicate with seagal . what makes no sense is that every time she leaves a message for seagal , the villian , ineptly played by matt schultz , sees the girl doing it and yet leaves the message for seagal to find ! in one ridiculous scene the girl arranges some caviar on crackers to make a code . ( apparently three crackers of one kind followed by three crackers of another kind followed by three crackers of another kind means `` this is a trap . '' ) the villain sees her doing this , and , instead of destroying the message ( which would make sense ) , later has it delivered to seagal ! huh ? in a scene when the girl leaves a message on a mirror telling seagal where she is , the villian sees her doing it , comments on how clever she is , but then leaves the message ! there are also quite of few mistakes in this film , several of which are laughably obvious . at the beginning and end of this film , for example , seagal has long hair which looks like frizzy , black cotton candy being pulled off the back of his head . during the rest of the film , however , he has short hair . at the end , after some bs macho dialogue about how seagal hates taking life but will enjoy killing schultz slowly , each character uncocks his pistol even though schultz 's pistol does not have an external hammer to uncock , and even though in the very next closeup seagal 's pistol is still cocked ! after a sword fight , which ends on a classic move from older chambara films , notice that there is clearly no blood on the floor , and that then , all-of-a-sudden , there is a huge trail of blood between the two characters . in the finale , the above-mentioned sword fight , the camera cuts between closeups of the two characters to faraway shots that are clearly of someone other than seagal . this brings up another frequent complaint of many seagal fans : his overuse of stunt doubles . it 's almost so bad now that one could say that he does n't even film his own fight scenes now . have you ever noticed that in lord steven 's early films , when there was a fight scene the camera would pull back and let you see his moves ? now what happens ? the camera gets as close as possible , shows some shots of his face grunting , shows some arms playing paddycake , then pulls back showing some fighting while never showing seagal 's face . ever wonder why ? it 's because , surprise , surprise , that 's not seagal doing the fighting . in the gun fight , which is actually a very decent action scene , watch seagal as he enters the room . his character enters the fight by doing a foward aikido roll , which is probably the simplest move in aikido , though it is obvious that it is not seagal doing the roll . what is even more irksome is that both at the beginning and the end of the film , which shows seagal 's character `` roaming the forest looking for injured animals , '' or whatever , it is clearly not seagal that we see walking through the forest . was he afraid that he 'd trip over a branch and injure himself ? was he afraid he 'd be attacked by an injured animal in the woods ? i do n't know . what is likely the case is that seagal again refused to finish the shoot and some scenes had to be constructed after-the-fact , using another actor , in order to make the film work . i 'm really not bashing seagal , i 'm merely complaining because these are persistent types of flaws in his recent films that could very easily be fixed . be on the lookout for the bizarre scene when seagal goes to the post office . the postal worker calls seagal `` mr. delacraw , '' or some such bizarre name , even though his character 's name is actually billy ray lancing . seagal then proceeds to mumble some french to the man , and then suddenly adopts a cajun accent . this scene is downright strange . what is also strange is how seagal is dressed in this scene -- like some kind of new orleans anne rice fan , vampire wannabe in a strange , black fur coat . i do n't know , at least it 's good for a laugh . if seagal continues in this manner he will quickly find himself unemployable . the only truly schocking thing is that this has n't happened yet . he shows up late to shoots , leaves early , refuses to finish productions , and yet people keep hiring the man . he repeatedy refuses to do the requisite work for a complete production . he needs to start finishing his films . in closing , out of reach only has two very brief fight scenes , but they are somewhat well done . seagal actually takes a few blows in the climatic fight , which is a very nice change and certainly makes his character seem more human .
dvd	i first viewed this movie on cable , that same night , i purchased the movie from this seller . to date , i have had no responses to email , no communication what so ever , and still have not received this tape in the mail . very disappointed , and not recommended to purchase from this seller
dvd	git-r-done is a nonstop display of a brilliant comedic genius known as larry the cable guy . larry never ceases to pull off witty punchlines that at first go over your head , but end up doubling you over with laughter . his preformance will definitely torque your brain , so be prepared . there are a couple instances where larry goes a little too far and really flexes his mental might leaving you feeling fragile and insecure . one such occurance is his bit about grandma farting like a machine gun . i was left very confused and uncertain of myself until it dawned on me that larry was just messing with me because we all know girls do n't fart , they do n't even have buttholes . he then tries to pull a fast one when he proclaims he never works out ever . unless you are an idiot , you know you ca n't look like him without a strict training regiment , nice try larry . he finally sounds off with an insightful and powerful anti-hillary clinton piece . this was the icing on the cake for me because when i think of intelligent political commentary , i think larry the cable guy ! ! ! !
dvd	who would give the green light to this ? it is a total remake of the 1968 classic . the only difference is that there is a slight revamp to reflect modern times . since it mirrors the original then it deserves what the biggest complaint hsould be of it ... it pales in comparison to the original . this was really weird to remake this movie . `` dawn of the dead '' was cool b/c it had a new , fresh spin to the story . this has no scares , no atmosphere , no innovations and no riveting performances . skip this one
dvd	they do't make musicals like this anymore . well , they do n't really make musicals anymore , do they ? they used to make them , made them well and they came out like `` down argentine way . '' the plot is just enough to keep your interest but the music is bright , costumes lavish and not a few laughts . the major players- betty grable and don ameche- are as engaging as usual.carmen miranda makes her us film debut and sings , dances and mispronounces her way to stardom . the 20th century fox role players appear ( charlotte greenwood , j. carrol naish , henry stephenson ) and add to the fun .
dvd	this is a ridiculous overkill of two fascinating characters in the 'lonesome dove ' . the whole 2 dvds were just a bunch of idiots kept blabbering , small talking , yammering , blah , blah , blah from the first second to the last minute , just like mcmurty 's novels , all the characters were just kept talking , talking , talking in meaningless small talks , almost talked your ears off . it 's so controversial and contradictory to those two characters first appeared in 'lonesome dove ' , gus talked and talked , but call never talked like what was protrayed in this pathetic 'dead man 's walk ' and the 'comanchi moon ' , the more logic one is the real sequel , 'the street of loredo ' , at least gus was dead , and call remained not just silent but more quiet . by watching this horrible movie adaptation from the original book , scripted by the author , the whole movie was doomed to be horrible . because mcmurty simply could n't omitted those yammering spread all over his original novel , page after page , blah , blah , blah , and we have to find the storyline among those conversations , dialogs , and dug them out of those garbage-like paragraphs . watching this movie was no different . those idiotic morons never kept their mouths shut . blabbering day and night , even during the comanchi attacks . what call showed in this movie and the novel could never developed into a character like what he had become in 'lonesome dove ' . because from the very beginning , everybody just quacked and quacked like a school of chickens . drive me nuts . how come these two young characters portrayed in this blabbering novel would and could have developed into the profound older characters in the 'lonesome dove ' ? once a moron , a coward , an idiot , always would be a one , no matter how old you have become . adding experiences and sophistication in the aging process never happened to a moron , coward or an idiot . how could these two jokes would have survived in that harsh environment is simply beyond me . at least the 'lonesome dove ' movie adaptation was close to what the novel read like . and 'the street of loredo ' movie was also an adaptations from the novel
dvd	i still have not received this dvd . it was ordered on 12/8/06 and was supposed to ship on 12/12/06 . i am very upset that it did not arrive as it was a christmas gift . i can not rate the product as i do n't have it . i sent an e-mail through amazon to jrmovies several days ago and have not heard from them . i would appreciate a response or a refund
dvd	although many reviewers did n't like the second part of the `` hills '' , i still would n't call it `` one of the worst sequels ever '' or `` the worst wes craven film '' . certainly this is not a masterpiece , even in the framework of horror genre , but i do n't see why it should be worse than any other slasher flick . when i was watching it , i came to a conclusion early wes craven had been imitating other directors rather often . i 'm not saying he was not original at all - eventually he shot `` a nightmare on elm street '' in 1984 . but `` the hills have eyes '' were reminiscent of `` texas chainsaw massacre '' , and in the beginning of 80s , when slasher era started , i guess craven decided to make something in the same manner . maybe the reason was craven 's long-time buddy sean cunningham created `` friday the 13th '' in 1980 , and wes was envious ? : ) anyway the second part of `` the hills have eyes '' turned out to be a pure slasher like many others at that time . and it obviously was n't the worst and in many ways was like above mentioned `` friday the 13th '' : the score was written by harry manfredini , known to every `` friday '' fan , and the music in `` hills 2 '' is just like in early `` fridays '' . the body count increased comparing to the first part and approached a regular slasher movie . kevin blair who had a leading male part here , would star in `` friday the 13th part vii '' a couple of years later along with kane hodder , who did stunts for `` the hills have eyes 2 '' and in `` friday '' would play you know whom . of course here we can see some stupidities as in other slasher movies ( like characters wandering in night all alone instead of sticking together , all the big strong guys get killed , and a handicapped girl survives - i 'm not even considering it as a spoiler for it is obvious from the very beginning , especially if you 've seen a couple of horror films in your life ) , but is that a problem for a true horror fan ? we 've learned not to take this trivia into account . so i think `` the hills have eyes 2 '' managed on many levels , and it would be interesting to have it in your collection , if you have the first one . for they are two totally different films talking about the subgenres of horror .
dvd	this movie was cheeseball beginning to end ... i thought the concept was corny even before i watched it but decided to give it a try anyway . big mistake . a robot who can love ? lame ! and with all this high tech stuff the docs ca n't bring the couple 's real son out of a coma ( or whatever was wrong with him ) so the parents forget all about him and get some robot kid who can 'love ' but lacks the common sense of a human making him a danger to himself and everyone..brialliant plan ( especially considering the amount of orphan human kids there must be in this messed up futuristic world ) ..then the real son wakes up and comes home and thats when the problems with the robot kid begin . the family decides they do n't want the robot and the mom 'loves ' him so much she dumps him somewhere instead of sending him back to the lab to be humanely disposed of ... it was then i knew i was smelling a stinker but nooooo someone else wanted to watch it till the end until he soon found out the horrible truth ... i have since nicknamed it artificial idiocy ... the worst part was the end , ugh , i do n't even want to get into it but those of you who see the title of my review above and have seen the movie know what i mean . the whole plot was muddled and full of holes with no sense of realism . for those of you who have not seen it , i suggest renting it before you buy it . maybe this movie is great for some people , it just was n't my thing .
dvd	i 'm not usually a ballet person . i have n't seen anything since `` the nutcracker '' when i was six . but this was absolutely brilliant . the concept for it is completely bold and original and adam cooper as the swan blew me away . how can you beat a dancer in black leather pants with a riding crop ? tchaikovsky never would have envisioned this , but he would be utterly thrilled to see what they have done with his epic ballet .
dvd	there 's not much to say about the reputation of these movies . there 's also little to say about these dvds , many of which are the high quality special edition collections . just do the math . this is no brainer for people who do n't own any of these dvds . even if you only want 8 of them ( less than half ! ) , that 's about $ 20.00 a movie ( at amazon 's present sales price ) and since many of these movies are special editions , that 's still a steal ! this is a solid place to start your dvd collection . not everyone will enjoy all these movies ( after all , they range from westerns to romantic pieces to musicals ) , but at this price even giving half of them away still allows you a tremendous savings . one note : the version of amadeus here is the reissue and the longer , director 's cut of the movie that was not originally released . some ( including myself ) prefer the tighter original release ( which can still be gotten at amazon but sadly has no commentary and requires you to flip the disc in the middle of the movie ! )
dvd	i am an alice fan , so this is far far from my favorite . the first star i gave was simply because i love kate beckinsale and the movie is n't scary . the other is because it would be enchanting for a 3-4 year old or another youngster that does n't know anything about wonderland . my 9 year old even got bored with this . kate beackinsale plays the mother in the beginning , and in 1999 she was much too young to be and definitely looked so . she just did n't look well in this movie , and everything looked so cheap and fake . the story was changed in all the wrong places and too much was left out . i would not recommend this . i would recommend the 1999 american mini series of alice in wonderland , it is my absolute favorite ; with martin short as the mad hatter , and a long list of big names . that one is fun for all ages
dvd	this was a delightful view into the highs and lows of courtship , love , jealousy , and hate and what havoc can be wrought by schemes devised to satisfy emotional turmoil . with the lovely backdrop of italy , all is well that ends well for the characters . michael keaton as comic relief is brilliant .
dvd	i bought the dvd with this artwork out of a dollar bin and i got what i paid for . the image is fuzzy and the audio is of poor quality . this must have been taken from a 16mm print . it may be that this film is in public domain , so it may be difficult to find a decent quality dvd . there are many issues of this film so you would do better to try one of the other dvd issues . note : amazon seems to spread these reviews across dvds of the same title , so you may see this review under multiple dvd releases of `` meet john doe '' . the poor quality dvd that i bought has a cover that looked like this : [ ...
dvd	this was purchased as a gift for my sister . she has said that the dvd set is great . she is a fan of alias
dvd	the transfer is real real bad , the story is also weird but its o
dvd	does anyone know if there is a real pg-13 version of this film ? i 've been told it came out as a pg-13 and then was changed to an r film . pretty strange way to deal with a science fiction film that kids would want to see..
dvd	such a kiddie classic..so cute im 22 and had to have this because i loved it as a ki
dvd	we all feel alone at times ... this is something 'lost in translation ' brilliantly shows its audience.. indeed loneliness often , paradoxically , occurs in highly populated areas.. it is as if the more people we are surrounded by the more alienated we feel - the more our differences stand out ... bill murray is superbly cast as the outsider celebrity guy , who dose n't seem to quite know why he is where he is , and why he is treated the way he is - in a culture and a pace of life so distant from his way of seeing and experiencing reality.. this is a very promosing feature from sofia coppola.. it captures hotel life in a way that only direct experiene could top.. this also sort of represents the zenith of bill murray 's career and perhaps his best performance to date .
dvd	at last ! a full-length jimmy buffett concert on dvd ! it 's been a while coming but this is a beauty . there are so many highlights it 's hard to know where to start - perhaps the best place is the overall quality of the dvd . the sound is superb , the camera-work spot on and the real essence of a jimmy buffett concert is captured perfectly . the song mix is terrific - everything from buffett classics like volcano , to new classic like piece of work , to iconic covers like southern cross . seeing jimmy and the coral reefers perform in daylight and night-time is a nice touch and the crowd shots show why a buffett concert is such an all-encompassing experience ! for me , a favourite moment is the concert finale of steve goodman 's city of new orleans . steve now resides under home plate at wrigley and i 'm sure he was singing along as well . buffett fans and new parrotheads alike will find this dvd one to watch many times over
dvd	well you know the drill . some people will like anything that is `` artsy '' or `` out of the ordinary '' or `` made by that great director '' . its a different kind of herd but a herd nevertheless . the movie is about incest . it is about sex and adolescence . and , ironically , it is some kind of a parody of the very crowd that is giving this movie rave reviews . the best part of this movie is eva green . or , more precisely , eva green 's body . i did n't care about her acting ( i thought it was mediocre ) . i just sat there and drunk her body in , wishing that i was that lucky actor ( whats his name again ? ) . the only reason to watch this movie is eva green . if she was indeed exploited by the elderly director with an intimidating reputation , then i am glad it happened . the movie is visually rich . in fact , its so rich that bertolucci seems to be masturbating his sensibilities for us all to see . but i will take it . he captures and celebrates eve green 's stunning body - every square millimeter of it ( including her genitals - the movie is nc17 for a reason ) , to perfection . other than that , there is nothing else in the movie . the story is utterly insipid , the old movie clips , the `` discussion '' of morality or whatever ... nothing interesting . the music is another plus point . bottomline , watch it for eva green 's body . it deserves five stars . but the movie deserves only two
dvd	it is a well made movie based on a great book . i was particularly impressed by the performance of the leading actors deborah findley and ciara'n hinds . following their play , you can feel in the whole the deepness and the manifold of the characters
dvd	i saw this movie years ago , but did n't remember much about it , except some of the songs , and the basic story . i also saw `` nights of cabiria '' , from which the story was taken . i love musicals , and i think shirley maclaine is very talented . she is very sweet as charity hope valentine , and one ca n't help wanting a happy ending for her . so why did i think this movie was awful ? first of all , some of the dialogue was so repetitious it became irritating -- how many times can you listen to charity say `` fickle finger of fate '' over and over without wanting to hit the mute button ? also , some of the scenes went on and on and on -- especially the elevator scene . and -- the intermission was totally unnecessary . but the worst disappointment for me was the musical numbers . i did n't like any of them -- - they were so far over the top as to be silly . bob fosse must have thrown everything into them that he could -- - instead of letting the dancers and the songs carry the numbers , he had so much busyness in all of them -- too many people , costumes that did n't fit the story , silly moves -- and they all went past the point of enjoyment . i fast forwarded thru a couple of them just to get them over with . i have never done that before with any movie . this could have been so much better -- the story was good , the charactors were good -- but the whole thing should have been toned down . the movie could have been 30 minutes shorter if there had been some trimming . it was entirely too long . also -- - all that stop action -- what was that all about ? i know , i know -- it was to show the progress of the story , but it was a distraction . i did n't like the movie and was glad when it was over .
dvd	compared to argento , i must say that mario bava is for me entirely overrated . he might be a pioneer , but as a stylist he is sadly lacking . his seventies work is more often than not tiresome and tawdry , even if you like horror films . argento fans seeking out 'shock ' on the strength of daria nicolodi 's starring role , music by two members of goblin ( under the nom-de-plume 'a.libra ) and srgento 's supposed giallio-based debt to bava should buy 'shock ' with caution . although it is an authentic slice of eurohorror and better than the contemporary garbage horror hollywood churns out , it is still a fairly dreary , dull , repetitive flick with few high points and many annoyances . finally , the sound and picture quality are fairly poor even when compared to some of jess franco 's rubbish ( and that 's saying something ) - my dvd of the silly 'she killed in ecstasy ' , filmed years before this looks and sounds far far better . shame daria never made films without argento that are better than this..
dvd	this went up from one * in tribute to the neat hammy acting job from alec guiness as charles ii , but otherwise its just a mess . the film called out for a screenplay by a robert bolt or a john prebble , but instead it was penned by its director kenneth hughes , who also gave us such film masterpieces as `` casino royale '' and `` chitty chitty bang bang '' . richard harris is his usually unrestrained self , and thats not a compliment . now , i wont even go into the politics , which attempt to portray oliver cromwell as some sort of liberating hero : as ridiculous a take on the english civil wars as alexandre dumas 's paean to charles ii in `` twenty years after '' , but nowhere near as entertaining .
dvd	this could possibly be the cheesiest movie i have ever seen ( and i have seen a lot of movies ! ) do not waste your money on this low-budget , low-acting-ability , low-camera-experience movie . i enjoy a good `` gay movie '' every now and then and this was not it . sorry to disappoint
dvd	i always love it when prevention release another workout because i get bored easy and i like to mix workouts up . i 've loved all of the other prevention workouts and knew i 'd love this too . chris freytag leads again and does another superb job . there are two aerobic routines and five targeted toning workouts . the dvd is programmable so you can do them in any order and do as many or as little as you want . that 's a big plus so you do n't get bored or pushed for time . you can choose whether you need to lose weight or just firm up etc . if , for example , you pick that you need to lose weight , there is a six day week with the routines mapped out for you already . that is so helpful . the moves are all basic no frills moves , but they are effective . the first cardio section is low impact and the second is a variety of low and higher impact moves making it just that little bit harder . the body parts are all the ones you want to workout ; arms , butt , abs and thighs . all you really need for this dvd is dumbells and a lot of energy . this is so easy to do due to the programming , so there really is no excuse for not working out . this can be done by practically anyone . i also love how the other two girls exercising as well , are n't the kinds that yell and shout etc . they are as professional as chris
dvd	sorry , but this movie blew ! the premise was there , but the delivery just sucked . i can only take the suspension of belief so far . we are supposed to believe that this guy has never told his new gf ( whom he 's been w/for at least a year ) about his last , one before that , and gf before that . at least two of them have his home phone number : they 've never called ? she 's never seen the caller id ? she 's never answered the phone ? give me a break ! then she holds fake interviews with the exes and just opens up the most ridiculous can of worms . she meets up with joyce ( the most recent ) whom she finds out that she genuinely likes , and starts believing that the bf should really be with her . joyce is none the wiser , but if you ask me , joyce had stalker qualities b/c she harassed him when he was with the model , calls his house right back when she gets the call on her phone , keeps that stupid boomerang in a frame , etc . this chick , stacy ( brittany m ) had to be incredibly stupid not to see where this was ultimately going . holly hunter 's character is precisely why i have more male friends than female . stacy just met this woman and she 's revealing all these things about her personal life and this woman is all too happy to help her wallow in the craziness of this movie . i never expected the 'big climax , ' but i did ask myself several times `` will this barb ( hh ) chick back the **** off ? ! '' on to the climax : it was actually a surprise , but what blew me was that everything ended up honky dory for stacy ... after she humiliated all those people . i never got the impression that the bf ( derrick ) was cheating on her , yet that tacky talk show would have made you think different . the only reason he pissed me off was because he did n't read stacy the riot act in the end . this movie tries to wax philosophical , and you just end up hating all of the characters ... except for the dog . a very passible movie . i would n't even bother .
dvd	by winning their third title in four years the same year that the baseball team that defines the hopes and dreams of generations of new englanders wins its first world series in 86 years . it 's true , the patriots somehow pieced together a team that , despite a string of injuries that seemed to defy all rationality and managed to finish a second consecutive campaign as super bowl champions with a 17-2 record ( which just as easily could have/should have been 18-1 ) ... but the 2004 boston red sox completely sucked the oxygen out of the american sports atmosphere and somehow the 2004 patriots season just does n't seem to measure up to the previous title years of 2001 and 2003 . part of the reason is that the previous years seemed to have their own personalities ( 2001 having 9/11 , the coming-of-age of tom brady , the snow bowl , and the unbelievable finish of what was probably the most exciting super bowl ever . 2003 had the release of lawyer milloy , the early stumbles to buffalo and washington , the birth of the winning streak , winter weather in foxboro , and yet another thrilling super bowl finish ) ; 2004 just seemed like an anticlimax by comparison , like you were watching a scripted performance that was always going to end with the `` w '' on the patriots ' side of the field . this is not to say that there were not intriguing challenges that made for good storytelling ... the injuries ( leading to the incredible `` throwback '' two-way play of veteran wide receiver/rookie cornerback troy brown ) , the continued winning streak , the rebirth of offseason acquisition corey dillon , the continuing mastery of the indianapolis colts , and the return to pittsburgh ( where the record 21-game winning streak came to an emphatic end on halloween ( just days after the red sox won the world series , karmically enough ) , where university of michigan graduate tom brady resurrected himself from a triple-digit fever the night before to thoroughly dismantle the best regarded defense in the nfl to send the patriots back to the super bowl , this time in the unfairly maligned city of jacksonville , fl . no nail-biting endings this time , though ... despite the best efforts of terrell owens to come back from a leg and ankle injury that would have ended the season of anyone else ( with the possible exception of curt schilling , of course ) , the eagles all-pro was clearly the second-best receiver on the field as deion branch won the super bowl mvp for a record day ( safetyman and render of mayhem extraordinaire rodney harrison would have been my pick , actually ) and the patriots , though trailing early , never really seemed in doubt of winning a game they led by 10 points late before prevailing by the final score of 24-21 which in truth flattered the eagles more than they deserved . far be it that a season ending with a record of 17-2 and another super bowl ring should be considered hum-drum , but there was something missing from the 2004 campaign that , impressive as it was , just does n't translate to the memorable re-telling that the pats ' previous title years do . this is a great dvd for pats fans , indispensible even , but for the casual fan who appreciates the drama that a good nfl season can bring , i would recommend either of the previous patriots highlights dvd 's over this one
dvd	there is a pattern in hollywood when it comes to drama/revenge films such as eye for an eye . it is an extremely simple pattern that is regenerated time and time again because audiences like to not be surprised . they are prepared for the bad guy to die at the end , whilst the victim or top-billed actor/actress comes out as the hero at the end . it is meant to give us a sense of security and comfort , but for this critic it is getting old . eye for an eye is a perfect example of film that falls deep within that tired genre of film . from the opening credits of this film , you could count the steps that each actor was going to make all the way to the very end . the pauses could be guessed , the lines could have been written the night before , and the acting was nothing short of mediocrity at its best . it was guaranteed that the actors would be overly dramatic , the violins would always shrill around kiefer , and there would be horrendously underdeveloped plotlines that would lead nowhere . this is your typical revenge film with no excitement , no frills , nothing that would make it stand out from the rest . the late director john schlesinger played it safe with one of his final films , which will promise to bore and completely not satisfy you to the bitter end . where did eye for an eye go wrong ? i do n't think i need to count all the ways for you , but some of the bigger issues that i had with this feature was the complete unknown of the characters . i have major issues with stories that escape realism to allow the main character to seem more dramatic . what was sally field 's job ? i know that is a small detail , but it better highlights my complaint that our central family ( the mccanns ) were not as developed as i would have liked to have seen . i had no clue her daughter had a stutter until two seconds before her death , yet it seemed to be a bigger key element as the film progressed . ed harris literally walked through his character , proving that field 's husband could have been played by a plastic bag and still seen the same level of emotion . the only character worth watching , and was developed briefly , was kiefer . he was 100 % evil in this film and it kept this film geek worth watching until the very end . yet , we did n't even know that much about him either ( which upset me ) . schlesinger obviously knew the story that he was about to tell with eye for an eye very well , the actors i believe even knew the story and they probably did n't even need to read the script , and the story played it safe from the beginning , but it was n't what i wanted to see . i expected film like this to come out during the 80s , not in 1996 . it was pathetic to see name actors like ed harris , sally field , phillip baker hall , keith david , and kiefer sutherland walk through this film like it was a fly in the pan . nothing stood out in this film , nothing made me want to rewatch the brutality of it , and nothing made me feel excited about these actors . this was a literal `` nothing '' film . it lent nothing to the cinematic world except ( and i stress this a bit ) another peg in a very tired genre known as the `` revenge thriller '' . after watching this film i said to my wife that i thought sally field was completely overdramatic throughout the course of it , overplaying the small parts and completely exploding the bigger elements , which made me think of a high school drama production . it was amateur at best , but she said that is why directors use sally , because she is known for being overly dramatic . this is a pure example of a good thing gone badly . sally saw success with it once , but as she continues it only creates bad cinema . there were times during sally 's bigger speeches that i found myself laughing . i could n't help myself , but her focus on certain words and clichï¿½ reaction to others just seemed cardboard instead of lifelike . the same could be said for ed harris who obviously has discovered that he does n't have to play the outlaying father any further in films . he was completely wasted in this film . was there any emotion with him ? i did n't see any . then there was the pitiful contribution by hall and david that begin with intrigue , but were dropped faster than a big ole sack of potatoes . also , did mantegna take a class on how to be a one-dimensional clichï¿½ ? urg , his portrayal of the police office was a disgrace to those that genuinely play one-dimensional police officers . again , the only actor worth watching was kiefer because he not only spoke with evil , but demonstrated that he was capable of anything vile . it was his sole performance that made this film decent to watch to the end . if i have to talk about the story i think i am just going to go mad myself . field over dramatized the entire film , thus creating uncertainty amongst the viewer . did kiefer get a bad image because he was bad or because field wanted to see him as evil ? that could have been a great avenue for this film to travel , but alas , ole safe schlesinger did n't take us down that darker path . i needed more to develop what hall and david were doing at the support groups , but it seemed like that story was dropped rather quickly as the ending needed to be wrapped up gently in a comfort blanket for viewers . this was yet another dark avenue that was not explored . i felt as if i saw these dark avenues with the director and the cast , yet we chose to stay on the lighted path . that , coupled with the poor acting , just created a film that did n't catch my attention and fully contributed nothing to the cinematic world . overall , in case it was n't obvious , this was n't a good movie at all . in fact , i could go through the rest of my life without thinking of this movie again . i thought only horror movies had the stated scream rules and somehow could stick to the same tired pattern over and over again , but with eye for an eye it became obvious that it the `` revenge thrill '' fell into that same pattern . the only trouble is that horror films actually have fun with that repetitive structure , this film did not . sally field was horrible and should really consider a strong independent film to bring her back to the spotlight , while everyone else was forgettable . the only fun part was watching jack bauer play the epitome of evil . watch this film for kiefer , but nothing else . skip it ! grade : * out of ****
dvd	this film is a landmark in blending science and advocacy . it seeks to assert that animals lead complex and sophisticated emotional lives , not unlike our own . but it manages to walk the fine line between subjectivity and objectivity . it avoids going too far into the subjective . it does n't try to emotionally blackmail the viewer with mere cute/stagey displays of animal interaction . instead it relies heavily on scientific observation in both natural and controlled environments . but by the sheer genious of editing and writing , one can not help but be drawn into the lives of these noble creatures just as one would a good drama . the movie wisely lets the animals ' behavior `` do the talking '' , and does n't try to push the viewers ' judgement one way or the other . it left me rethinking everything i had assumed about animals , emotions , and the nature of our ( and by 'our ' i mean all of god 's creatures ) existence
dvd	this is not the restored print of dracula 1931 that universal previously released on dvd a few years earlier.if you have that dvd keep it as the quality on this box set is awful.i can only think that whoever was in charge of compiling this did n't bother to look or did n't know that universal had a fully restored copy of this film
dvd	excelente concierto en el castillo slane en irlanda , bono se entrega a su publico , buen sonido , buenas imagenes , magnificos extras . lo recomiendo dos horas de u
dvd	before i saw this movie i thought i would enjoy it . i enjoyed watching the miniseries when i was a kid . however , nothing could prepare me for what i was about to watch on screen . it was an absolute disaster of a film . i do enjoy superhero movies , some recent ones i like are the spiderman series and batman . but the hulk did not inspire me at all , it was like going to the dentist to get a tooth pulled . the character is a cartoon-like green figure , totally lacking in his emotional capacities , not even his rage convinced me , it looked like a video game more than a movie . this film had no serious plot worthy of mention . it was just plain painful to watch . if i could give it half a star i would !
dvd	amazon.com made sure i received my items in time . above receiving the movie in excellent condition , the movie is entertaining and reminds you what real acting is .
dvd	china : the panda adventure is an imax film that tells a story.. so..in a sense the pandas are a part of this story but not in the sense of a documentary . the story is set in 1936 and is based on a true story involving ruth harkness who has arrived in china to take care of the business affairs of her late husband . her husband , it seems was a great admirer of the giant panda and in his journal he writes a beautiful story about his experiences with them..this leads ruth to seek these pandas out to see for herself..as the story unfolds we see the beauty and majesty of china..the cinematography is outstanding and the music fits the film quite well.. ruth is played by the lovely maria bello and there is an additional documentary about the making of this film is which she talks about her reasons for wanting to do this film and her fascination with the panda.. all in all..this film is a nice way to spend the evening with your family..but be warned..it 's more of a story involving the panda and not a documentary .
dvd	othello is a difficult production for me to watch at any time . seeing the horrors of jealousy run amuck to the destruction of innocence is painful at the best of times . in the instance of this production it is even more painful because it is so well done . the story of othello is that of a venetian general who marries a local daughter of a nobleman . the general happens to be black . in an effort to sabotage the general , iago undermines the faith of the husband for his wife leading ultimately to the tragedy of her death . while shakespeare gives motivations for his characters , interpretations and emphases tend to vary . kenneth brannagh 's production of othello emphasies iago as a troublemake who likes to cause trouble simple for the sake of doing so . this production , with ian mckellan in the role of iago , puts more emphasis on his desire for revenge in reaction to a perceived slight . both are accurate portrayals but the former seems to show more delight in `` being bad '' wheras the latter seems more inclined to `` get even '' . both are excellent and accurate but the emphasis in this film makes the heaviness of the theme that much more difficult to endure . the role of desdemona is portrayed in this version by imogen stubb and she is a delight to watch . she bring an alluring innocence to the role that makes her demise all that much more tragic . so too is the title role played admirably . the problem with othello is that he is at heart and honorable man but lets his passions rule him and cause him to lash out with devatiging consequence . this is a fine performance all around with a difficult play . if you can keep your anger at the antics of the characters in check , it is well worth the time
dvd	a dismal disappointment . i think you should rent it and find out for yourself before you actually own a copy . when i see the high ratings , i wonder if people have some investment in the selling of this product . the original lonesome dove mini series was unbelievably well done . a complete multifaceted joy . i was so excited when i saw there was a sequel and the joy of lonesome dove would continue . well it did n't and you can read why in more depth in other low ratings
dvd	the most simple definition of [ ... ] is sexual gratuitousness . sexual imaging for the sake of turning people on , not providing anything pertinent to the plot . you ca n't help but get a porno feel while watching bully . and to think i was supposed to be viewing a film about teenage revenge on the local bully ; but it turns out to be a soft porn version of how vapid teenagers waste away their lives with a little killing thrown in . was it really necessary to show a shot of a girl 's crotch while she 's driving a car ? was it necessary to have a sex scene or nudity scene or drug scene every 3 minutes ? you ca n't help but see the director as a pervert who is more preoccupied with sex and street cred grittiness than telling a good story . the very first scene is of a guy having phone sex . several things about this movie other than the [ ... ] made me mad : 1 . you 're planning to kill somebody , then proceed to tell everybody , including the waitress at pizza hut what you 're planning . 2 . after you kill , you 're so afraid of being caught that you proceed to put more suspicion on yourself by acting very strange and telling even more people what you did . 3 . which makes more sense ? to decide to kill a guy because he disrespects you and beats you up occasionally and has sex with your girlfriend , or , to stop hanging out with him completely and stop lending your girlfriend out like a wh-ore. bobby never put a gun to the guy 's head to make him hang out with him , yet murder was the only option ? 4 . i ca n't believe mr. wimp who never fights back can all of a sudden muster the strength to slit a guy 's throat while he 's staring him blankly in the face begging for his life . 5 . all of the characters
dvd	i was stunned by this movie . i learned of it and purchased it in 2003 . for various reasons it remains for me the best , most emotional movie i have seen about musicians and their music . the producer chose well : he found the songwriters that shaped country and rock for the next 30 years : townes van zandt , rodney crowell , steve earle , guy clark , steve young , john hiatt , charlie daniels and a tribute to the late skinny dennis , immortalized in guy clark 's `` la freeway . '' i wish david allen coe had been left out , but no film is perfect . the songwriters are shown at their best and worst : a drunken , funny tvz falls into a rabbit hole and silent night is rendered by fine musicians too drunk to remember the lyrics . this movie was made when i was a poor student and musician with a small circle of talented friends in tampa at the university of south florida . the difference is that most of my friends and i got straight jobs [ we still tried to make a difference ] but these musicians changed the world , just a little . i married the singer/business major i met at usf and divorced 30 years later . i still play guitar , write and record at home and dream of making it in music - but mostly i learn songs written by artists like those in this movie and try to understand the magic they have that still captures me . when tvz sang 'waiting around to die ' he brought tears to the eyes of his 70+ blacksmith neighbor , while cindy comforts him . it was magical . tvz does a `` medley of my hit '' and sings `` pancho and lefty , '' and rodney crowell sang `` bluebird wine , '' both covered by emmylou . steve young 's `` alabama highways '' was wonderful too . it was a look into my past - and the past and future of the intelligent , emotional music i love best .
dvd	this is a great film with a bad guy that you root for from start to finish . action packed , and very smart . great cast too
dvd	this dvd was the first one released by michael buble , and i bought it in hopes of seeing some of his live performances . there are segments of performances , but the editing and fast , wild cuts from one angle to the next to the next to the next really detract from the overall effect . the performances get largely lost . what remains is a lot of footage of michael and his original bandmembers drinking , clubbing , gambling , womanizing , and generally acting like rowdy frat boys . if you really want to be wowed and experience what a live buble concert is like , i highly recommend `` caught in the act '' . this dvd lives up to it 's name as part of the pbs great performances series produced by david foster . `` caught in the act '' is slick , glossy , flashy , enormously fun and absolutely true to the real experience . i 've seen buble perform live twice , and i can attest that `` caught in the act '' is just about as good as being there
dvd	great movie - there is n't anything i can say that has n't been said 100 times .
dvd	granted , i saw this movie at about three in the morning at a party , but i think i had enough sense in me to realize how truly horrible it was . it 's so ... bad . it has some seriously subpar performances from pretty much all involved , and the script was just awful . gosh , it 's hard to believe i actually sat through it . it was just so ... exactly what it was , i guess . a stupid sex comedy that 's absolutely terrified to be anything else . the thing that really pushed this above the radar for me to blip at was the truly offensive tone of some of the material . i think my real downfall here was the fact that i 'm a gay guy whose friends are mostly straight guys . the scenes regarding a certain character and his chance encounter with homosexuality are so repugnant it 's almost ridiculous . now , i 'm not one to get offended easily , but this just took it a bit too far . just the attitudes and behaviors expressed by most of the characters just made me depressed , which is n't really something i look for in a movie . it just seems to me that if 'gay ' had been replaced with 'black ' , this would have been deemed racist and probably would n't ever have been released . not that i 'm condoning censorship , but when your tone becomes so ... mocking , i guess . oh well , i guess all i 'm trying to say is i will definitely not be repeat viewing this film , and i do n't recommend you view it at all if you 're a woman , or gay , or you care about others
dvd	i got ta say this movie is an example of a terrible idea , swain husband beats the crap outta her and she spends her time running from him . what 's worse his friend is a lunatic who want swain 's character . swain 's character is a hillbilly who like 's an upper class doctor who she really never connects with , i never really got why swain settled for a lunatic when she was trying to find inner peace thru the whole movie . this movie puts a bad taste in my mouth , it was a waste of my time it wasnt a story it was an excuse to make a bad movie . ( do not buy )
dvd	noel and liam and jarvis are f* hilarious ... damon needs to off himself ... same with the weirdo journalist with the upper-class accent ... this video is good at making britpop seem like an actual period in music ... hahahahaha ... whatever ... besides , everyone knows radiohead and prodigy were quite accepted in the u.s. and were very original ... oasis is an awesome , lethal rock n roll band , anyone who loves rock n roll have to love oasis ... do n't cheat yourself..
dvd	my husband and i loved the original amityville and were so disappointed by this remake . with the special effects we have nowadays i thought this movie would have been great , i was wrong . it was pure hollywood garbage .
dvd	i do n't own a copy of the original cut , and it 's been a while since i 've seen the original cut . a short review of this version is as follows . the film print is flawless in the sense it looks like it was shot in the 70 's or 80 's on purpose . the blue filter is gone , so it does n't look slick and shiny . this film is dark , rich , and grungy . very `` noir-ish '' , and warm . obviously the running gag through out the first film was that porter wants his 70k back ... not 130k or 1 million , just 70k . this was maybe mentioned 3 or 4 times and that was it . the first cut seemed like it was being used more for comedy relief over and over and over again . porter in this film is not charming or smooth . he 's smart , violent , and cold . a true anti-hero . the annoying voice over narration is gone . there are several new characters , and several new brutal kills . minus the credits , this film comes in at a brisk 1 hr and 25 minutes . this is a great companion piece to the great `` to live and die in l.a. '' it got the same mood . i told you this review was going to be short .
dvd	very entertaining movie . i enjoyed everything about this movie -- - the acting , the humor , the singing and storyline ! also being from san diego originally , it was nice to see famous hotel and landmark , the hotel del coronado , being used in this movie as the hotel in which the all girls band performed and stayed ! no the hotel was n't the seminole ritz in florida !
dvd	if you must see a cannibal film stick to cannibal holocaust . the grindhouse release is well worth the money . however the grindhouse release of ferox is just awful . the picture quality is horrendous . the movie is lacking any redeemable quality . there are a few violent moments , but just a few . one of the absolute worst italian horror/exploitation films made . if cannibal holocaust is the citizen kane of cannibal films , then ferox is the plan 9 .
dvd	instead of reviewing the content , my review is based more on the dvd presentation . pros : the dolby digital 5.1 soundtrack is just excellent , with great separation of instrument up front and in back and the great use of surrounds for more that just audience cheering . sound is only second to the shakira unplugged dvd . cons : who ever mastered this dvd must be living in 1997 . this concert was recorded in hd and is usually shown on mtv hd network . the big mistake being that the concert is not anamorphic ( enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) . sure the majority will not care , but for those of you who own hd monitors , you will see the negative in losing that extra resolution and the fact that you have to manually zoom in . second negative being that if you want to start the concert from a specific song , you have to start the concert from the beginning and skip ahead . because if you try to start from the `` song selection '' menu , it will take you back to the menu every time the song you selected ends . overall a great concert , but a disappointing dvd presentation
dvd	this movie was just plain bad . it does n't just stink , it reeks . if i was to say this movie was horrible that would be a compliment . i ca n't believe that the other reviews were so complimentary . it 's the reason why i purchased the movie and i regret my decision . i should have read the reviews more closely . some of the reviewers had n't acutally seen the film while i am convinced that a few of the other reviews were written by people associated with the film . everything about this movie is sup-par . the script was horrible . the sets amateurish . the dialogue stilted . ( and not in the funny style reminiscent of the tv series - which i loved ) . there are a number of things about the movie that were warning signs that this movie was going to stink . first the only footage they used was from the batman movie . not the tv series . i have a feeling that the people who have the rights to the tv series realized that this movie was so bad they did n't want to associate themselves with it . they did n't use the original batmobile but a cheap rip off . i could continue by why make you suffer . the chemistry between adam west and burt ward is non-existent . and the chemistry between the `actors ' playing adam west and burt ward in the `flashback ' scenes is substandard at best . this movie is beyond dreadful . there are cameos from a few villains from the original tv show but they 're dreadful too . not because they are bad actors but because the script and plot are that bad . i wish i could say i laughed . i wish i could say that i at least cracked a smiled but unfortunately all i can say is that i watched this movie in dead silence . do not waste your money or your time on this movi
dvd	pick any house on any street . pick any random two people ( man and woman ) , give them a script and let them go wild . i promise you could make this movie work better than the producers . nothing in this movie stood out and everything about it was boring . the acting and settings in this movie are just horrible . by the end you want everyone to die just to become interested . now , i do n't usually give bad ratings and i really like `` b '' horror films , but the lack of effort here is unbelievable . just nothing to interest me
dvd	excellent presentation and goes into detail , much of which may be unknown to the viewer . one minor criticism : the participants let stanley lord of the californian off much too easily
dvd	the long long trailer is a good movie but too many girls is when lucy and desi were very young and thin but the movie too many girls is awful and forever darling is awful
dvd	dolph lundgren stars as a mercenary sent to kill a tribal leader and then him discovering the wrong of his nation , dull and just plain pointless ( and stupid ) action film suffers from inept action scenes and logic lapses . lundgren is imposing but ca n't act
dvd	some of the other reviews have said that the film is not editted properly and 'too slow ' . i 'm not a film-maker and can not comment on that other than to say that they are wrong . the film is amazing . i 'm not sure if there is any other movie or documentary that shows what a serialkiller-cum-dictator-cum-statesman is like . nowadays people might not know who idi amin is , or what he did , so its important to read up a little so you can truely appreciate this movie . he plays accordian ? you see him meeting with his 'advisors ' ( some of whom disappear so after . ) you see him play acting like a grown-up boy with toy soldiers . you see his self-appointed royal pedigree and send his support for nixon ! its fascinating and amazing . this is man that , self-proclaimed , actually ate some of his rivals ( not the whole body i hope ) . he killed many people directly and by his policies . his ego is outstanding and its an amazing movie . apparently , there is a new movies coming out about idi amin starring forrest whitaker . he 's a good actor and so i look forward to seeing it . but this is the real guy . its amazing and a feat probably never to happen again
dvd	as i stated before , i have a fabulous thing called `` digital cable '' . one night i was flippin through the channels and this movie was on . i could only watch so much of it before i had to turn it off because the voice dubbing was way off . sometimes that happens with `` digital cable '' , but it usually it will right itself in the end . as i watched for about a half an hour i could not take it anymore . i tried everything to fix it including switching channels , turning on and off the tv , and things of that nature . i even went as far as calling comcast and complaining , but even that was a wasted effort . i eventually had to turn it off because i was a hairs-width away from haymakering morris . well , even though comcast ruined my viewing experience so far , when i was at blockbuster i decided to give it another chance . i know i mentioned that the lead actor could not act but i thought i could look past this , because it might not be completely his fault . for one the visuals could be slightly off like the voices , or it might be because it 's his first movie . who knows but howard 's mind was made up . `` rumble in the bronx '' was to be rented . from what i saw so far on `` digital cable '' , i possibly found a person i could call my mentor , when i enter the world of stuntmen . when i returned home i threw the dvd in the dvd player and guess what ? the dvd was messed up as well , the voice dubbing was totally off key as it was on `` digital cable '' . i raced back to blockbusters and returned it and grabbed another copy , telling them this dvd was broken . i returned home again and tried to watch it . `` what the heck ! ? '' i yelled , `` is the world against howard tuttleman ! ? '' you guessed it that dvd was messed up as too . i even tried it out on another dvd player and it proved to me that the run of dvds blockbuster has were all messed up . i got so frustrated that i threw the dvd out the window ( i rented it on my father 's card so there is no recourse to me ) . after i cooled down alittle bit by blasting away on my harmonica , i was still determined to see this movie . i ran up to best buy in troy , and i found a copy . i asked the servant that was working in the movie section if this is the most updated and newest version , hoping that it was a new pressing . i was happy with his answer and purchased it . well i returned home and made up some popcorn and grabbed a pop . i put the dvd in the dvd player and dimmed the lights . finally , tuttleman will have his moment . well to keep this clean and short , let me say that , that night ended with a baseball bat , three ( 3 ) stitches in my hand , a broken window , and a hefty grounding-sentence ( we are talking weeks here ) . in conclusion , some movies ca n't be good , no matter how cool the stuntman , this movie should be pulled off the shelves because it could possibly start a riot . later .
dvd	the recent disappearance of spalding gray has made me realize what i do n't like about this film : its narcissism . it 's gray 's defining characteristic . after a while , despite jonathan demme 's fabulous direction ( he makes the best of a limited repertoire ) it just gets boring
dvd	another tired story about the blackman as the horrible villian and the blackwoman as the innocent victim ... and we wonder why our community has so many problems..maybe it 's because of attitudes that are based on fantasy like this film and some other films ... '' color purple '' , `` for colored girls ... . '' etc . we need to stop the finger pointing a realize that liberation can only occur if we `` work together '' ... that means blackmen and blackwomen..
dvd	spurlock decided to undertake an interesting experiment with his own health ; eat nothing but mcdonald 's fast food for 30 days . the result ; his health gets ruined . while spurlock 's experience is not exactly a scientific study you could publish in the lancet , it is a disturbing examination of what fast food and soft drink are doing to our health . i rarely eat mcdonalds ( though i enjoy the odd coke ) however the restaurant chain is quite popular in australia , as it is worldwide . the strength of mcdonalds and other fast food chains is obviously providing tasty food at low prices very quickly to the consumer . mcdonalds essentially applied the industrial technique of mass production to fast food , and made ray kroc ( its founder ) a fortune . i do n't really buy the line that multinational corporations are evil , because they are multinational corporations ; we have to remember corporations exist in relation to governments and ultimately consumers , as well as shareholders . we happily buy coke , mcdonalds , cigarettes , and many other things obviously bad for our health , and yet seem to like to blame the company which provides that addictive substance to us when our health goes bad . in our individualistic culture , we tend to all too readily avoid self-responsibility and the virtue of self-control , and in my view this is part of the reason fast food exists . however , the rocketing levels of obesity , especially amoung children , are of great concern , and it is clear the marketing techniques often aimed at children by fast food companies is at least unethical . we need to make sure the tide of obesity turns in the negative direction , otherwise this generation risks dying earlier than our parents and grandparents . spurlock 's experience is a warning to all of us to take the warnings on eating well and exercising seriously , and not ignoring them for the sake of self-indulgence
dvd	i can only imagine how painful it must of been to `` act '' in this film . after the first half hour it was like a train crash to watch . do anything you can to get out of sitting through this
dvd	this is the 2000 or so version of the dvd . this is identical with the vhs version , except it adds two features . the first is an excellent `` making of '' video from 1996 -- which was re-done with a different host for 2006 , but all the `` interview '' segments are the same . the second was a `` making of '' video done for the dvd , which does n't add a whole lot . were i to do it again , i 'd buy this version , and skip the 2006 `` 50th anniversary '' release . this is the classic chuck jones television `` grinch '' , in one of the best packages for it . and the `` horton hears a who '' is also a chuck jones classic . `` a person 's a person , no matter how small . ''
dvd	i 've been doing this dvd workout for two years , and i still ca n't make it all the way through the `` level 2 '' workouts . this video is incredibly challenging , but i like that i can do the `` level 1 '' workouts and have the goal of making it to the next level one day . no other dvd can accomplish what tamilee does in 15 minutes . this really makes me value how efficient she is at giving you exercises that are really challenging and in a short amount of time . i am always sore the next day when i do her workouts . this is a great dvd
dvd	somehow - this movie touched my heart and my mind - and i am sure if ben and matt could figure out exactly what their formula was they would do it everytime . however - it just may be one of those once in a lifetime things - like first love - impossible to re-capture , and in a sense , haunting . i am not obsessive in any way but i have watched this movie at least twenty times - with each time revealing another layer of meaning - and with the movie becoming a place where i sometimes go for comfort . the synergistic combination of outstanding actors in their best roles - maybe their best ever - in combination with simply a great story most definitely puts this movie in a special category - so buy it and watch it . you 'll be glad you did . mik
dvd	imagine someone combining the scripts for zardoz and independence day and letting a troupe of inebriated special education students control the acting and directing ... .then you would have battlefield earth . it is so bad it actually has some entertainment value which elevates it to two stars . you become mesmerized as you sit back and consider that this is the end result of john travolta putting his heart and soul into a project . just awful . if battlefield earth and pluto nash were humans they would deserve to be executed
dvd	i saw this movie and was shocked at the contents , considering that it was aimed at children . it starts out with the gypsy esmeralda doing a very provocative stripper style pole dance . while no stripping happened , there was n't much other difference in the style of dance . later in the movie , one of the men is obsessing over her in a manner i would never want my children to see . he sings a song about how she will burn in hell if he does n't have her , and meanwhile a vision of her provocative dancing is playing out in the flames of a fire . regardless of the rest of the movie , these two scenes make this highly innapropriate for children . not to mention that the story is very untrue to the novel , which had a tragic ending rather than a happy ever after one .
dvd	a movie to enjoy watching many times . very entertaining and light .
dvd	season 3 of the l-word is by far the best yet . the character development and story have come so far since the 1st season , and are even better than season 2 . they have scaled back the sex a little bit , but when they do put it in , the sparks really fly . i love the l-word
dvd	it 's an interesting approach at what people will do for money . still , i hated it . john travolta was terrible [ as usual ] . lisa kudrow , who was the reason i watched this , was so incredibly unlike her role on `` friends '' as she was a murderous goldigging nympho-biatch who made you mad every time she was on screen . i was very disappointed with her performance . i ca n't believe this hilarious comedic actress went for such a ... part . the other supporting actors were no good either with the exception of bill pullman , who was pretty funny as the `` i could give a damn about it '' cop . the best thing about this movie though , is the cute , gullible waitress named wendy who 's only on screen about five minutes throughout the entire film . anyway , skip this one . it was just plain awful
dvd	this movie is the worst movie i have ever seen ! complete waste of my time
dvd	this is a film like none other you have ever seen , and as such you 'll either love it , or hate it . from the `` reviews '' posted on amazon , i 've come to the conclusion that the people who hate it are simply people who do n't have the intelligence to have understood a word of it . this film is not literal . learn to *think* about what you are watching . to interpret archetypes , symbolism and metaphor . a clue : the lady character is named story . now why might that be ? and why would she require a vessel before taking flight into the world ? and what precisely does the wolf-like scrunt represent ? and why are there three of those monkeys ? this film is a love letter from one creative person to all other creatives in the world . if you are n't an artist , you probably wo n't get it at all , and might even post a scathing review of it on sites such as this . but that achieves nothing but illustrate how stupid you truly are to the artistic souls that will understand everything this film says , and love every beautiful , unique and visionary second of it . magical .

dvd	there are enough reviews of the main movie story so i do n't need to add anything in that regard . but , what on earth does a lesbian sub-story ( in both regards ) have to do with the story as a whole ? nothing . so , we have another movie that would be great to introduce the whole family to blue-grass music and the appalachian way of life that , instead , heads for the trash bin
dvd	watched like reading a comic book . so many murders for so little money . corpses never turned stink in the thailand humid and hot temperature . lousy acting , directing and totally stupid screenplay with twisted to the limit ridiculousness and impossibility . a story so bad that turned into a disturbing watch . boasted with awards and high praises for the primitiveness or roughness of the poor plot and scenario ? give me a break
dvd	plot summary : a man-without-a-memory found floating in the mediterranean sea searches for his identity , discovering along the way pieces to the puzzle that ultimately paint him as a highly-trained government assassin . reason for the rating : violence and some language . based on the robert ludlum-authored book by the same name , the bourne identity is part action flick , part stylized thriller . in his first role as an erstwhile action hero , matt damon shines as bourne , imbuing the character with both an appropriate edginess and a comfortable-in-his-own-skin-even-though-he-doesn't-know-who-he-is ease . as the story opens , bourne is pulled out of the mediterranean sea and treated for suspicious bullet wounds by the crew of an italian fishing boat . the `` hey , this is a story about espionage '' theme is introduced early as a crew member removes a tiny implant from bourne that displays what we later learn is a swiss bank account number . upon finding and opening the safe deposit box , bourne discovers multiple passports ( including one with the name jason bourne ) , a variety of foreign currency , and a gun . he then begins his search to uncover his true identity -- and until now , so does the audience . if there is one misstep in the bourne identity , it may be the fact that early scenes involving the cia and the agency 's frantic attempts to track him down give audience members the answer to bourne 's identity far earlier than bourne himself . at this point the film becomes more of a `` how will he survive ? '' thriller rather than a `` who am i ? '' mystery . a love interest of sorts ( played nicely by run lola run actress franka potente ) gives bourne a `` partner in crime '' to play off of for much of the movie , but her role seems more of a plot contrivance rather than a reasonable or logical plot development . an implied ( off-screen ) love scene for the two is just as implausible as it is brief , but does n't detract too much from the action . the most interesting ( and morally significant ) moment in the film comes when bourne finally remembers who he is as well as the mission he was on . through this pivotal flashback ( and some foreshadowing that finally makes sense ) , we learn that the highly-trained killing machine is n't capable of pulling the trigger upon seeing his assassination target 's children in the room with him . bourne 's hesitation nearly costs him his life and sets the course for the film 's premise as he is shot , falling into the mediterranean sea . smartly directed , the bourne identity is fast-paced without feeling rushed . the cinematographer paints the european setting in shades of grays and yellows , giving the movie a unique noir-like look that fits well with the drama . as an action film decorated with whodunit sensibilities , this film is a winner for older teens and adults . nappaland.com recommends : ignore the plot contrivances and just enjoy the ride -- the bourne identity is a worthy discovery . after the show ... if members of your family choose to view this movie , use these questions to spark discussion about it afterward : -- -what do you think prompted jason bourne to pause when he was preparing to shoot his assassination target on the yacht ? what does this say about bourne 's moral compass ? -- -how would you feel if you suddenly could n't remember who you were ? what actions would you take to discover your identity ? -- -when faced with the horror of who he really is and what he has done , jason bourne longs for a chance to erase his past and start his life anew . when have you felt that way ? how can a relationship with jesus give us a `` second chance '' in the truest sense ? s
dvd	jodie foster is excellent but there is no doubt that the daughter will be found on the plane at the end . the only mystery is in the details . no real suspense . i found the plot to be a little farfetched
dvd	i ordered this movie for my husband . he loves it ! it 's a funny entertaining movie and something you can watch over and over . no big plot - but it 's got it 's moments . i 'm quite sure there is something for every european to be offended by ... so keep a sense of humor and enjoy
dvd	avoid this cheapo release of these great film ! subpar prints..certainly not from original 35mm elements..wait for the good one to come out down the road
dvd	after having read the book and waiting in anticipation when it first came out , i was extremely disappointed . the movie very well could be alright on its own merits , but the books plot is very different and much more suspenseful
dvd	if you liked `` raise the red lantern '' or `` the last emperor '' , this is a perfect movie.gong li , who played a concubine fighting with others for her husband 's affection now plays a woman who realizes another man loves her husband . `` farewell my concubine '' uses chinese opera as a way of telling the story.i used to listen to a lot of chinese opera -- which is an acquired taste.this movie uses the story of a king beloved concubine 's self-sacrifice to frame the love story between two men.when one of the men falls in love with and marries a woman , the stage is set for a tragic love triangle.the final scenes are chilling , powerful.this is a spectacle not to be missed
dvd	for the time period when this was made , this was an excellent movie . made you stop and think , `` watch who you 're going to bed with '' !
dvd	this film is a perfect example of how straight action and big-name stars can not replace the necessity of well written drama . i will not give away the plot -- although that is admittedly hard to do since there is so little of it . basically clooney 's character mr . ocean , a career burgler , is released from prison with a plan to rob the vault of a las vegas casino . so he recruits 11 men , each with a talent to add to the operation . this is where the trouble begins . the viewer is given no reason at all why he should sympathize with any of these characters . there is almost no introduction to many of them , and barely even a mention of their names . literally half an hour into the film `` the eleven '' are assembled and they 're already robbing the casino . how 's that for plot development ? and that 's basically it ladies and gentlemen : go to vegas , rob casino , go home , movie over . some of the `` good guys '' are even outright repellant . our would-be heros ' enterprise is bankrolled by some greasy hollywood tycoon . am i supposed to like this fat weasel ? the only reason we are given to sympathize at all with at least mr . ocean , is that the guy he 's robbing , the casion owner , is a really bad guy . supposedly he has people killed 'n stuff . ( this actor played a bad guy in godfather part 3 ) . but we never see any real evil deeds . in fact , he just seems like a handsome , polite , very prosperous businessman . he manages to raise his voice for just one line in the entire film . mr . ocean on the other hand , and his cohorts , are career criminals . but the guy they 're robbing is an even greater criminal , you see . so that makes it ok. and really , if you were being robbed , would n't you want to be robbed by george clooney and brad pitt ? they 're such nice guys . that makes getting robbed fun . just a couple of nice guys stealing from another nice guy . how thrilling . this entire film is a rushed series of action sequences punctuated by a few soap opera moments with julia roberts . there are a few minor things going on in the backgroung , like a boxing match , which are essentially irrelevent . throughout there seems to be vital information missing ( like say , a plot ) . soderbergh simply did a terrible job of making me care what happens to clooney and roberts . this film is also horribly cut . several times what seemed like vital plot details were intoduced , and then completely forgotten about . take the scene where pitt and a buddy are casing out the joint and the casino 's owner makes an appearence . the folder he has just been handed , explains pitt , contains secret security codes . you would think that would be something important right ? you would think they will need to get those codes . well , wrong . in fact you wo n't hear or see a single thing more about them for the rest of the movie . they introduce what seems to be an important detail and then totally abandon it without any development . and that happens all the time in this movie . in fact mr . ocean 's team gets down the secure elevator shaft and into the vault with only minor difficulties . ( and boy , they started repelling down that shaft quick , did n't they ? you did n't even know they were robbing the place yet . wow , these guys are good . or maybe steven soderbergh is as over-rated as his film . ) they make it look easier than breaking into the safe at 7-eleven . this , after mr . ocean briefed his crew at the beginning on the nearly impregnable security measures the vault was supposed to have . one would hope this film would at least end strong . but soderburgh makes the final scene open ended in such a way as to leave the audience confused and disappointed . we are left wondering whether the `` eleven '' actually got away with their caper ... or worse . what a way to completely overturn the mood of a movie that at least had the merit of being light-hearted . the writer of the screenplay even said as much in the audio commentary to the dvd ! ( as did the actors in their commentary . ) probably the best moment on this dvd is hearing the screenwriter tell soderbergh to his face that he screwed up the ending . i am loath to give either 1 or 5 stars , since hardly anything is absolutely good or bad , but this film comes very close to 1 star . this is your standard artistically worthless hollywood product . it is big on budget , big on bling , and low on story . i suppose if you just feel like wasting some time , this is as good a way to do it as any . personally i would rather have a story with more substance
dvd	this is a great movie , especially if you like `` dancehall queen '' . paul campbell does a great job as capone and carl bradshaw is excellent as usual as the crime boss . while the story is somewhat generic it is still well worth watching
dvd	i bought this dvd becuase i really wanted to learn the dance moves in `` you got served '' and was extremely disappointed . the only routines they teach you are from the people who lost the dance battles in the movie and why you would want to learn those , i do n't know . the freestlye section at the end is fun to watch , but this is neither a good workout nor a good hip hop dance video
dvd	i discarded the dvd after watching it . if you do not want to have the impression of witchcraft in your home do n't buy this version of the secret garden .
dvd	my 14 month old son loves the baby einstein series . they 've been the only movies to hold his attention . the sounds and music get his attention , the shapes and colors hold it . that said , this movie never got or held his attention . there are no interesting sounds or music . the voices are very monotone . while i understand the intention of this video , if you do n't catch the attention of the child , what 's the worth in it ? the pictures on the screen do not corrolate well with what is being said . i also believe that there is value in learning not only foreign languages , but foreign cultures . if i knew what was being said when nursery rhymes or poems are recited , i could repeat them in english as an additional learning tool . all around , this move was disappointing
dvd	i did not like this dvd at all . it requires too many props such as bricks , belts , towels , blankets , chairs , etc ... each pose takes too long due to lengthy explanations . as a beginner i find this too boring and studio based and unable keep my attention . i feel it was a waste of money and do n't recommend it
dvd	this dvd is not shaolin idiot but an older film of stephen chow . it 's really a film called `` look out , officer '' that stephen chow made in 1990 . shaolin idiot is not out yet to my knowledge . if you want stephen chow 's `` look out , officer '' you should buy this dvd if not , do n't .
dvd	when i hear the alarm go off and the opening strains of henry mancini 's piano creep in , i know i 'm preparing for that journey into the best alcohol induced haze of the 80s on the `` crawford memorial interstate-81 '' . stops along the way include ... adoption wars birthday exploitation unfair life being let go rose rage raw ( rare ) steak one award taking that special exit for `` wire hanger etiquette '' christmas propaganda chadwick , love , and a snitch near death experience banishment making up soft drink wars loss new beginnings new losses last moments and last words before taking that final exit back to reality . in a world filled with `` f*** me '' heels , booze , domestic disputes and the biggest taboo of them all , `` wire hangers '' ... we all know she 's a movie star , she a bitch , she dresses well and she 's rich . ( quoting john waters ) i 've watched this so many times that i need therapy
dvd	highly acclaimed . that , i knew . i watched the first 30 minutes , which is 1/4 of the movie , before i decided to hang it up . new lady moves into a conservative french town and opens a chocolate shop . this upsets the local church , even before she begins unleashing secret desires and so forth with her sinful chocolate . okay . can you really carry 2 hours with this single plot ? nope . this one 's boring .
dvd	i do n't usually like these type of movies , but this is a ca n't miss ... you 'll laugh
dvd	ahh , `` iron eagle '' . a classic of the 1980 's golan-globus production mill . with the current spate of historic/ '' current '' military movies , it 's sometimes good to see how hollywood 's come in trying to get the details right . one ca n't do much better than using this flick as a baseline . in case you are n't already familiar with this gem , louis gosset jr. playing a reserve air force colonel , and a teenage kid fly a mission inside an unnamed arab country -ok i 'll name it : libya- to rescue the kid 's dad . pop gets shot-down when he 's intercepted in international waters , but the us refuses to do anything more than diplomatic pressure . the kid and lou gosset meet up when the kid 's challenged to race the local bully with his plane while the bully 's using his dirt bike . suffice it to say he wins and impresses his babe ; he does n't get his slot at the usaf academy , though . you got ta take the bad with good i guess . when the words on dad get back to the family , this kid uses his base `` network '' to get access to imagery , enemy air defense data , and two f16s carrying a b52 's worth of ordinance . all of this being done by his friends exploiting the dim bulbs who are their parents , no less . ( if only strike planning was this easy . ) of course , the kid has flown training missions with his dad , and has a boatload of simulator time , so he 's a natural to fly the mission . he convinces gosset to go along with him , and his two-ship is on the way . the flying scenes are nothing spectacular , with obviously israeli f16s playing the good guys , and kfirs ( modified mirages ) acting as migs . cockpit scenes are completely the imagination of the set designer ; i 'm guessing he never was anywhere near a real aircraft . these are especially dated now as many computer flight sims are pretty darn accurate in cockpit , flight , and combat models . anyway , lots of explosions on the way in , lou gets hit and aborts and our hero must press on alone-go figure . he manages to talk with the evil dictator directly and get his dad on the runway for him to land ( ! ) and pick him up . more silliness ensues as he launches weapons on the ground , taxi 's out and takesoff . he kills the bad guy and heads home to find lou punched out and was rescued . rather than the prison sentence for espionage , and theft of government property that lou , the kid , his pals and the idiots they exploited on base should 've got , he gets his slot at the air force academy . the end . overall , i guess lou 's performance was fairly good , but everyone else performed at the grade-b level this flick is . note especially a very young shawnee smith as one of the kid 's buds . worth seeing for laughs , and as a film version of a kid 's pilot fantasy .
dvd	the original csi series is fantastic because you figure out the crimes by finding the evidence . this series uses the csi name without the investigating that makes the original so good . it is mainly a mellow-drama surrounding the lives of the characters . some people will like the drama the writers have put togethor , but there 's no mystery
dvd	joe versus the volcano is a rare blend of comedy and insight that 's romantic enough for girls , funny enough for guys , with effective visual symbolism , and appropriate for the whole family . maybe it could be described as an allegory for escaping the drudgery of life , or something like that , but at any rate it 's pleasant to watch , at times profound , at other times funny . the beginning 3rd is about joe ( tom hanks ) struggling with hypochondria and a lousy , really crummy job , primarily because of the dreary work environment and the typical ( oppressive ) supervisor ( dan hedaya ) . ( i 've been there myself , when i worked at pines mfg h tooling and again at toro , where everyone was on dope . ) joe learns from his doctor ( robert stack , of the untouchables ) that he has a `` brain cloud '' and only a few months to live . the tone of the movie rises as joe quits his job and we feel like impending death is the best thing that 's ever happened to him . he takes a former co-worker ( meg ryan ) to dinner and seems to wake up to life for the first time . the next day billionaire lloyd bridges ( airplane ) enters joe 's life with a bizarre proposition : since he 's dying anyway , why not literally jump into a volcano - for the billionaire 's own financial motive - and live it up with unlimited credit at the his expense in the meantime . joe accepts and in his journey to the volcanic island learns about how to live life from helpful chauffeur ossie davis ( the client ) and the billionaire 's two daughters - both played by meg ryan ( sleepless in seattle ) , which makes a total of 3 roles for her in this great movie , making it even more pleasant to watch
dvd	i was expecting to see a decent film by bava , but after having seen about 5 of his films , i can only guess that is he is a very good stylist but he lacks the capability to engage us with a story or to even scare us . most of his films are gorgeous to behold but they are vapid and have no story , this film is just like all the rest . there is no point to any of it , there is no plot and hardly any suspense , suffice it to say it might be interesting for a 12 year old horror goof but to an adult , its quite tedious . chris lee is rather banal also , he does n't do much and it seems that he dubbed his own voice in the studio , most of the cast is rather dull also , supposedly playing some ancient noble family , they look more like 1960 's mop heads and morons who were on too much acid . the dialogue , what there is , is crude , probably written by a drunk italian because there are so many mistakes , one example was when lee was whipping the lady on the beach and she says , `` i ca n't have more ice cream ! '' so , i would suggest renting `` planet of the vampires '' because that is more enjoyable than this waste . interesting character to note was `` lesmo '' , dubbed as the `` european peter lorre '' who does n't have much in the way of presence or acting skills and he looks like a cross between a frog and a midget .
dvd	i just finished watching das boot . to even draw comparisons between these two movies is absolutely ridiculous . where das boot is a gripping human tale of the tragedy of war , u-571 is just more hollywood tripe . if you just want 'splosions and escapism , i guess u-571 does the trick . if you want a realistic sub movie that will haunt you for many nights to come , go with das boot
dvd	if lifetime switched from showing crappy dramas about wronged women to showing crappy horror flicks about wronged women this would one of them . this movie was not scary . it would have been suspenseful if i cared for any of the characters . you know what the best part was ? when it was over . few movies compel me to write reviews , good or bad . this one obviously did
dvd	heavens harps and wings are nice , but what a showman extraordinaire florenz zigfeld jr. ( 1869-1932 ) wants most now when hes no longer on earth is to put on another extravaganza . it would have the brightest stars and creative talents . the most in glamour , gams and optimism , in short it would be like ziegfeld follies . with a whos who of credited and uncredited hollywood talents , this all-star revue is heaven to fans of musicals . fred astaire ( 1899-1987 ) dazzle once , twice..four numbers in all . red skelton ( 1913-1997 ) reprises his funny guzzlers gin skit . esther williams ( 1922 - ) swims , lena horne ( 1917 - ) sings and judy garland ( 1922 -1969 ) spoofs snobbery , theres verdi ( giuseppe f. verdi 1813-1901 ) opera and fanny brice ( 1891-1951 ) vauderville . patter and pantomine , and `` the babbit and the bromhilde '' with gene kelly ( 1913-1997 ) joining fred astaire in their first-ever screen pairing what a show ! the man called flo must be proud . high quality transfer . features not remastred . recommende
dvd	okay , the rating above is not going to be liked but i have to be truthful . the only good thing going for this movie was the return of `` snake plissken '' . this film 's plot was essentially a rehash of the original `` escape from new york '' ... a bit more special effects ( which in fact , did not make this a better movie ) ... when i go to a sequel i expect to get what i paid for a totally new adventure with the same character / characters . kurt russell 's character is older and even more in the know of what the rewards are before he is offered them . obviously the movie does n't really know where it 's going as it takes two scenes ( 15 minutes of the film ) ( 1st scene - president , commandant , and lackey give snake the mission ) ( 2nd scene - commandant and lackey brief snake before he leaves for the mission ) to explan to the audience what 's the basic conflict . i guess either carpenter or russell are just getting too old to take a great leap and recount either an earlier snake plissken adventure or an adventure well worth telling.. i also wish to comment that this disc has no special features besides a movie trailer ... `` carpenter ... .russell ! `` please do n't tell me `` money '' caused you to revisit a `` cult figure '' ! some redeeming qualities are the acting performances of cliff robertson , stacy keach , steve buscemi , and pam grier . robertson , keach , and grier may be old but they can sure make you believe in their characters ! sorry , snake ... . '' i do n't love l.a. '' the-big-green-pointy-eared-one !
dvd	i loved `` the rm '' and expected the same level out of this movie , but my husband 's whole family agreed to turn it off during the bathroom scene and never watched the rest . the teenagers did n't even want to check it out after that scene . they also loved `` the rm '' . if you can get it from the library go ahead , but do n't spend money on it
dvd	i was expecting more because of the history on these tapes/dvd 's . this one was disappointing as you do n't feel like you did a workout . i like the older ones better with tammy
dvd	`` panic room '' is a great thriller- jodie foster 's return to the big screen . i 'd assume most people would enjoy the film itself . however , the real treat in the 3-disc special edition is the behind-the-scenes footage explaining the wondeful camera work and production in the film . any movie lover will be blown away by the creativity and the vision the director brings to this picture
dvd	i absolutely loved this dvd . i saw in on tv , but wanted a permanent edition for my 'supes ' collection . i highly recommend it for anyone interested in the history of superman , its origins and where he fits into our culture today . it 's great
dvd	first , i thought i bought it for my great old days . but it 's not . i really love it , and i ca n't stand watch it and watch it again ... ! ! hi studio , would you please release the 2nd season ! ! almost 2 years waiting ? o..come o
dvd	this is a great show and very entertaining . the story is n't the greek classic , but it 's a fine riff on it . the songs are good , and they grow on you as you watch . i take issue with the reviewer who thought there was gratuitous sexuality in the meg character - it 's just a cartoon , for pete 's sake . like some other reviewers , i was also annoyed with michael bolton singing `` go the distance '' over the end credits , but this dvd has a music video of the spanish language version , `` no importa la distancia , '' sung by ricky martin , and it is killer ! this one is well worth the money
dvd	reference picture quality on hd-dvd . basically unwatchable though . i would not recommend the blind buy on this one .
dvd	this movie is very simple , and unique . it 's the kind of love story which you really believe in while you 're watching because it does n't feel phony . this can be credited to the acting , the situation , and the plot as well . this is n't about a man falling madly in love with a beautiful woman and then spending his life missing her . that 's all been done , and that 's what makes this film a breath of fresh air . river phoenix shows why he is missed by so many , and really allows you to connect with his character . i recomend this to anyone who wants to see love put to true art , and be touched at the same time
dvd	the firms `` super body sculpt '' is a 40 mins , 3 parts workout which is broken up into upper body , lower body , and abs . each segment has its own warmup and cool down . it can be performed one segment at a time , or all together for a complete total body workout . the upper body flies by quickly with pushups , lat rows and french presses and biceps . the lower body section focuses a little too much on squats , and by the end of your last leg press exercise , there are more squats that will make you want to scream `` enough '' . i found the abs section too short and not enough emphasis on crunches , and too much on obliques . the stablization exercises are a great bonus to this dvd , and are my favourite . overall it is very well instructed . you can pyramid up the weights if you are strong enough , especcially during leg presses and squats . i usually do all three segments to get the full benefits i need , and this dvd is great as a beginners tool to a firm body
dvd	this was not the entire version of the hbo special . i was disappointed because some of my favorite parts were missing from this dvd . if i had known it was n't the entire show i would n't have bought it
dvd	holly played by kristen miller ( she spies , man of the year ) has a nice career as a journalist with her friend played by brooke burns ( baywatch , death of the supermodels ) . the 2 of them fight over the owner of a restaurant named zucas ( i think thats close enough ) runned by actor tod babcock ( guard dogs , poor white trash ) . when holly gets pissed off at her friend because she slept with mr. babcock she tries to find a new place to live and low and behold she finds a new shy roommate tess , played by allison lange ( the hillside strangler , roswell ) . holly becomes close to tess and they seem to hit it off real well , until holly finds out some things about tess that makes her think that maybe this wasnt such a good idea . well , in 1992 , jennifer jason leigh did this to bridget fonda and now they make a sequel about it , wow , they must of went threw tons of scripts just to get to this one . pretty much the young girls on screen are eye candy and the acting is pretty bad plus the twists and thrills arent that great . this can go down with basic instinct 2 ... .in the trash can or the skeet shoot , one of the two . also starring francois giroday ( carpool guy , framed ) , tracey mccall ( not another teen movie , second degree ) , rif hutton ( osmosis jones , halfway decent ) and kyme ( school daze , geppetto ) .
dvd	the fridays gang steals some diamonds . mike epps is not chris tucker no matter how hard he tries to be . his constant whinning is enough to ride my last nerve . plus , everything about the movie is just campy and just wholly unbelieveable that i do n't know where to begin . whatever you do do n't buy or rent this garbage-wait to catch it on tbs or something
dvd	a good dozen years before his spectacular films of the late 70 's and mid 80 's allen got his name on the directorial map w/ this piece of fluff . you got ta start somewhere . tiger lily is more of a dry run for his later , real comedies than an original film in its own right . allen 's early work does tend to be stand up material thinly disguised as film . many of the jokes are funny but the one note premise wears thin quick . a must for allen enthusiasts and people who like quirky cultish so-bad-they're-fun movies
dvd	one of the most compelling events of the release of kenneth lonergan 's you can count on me is that it gave visibility to mark ruffalo who plays a troubled young man who , unable to deal with the childhood trauma of having lost his parents to a car crash , lives of life of unattached agony and isolation . he 's a loner and a drifter , medicating his self-pity with pot and short-lived relationships . his sister sammy , played wonderfully by laura linney , reacts to the same tragedy by being , in many ways , an overresponsible overcontrolling super mom . two opposite reactions to the same tragedy of course result in a sibling clash . this film shows with great complexity and biting comic insight , the attempt of this brother and sister to shed their defense mechanisms and most importantly reconnect with one another . the ride is never easy in this film . no easy answers are given . just as important , this film , which deals with the pain of loss , never descends into the maudlin hallmark movie sap that other films would . balancing edgy humor and profound psychological insight , lonergan has written and directed a tale that captures the layers upon layers of psychological complexity that accompany the trauma of loss . amazingly , he does it in a fast-paced film with scenes that are by turns comic and dramatic . matthew broderick , for example , plays a hilarious role of sammy 's neurotic anal-retentive boss at the bank . the conflict between him and sammy leads to a plot point that i 'll let you discover in the film . but most of all , this film shines because mark ruffalo plays such an endearing , sympathetic , sometimes infuriating character . you wo n't forget him
dvd	this was my first yoga cd and i found it amazing ... i 'm addicted to it . i still cant tell whether its challenging for advanced yogis but as a beginner i really enjoyed it ... . it does not have all that gibberish spiritual blab on one extreme nor power yoga that seems to really be pseudoyoga on the other extreme .. however this cd is just clear and to the point with good instruction excellent demonstration and fantastic sound tracks ... . eric 's voice is soothing the instructions are clear and the crew is great . the length is convenient 45 minutes and music is hypnotic . the more i use it the more i feel stronger increase flexibility , breathe more calmly and improve my posture.. in other words dont hesitate just get it ! ! ! ! !
dvd	i had the complete opposite experience with this workout than did the previous reviewer . the combination of doing upper and lower body exercises simultaneously caused my heartrate to soar which caused symptoms of overtraining . many people love this video but i just had a bad experience with it
dvd	way too expensive for a low quality product . the clarity of the picture is poor . there is not enough content to justify the price . i do n't recommend it at all . i feel i 've been cheated
dvd	well , this was about as formulaically politically correct as a movie can get , unfortunately : the female teenage protagonist ( played by witherspoon , whose acting powers have increased dramatically since her stilted acting here ) acts masculine and heroic , the male teenage protagonist acts craven and flippant . at one ridiculous point , the girl runs around acting like a commando , a veritable one-gal army , blowing up the bad guys , while the boy hides in a cave sniveling . later , when the boy tries to assert himself by offering to carry the gal 's backpack as they cross a desert , the gal snaps at him , bella abzug-style , and walks quickly ahead , leaving him in the dust . clearly a modern radical feminist thing going on here , and what is most unfortunate is that this movie was made for a young audience and therefore is in keeping with the modern radical feminist propaganda which is brainwashing young women into unnaturally behaving like men . of course , in the real world , the result for such manly girls , once they become women , is that men do not choose them and they remain alone , and therefore become bitter -- ironically and inevitably blaming men , of course . in this movie , the wimpy teenage guy falls for the brassy , masculine gal -- but that 's why they call them movies . when are these post-modern writers , artists , and other culture-shapers with an agenda going to realize that when they tout modern radical feminism , they are touting something unnatural -- men simply do not prefer masculine females . men want someone to complement them , not compete with them . men crave femininity in females , not feminism . wow , is there ever a difference in those two forms of comportment ! this poor teenage guy depicted in this movie , at least his character does progress a little bit : by the end of the movie , instead of craven and flippant , he graduates to something akin to a metrosexual-type with a wild-boy haircut , if that is even a step upward . but the plucky gal -- she 's still the one in charge in this fictitious world of upside-down gender relations . uh , another problem with this movie -- and there are many -- is when the kids are going through the kalahari desert , something which should be , and for a time is here depicted as , a foreboding and life-threatening task . yet we see witherspoon in this desert frolicking with a dog ; and we see the boy 's flippancy and joviality emerge in a totally out-of-place manner , considering the dire situation they are in . the sense of urgency which had been built up is totally excreted away by these light-hearted , inane scenes . look , i dig disney kid movies -- more realistic ones . you know , old style disney movies . you take `` old yeller '' for example . now there was a quality kid movie , and quite true to life . this movie was not . it had a plastic , spoiled-american-materialistic-teenybopper feel throughout . disney has gone down the tubes . in any number of ways , they 've been subverted by radical marxist agendas ( note : one more of these was the fact that an african bushman was allowed to evince a pagan ritual from his pc pagan religion -- something called `` tapping , '' while the caucasians were of course not shown evincing any sign of their un-pc judeo-christian religion -- this is bias , folks , leftwing , pc bias , same as the aforementioned feminist bilge ) . i am learning to run , not walk , away from disney stuff , and this movie was further cause for me to do so .
dvd	clearly this movie was never intended as high art , or even a zombie gore fest , although hyped as such , so it`s probably a bit unfair and easy to take shots at it , however i think it fails on it own terms . *** many spoilers to follow *** stop here if you plan to view the entire film . the premise : a group of stupid eco terrorists raid a research facility in london , even though warned by a researcher , release some highly agitated but otherwise normal looking chimps who then attack and infect them with a fast acting ( within seconds ) virus that transforms them into insane , red-eyed murderous really fast creatures who attack and infect other normal humans through bites and even scratches . one drop of their saliva or blood can infect you . the plague is let lose ... the hero : cut to a skinny kid of about 110 pounds with a dopey beard laying naked on a hospital bed , it`s 28 days later and he wakes up , but no one 's there . he then wanders around an empty london , in hospital scrubs , looking confused , yelling `` hello ! ! `` , `` hello ! ! `` there are no bodies outside , and nothing that looks like the remains of one . there are almost 15 million people in metropolitan london . where did they go i asked myself ? the supporting cast : he then wanders into a church , and finds it full of what looks like sleeping people , he yells `` hello ! ! `` at which time some start screaming and rush at him , in the close-up it`s clear they have turned and he slugs the creature-priest thing with his bag of coke cans . he gets out , more stuff happens , eventually he meets smart and tough selena ( naomie harris ) armed with a matchete and mark ( noah huntley ) , armed with a steel bar , who have avoided infection and explain the situation to the dim whitted hero , who turns out to be a bicycle messager boy who lives with mum and dad . seems the creatures come out mostly at night . mostly . hero insists on going home , mark selena tag along . we find his very middle class mum dad peacefully dead in bed from an overdose of booze and pills . guess they could not live in a world without telly ... more talk and moaning and tears from hero who very unwisely lights a candle at night which naturally draws an attack by some nasties , more fighting , bad guys are killed by selena and mark while hero cowers on floor . mark gets infected , denies it , but is chopped by selena who `` can see it in his eyes `` . damm girl ! if i`m ever in a zombie movie i want you along ! day 2 comes , the pair then wander aimlessly though london chatting away about everything but how to deal with the threat and survival and at this point i start thinking ; wouldn`t it be a good idea to get some guns ? preferably full auto , with a lot of ammo . i mean , although the creatures are fast , they are stupid , don`t run in packs and make a lot of noise and can be killed and stay dead . police stations and military bases are all over london , probably deserted , and filled with guns ... .but this doesn`t seem to occur to our wandering charactors who trust to a baseball bat machette which you must get close to use ... .emmmm . i start squirming a bit in the seat , and for the first time look at my watch , but it`s still kind of ok . so far , it`s still a tight , well made interesting film , with the bloody action well filmed and important to the story line , and mostly believeable in it`s own low buget post apocolypitcal setting with taut dialoge that holds my interest . maybe there a reason the hero is cast as stupid , or will he grow and learn through experience ? , maybe , but it better be soon because we are almost 30 minitues into the film , and it`s getting real hard to identify with him . or care . the suporting cast 2 : night falls . our pair see flashing lights on the top of a high rise , much action ensues , they find more survivors , just a average working type dad taxi driver and his young daughter . more talk , seems they are out of water and there is a radio broadcast giving direction to go north where the army ( who usually have guns ) has set up a secure area . works for me . after some debate on whether it better to stay where they are , isolated , in fact trapped on top of a building , with no water or power or food or real weapons until overrun by zombies , or travel north to safety , in daylight and safety ( remember , the monsters don`t operate in daylight ) this group of dopes reluctantaly decide to go north , in a taxi , with no guns.. ( remember rule # 3 of zombie films : gun are good ) ..and at this point in time this heretofore good film starts to move rapidly downhill in believablity . the journey of the dumb : piling into dad`s hack , loaded with junk as if going on a brighton holiday , with all , even tough selena giggling and laughing , off they go . when faced with the choice of driving through a dark tunnel , where it is obvious that they could be trapped and killed , or another safer route , they naturally chose the tunnel . stuff happens . stopping to get gas , the hero wanders alone into a dark , confined space for no real reason , armed only with a baseball bat . more stuff happens . stopping for the night , they decide that a picturesque , open field with a few low stones is a great spot and preceed to ... ... you guessed it ! start a really big fire and go to sleep with no one on guard . i`m not making this up folks.. ! ! nothing happens . however they do get to see a family of white and black horses running free , and it`s clear that we are no longer watching a horror / action film , with some internal logic but a trite `` message film `` . they reach the army blockade , but no one is there , in spite of dead everywhere , they proceed to split up and wander around this perfect ambush site for a look see . more stuff happens . after this , the stupid illogical stuff comes fast so this is a good stopping point . at the end we learn from the crazy and sadistic army major ( aren`t they all though ) that the goon`s can`t farm or feed and will likely starve because of it . think about that one . we also learn that the virus is contact borne , not airborne , think hard about that one dudes ! since it started in one local it`s very unlikly to have spread thoughout england in 28 days ... .big plot holes , dumb ending , 110 pound stupid hero becomes arnold the terminator in 10 mintues . girls decide it`s far better to die a gruesom death then put out and lose their honor to what looks like a bunch of boy scouts in cammos , who are their only protection ... really dumb stuff after an excellent start . sad ... .this was a really superior film for the first 20 mintues .
dvd	i enjoyed francis veber 's 'the closet ' - released in france in 2001 - for two reasons . first , it features an all-star ensemble of french acting , certainly a tribute to veber 's skill as a director . just take a gander at the first six names to appear on the imdb credits : daniel auteuil ... . françois pignon gérard depardieu ... . félix santini thierry lhermitte ... . guillaume michèle laroque ... . mlle bertrand michel aumont ... . belone , the neighbour jean rochefort ... . kopel , the director imagine a movie where the great jean rochefort gets slotted sixth . each of these six stars can carry a movie in france on their own back . the fact that the group has teamed here is a testament to veber 's reputation . his previous release , 1998 's 'the dinner game , ' was lauded far and wide as a comedic masterpiece . actors get attracted to that type of skill . the second reason i got a kick out of watching 'the closet ' : i just learned that 'bend it like beckham ' writing partners gurinder chadha and paul mayeda berges are prepping a uk re-make for the screen for a targeted 2006 release , with chadha at the helm . her keen eye for comedy tinged with poignancy was confirmed by beckham 's runaway success , so i feel like i 'm in on a really great secret knowing she 's working on a re-make .
dvd	this video was not animated like the classic chuck jones features such as `` the cat in the hat '' and `` the grinch '' . my daughter was rather disappointed to see the camera scanning over pages of the books she already owns along with paper cutouts of the characters floating around as a cheap replacement for animation . we give this video a thumbs down
dvd	this film is visually stunning and impressive , and has talented and credible actors . unfortunately , there is barely a story with a lot of poorly-developed characters who are `` trained '' /brainwashed and instructed in the ways of death and inhumanity . the settings and group `` sermons '' from nazi officials are striking and convincing , but there is nothing that ties it all together . our hero fails to strike the `` killer blow '' and is stripped , literally and figuratively , of all status and walks away . the end . i 'm forced to comment that this is marketed as a gay film , and i was surprised by how un-gay it was . in fact , the two boy `` friends '' work together at one point to spy on a lady in a state of undress . it 's more about a childhood relationship in the midst of chaos than anything else . i have issues with some of the pacing as well . i found myself pressing the fast forward button several times , and did n't really seem to miss much . not a good sign . so , for what it is , it 's okay . certainly not a masterpiece , and certainly not something to run out and buy .
dvd	.. with an all-star cast . the plot is not new ( stage door , how to marry a millionaire and valley of the dolls to mention but a few ) , but judy , hedy and lana do an admirable job . never mind highbrow critcs ; hedy lamarr wasn`t that bad and lana does one of her best acting jobs ever . judy is a tomboy and it`s sad that life eventually took her into the direction of lana`s character sheila . the musical numbers are good , but sadly ; footage from the great ziegfeld are edited in ( note the finale ) . james stewart are good as well - as are edvard everett horton , charles winninger and eve arden . the film is filled with good 1-liners and there are even echoes of garbo`s first sound-entrance in anna christie
dvd	with the straight story , lynch demonstrated none of the recognizable trademarks that transformed him into the director that i love . this film felt like a `` blind date '' gone bad . the straight story showed up , david lynch arrived , but the rest of the date felt muddled , confusing , and utterly disastrous . everything in this film seemed wrong . lynch 's choice for lead actor , the bland sissy spacek , the filler of repeat cornfield montages , all the way to the incoherent time spent on the read , i just felt that nobody had control over this picture , yet the randomness ( and the possible tear ending ) gave critics something to smile about . this is not a david lynch film , and for those walking into this with images of mulholland drive , twin peaks , or even eraserhead in their mind will be utterly discombobulated . the straight story attempted to show us a slice of americana via the cornfields of iowa , but for this boy based in the flatlands of illinois , it just seemed repetitive and boring . what initially pulled me away from this film was the technique that lynch used to introduce us to alvin and his daughter rose . alvin lying on the ground because he ca n't get up , the cliché use of taking him to the doctor letting us know that he is deteriorating , while bringing us the central conflict of his brother falling ill was just too much in such a little time frame . spacek 's depiction of rose seemed unbalanced and rather stale . she brought nothing fresh to this rather emotional character outside of a stutter and some unfunny scenes . i expected so much more from spacek with her timeline of cinema , but this felt like something she did on an afternoon instead of providing us with the intensity that she harbors . then , to add more fuel to the fire , there was richard farnsworth . again , he is n't a horrible actor , but it felt like lynch picked him because he fit the role physically , but alas , could n't master it mentally . farnsworth seemed out in left field for a majority of his time onscreen . i could n't tell if he was trying to remember his lines or if he was truly in character . his eyes seemed watery for everything which brought too much emotion to those little scenes , and seemed to bring not enough by the dramatic ending . his entire speech about his time overseas at war was pathetic , while some will quote it as being his speech of a lifetime , i saw it as babble ( and no , i am not that insensitive - i just felt it could have been handled by a stronger , more professional actor ) . the rest of the cast seemed equally as unimportant . i wanted lynch to either go 100 % for this film or none at all , but alas , it felt as if he just half-ed his way through this heap . speaking of david lynch , where did he go in this film ? there were some scenes that i witnessed that screamed the director that i love , but then there were others that just felt like he took pointers from ken burns ' `` looking at america '' class . i hated the sweeping cornfields that seem to plague this film . instead of keeping us by alvin 's side throughout his journey , lynch gave us a repetitive view of farming and corn . there is nothing wrong with this technique when making the epic that one desperately needs to see once in a while , but when the same images were used over and over again , i nearly felt lynch was humoring us with the dulls of iowa instead of being the majestic all the critics raved about . i think he could have been stronger with his filler than what he was with this film . he needed something to couple with the authenticity of alvin , but the stock-footage that he chose to show was definitely not the balance one could hope for . i also felt there was more to be discussed with the friends that he met along the way . alvin was a walking storybook , filled with the way that he led his own life instead of listening to those around him and learning from their experiences as well . lynch made alvin very closed minded , which did not create a strong protagonist for the feature . alvin was a strong character , but i needed more with this story . i wanted him to make choices , learn new things , and bring that to his brother 's table when they eventually met . i felt cheated when this never occurred and felt as if lynch was saying that this journey through americana was that we could learn from alvin , and not vice-versa . overall , i was n't stunned by this picture . i thought lynch could have been stronger with his choice of direction and cast instead of what seemed like he just `` played it safe '' . the overplayed stock footage of cornfields infuriated me due to the lack of time that we could have been spending with alvin . speaking of alvin , why could n't he have been a stronger , better-rounded character ? i felt after watching this film that lynch had duped me into believing that he wanted to paint a picture of america , but instead gave us nothing more than soft music , recycled images , and stock characters . the stories were interesting to listen to , but brought nothing fresh to the table . i must admit that the brotherly love moment brought a tear to my eye ( since i have a brother as well ) , but why could n't we focus on this further . lynch made the riff between the two brothers seem like a toss in the pan , when it was the central focus of this film . the straight story could have been a strong tale bringing in a new image for lynch , but instead it felt jagged and old . i could suggest one viewing for this film , any further , and you will see how dull those cornfields really claim to be ! grade : ** out of ****
dvd	one of the warmest , most pleasantly lip-smacking film 's ever ! made by a guy with a super-sized heart , america is a joyous celebration of the burger , and the down-home folks who create some of the most wonderfully odd versions of it . take it from someone who has the hamburger america poster hanging up - this little treasure is a home library essential
dvd	yes . wild things is what i recommend for our jaded eyes . are n't we sick of all the crowd pleasing pg-13 shows which are neither sexy or action packed - most of all with hardly a plot ? wild things is sex sex sex but with witty capital h humor and a twisted story . recent eye candy shows could learn a thing or two from this film . candy can remain sweet and sickening but a great script and a good cast ( from oscar nominee matt dillon , kevin bacon etc ) can turn candy into cuisine
dvd	in the days of the arcades there was a good movie that came out ( and funny enough had a great arcade game ) called krull . now mind you , i really had no idea what this movie was all about before i saw it ( when i was a whole bunch younger ) just saw the 5 bladed `` glaive '' and was sold but now as an adult i find i still like this movie and it reminds me of a true dungeons and dragons style adventure then almost any other movie ( including those terrible scifi d movies ugh ) it starts off with a prince and of course a princess yes been done before many many times but then in come the slayers and from then on its a totally different experience . with such ultimate favorites as the emerald seer , the widow of the web and the cyclops and of course the shapeshifting ( a bit daft too ) wizard with some very strange habits ( i dare not tell you so as not to ruin it ) but this is a classic movie and it will be good for generations to come . pros : cool effects ( for the time ) good story well done plot and themes cons : may be a bit too old for some and not flashy enough . but remember it is a tad old . its a 5 star easily some may not agree but judge the movie on its merits and not against those of today and anyone can see the care and detail that made this movie great
dvd	between the amended `` politically correct '' ending to this famous tale and the so-very-hokey interaction between kirstey alley and lloyd bridges , i could n't wait for this to be over ! the animation was very poor quality ... the music was not the focus , my grandchildren lost interest . shat else could possibly have been wrong
dvd	ok , check it out , there 's two jack blacks . one is the guy from tenacious d , you see him all the time . he 's funny and childish and insane . then there 's the other jack black . he 's the evil creature who pervades films like shallow hal and king kong , whose only humorous lines are the ones that are funny by accident . well , as long as you are n't fat and do n't feel patronized by gweneth presuming to know what it 's like not to be desired all her life ( ha ) , then by all means suspend all disbelief , logic , and brain power and watch this dumb movie . gweneth 's fat suit is actually pretty convincing , although most of the movie she 's played by an actual fat chick ... who by the way should have just been left in , without the whole `` ha ha the dude thinks she 's skinny '' nonsense . obviously , a film about a dude trying to cope with dating a big girl would have a lot more resonance if : a ) he were n't brainwashed b ) his fat girlfriend was n't replaced by a twiggy blond chick c ) the movie did n't throw ridiculous concepts your way ( like a guy could have sex with a 300 lb woman without realizing it ) d ) tony robbins was in no way involved whatsoever i knew i was slumming it when i saw this movie . but i 'm not sure what the message of this film is . jack black 's character is decent , considerate , great with kids and perfect in every way . oh , except he 's really shallow for no dicernable reason , other than his dad 's dying words were for him to go out and chase tail . the weird part is that hal 's not a bad person . the movie beats you over the head showing you he 's the nicest guy on on the face of the earth , so you ca n't really laugh at him looking like an idiot . rosemary is so fat she has superpowers . her butt actually creates typhoons ( i wonder if that has military applications ? ) . suddenly , hal mistakes ugly pimply girls for supermodels and evil skanks for old shrews . tony robbins brainwashed him , the fiend ! when hal finally realizes this he decides to ( ooh big spoiler ) love rosemary anyway , and learns a valuble lesson . along the way there are a ton of cliches like people thinking he 's dating rosemary just because her dad happens to be his boss , and a sexy neighbor in his building who starts to get the hots for him when she sees how non-judgemental he is dating a fat girl ( 'cause that would make any woman melt ) . of course there 's requisite best friend , played by jason alexander , who is repulsed by fat people and plots to get hal to dump her . then again , the friend is a complete troll , so i do n't know why hal would want him around . and to insult us further , they force some burned kids on us at the hospital to strike a serious note about how true beauty is on the inside . too ... many ... public ... service ... messages ! pick ... one.. ! ! but brain-dead writing aside , paltrow really sells her performance when they actually show her in the fat suit ( despite gweneth 's postering when this film was first released ) . regardless of its clumsy benevolence , i have to rate this as a romantic comedy . and for that , i give it a rating of totally unremarkable . nice gesture , farelly brothers . not to be bothered with
dvd	this movie captures faithfully what is in my imagination when i read the book . even though it was made several years ago , it 's still a fantastic movie . timeless
dvd	absolute junk , one of the worst films i have seen . you will be doing well just to stay awake for the duration
dvd	`` venom `` is one of those movies i thought i would hate because i heard so much negativity about it but i really enjoyed it , being a fan of the 70 's and 80 's slashers i crave newer versions because i have seen all the other ones over and over again . venom did not disappoint me . it starts off with action and never lets up.i found it to be one of my favorite new horror/slasher flicks , the voodoo angle was good but not overplayed , i 'm simple in that i want to see a killer with an axe , machete butcher knife etc not a bunch of supernatural mumbo jumbo..i do n't want to have to wonder '' was that a dream or was it real~ ! ! '' as so many movies these days play off of . give me an old fashioned slice and dice and i 'm in heaven.and venom gave me that , so i hope to see venom 2 , if so , i 'm there ( for the record , mr jangles used the hook chain before kane in see no evil ... ) ..
dvd	this is the 6th and last entry in the series lone wolf cub . this one not only has a different director than kenji , who directed 4 of the others , this is the entry most like a comic-book ( the series is based on a famous comic book series ) . not that that is bad . the whole series fluctuated between great period detail , serious themes , and not taking itself too seriously . it was at once graphic and fantastic , realistic and wildly improbable , factual and imaginary . serious silly . that 's what made it so damn interesting . throughout the series the action has taken place in different locales and landscapes of japan . tracing actual historical roads and cities . now we end the series in the mountains and the snow , the white heaven in hell of the title . this entry has a lot of stuff going on : lord retsudo of the hated yagyu clan , ogami 's arch enemy , sends his last child , a daughter to do in ogami with her `` falling dagger '' technique . when , predictably , she fails , he goes to an illegitimate son that was abandoned and raised by a mountain tribe . the downhill ski battle may not be quite as intense and exciting as the one in her majesties secret service , but it ai n't bad . that ogami 's baby cart guns never seem to need reloading etc . are minor quibbles . if ogami does n't shoot em he always seems able to bifurcate them , behead them , or run em through . red sprays all over the white snow . anyway , they wind the series up with a bang . one of the strangest , most unique , and unusual series ever produced anywhere . worth it if you do n't mind the violence
dvd	i heard so much about masaki kobayashi 's `` harakiri '' , so i bought it at amazon and watched it . wow , this movie is awesome ! ! now i do n't know who is my # 1 favorite director , akira kurosawa or masaki kobayashi . this black and white movie intensifies the theme of this movie along with the music by tohru takemitsu . in addition to these assets , the camera is wonderful . i pick this movie as one of `` my movies of my life '' . tatuyua nakadai was shining in this movie . i like him more after seeing `` harakiri '' .
dvd	this has always been a favorite film of mine . the story is old-fashioned yet fun and the cast is divine . despite having the vhs , i wanted more and ordered the dvd . beware ! this dvd claims on its packaging to have closed captioning , but it does not ! ! no subtitles in any language , no line 21 captioning . nor does it have anything else . `` interactive menus '' means scene selections . this plain vanilla release does n't even have a trailer . this film and cast deserves better and i see no reason lion 's gate reissued this dvd with nothing added . since i bought it online , i ca n't return it and neither lion 's gate nor artisan will take it back despite the error in labeling and false advertising which is not the fault of the people i bought it from
dvd	this is the final season of hogan 's heroes . sgt . kinchloe ( ivan dixon ) left the series in season 5 and was replaced by sgt . richard baker ( kenneth washington ) . the other original cast members are still up to their wacky antics of outsmarting the nazis . and , it 's still hilarious . here 's a run down of the episodes from september 1970 to april 1971 : episode 1 : cuisine a la stalag 13 episode 2 : the experts episode 3 : klink 's masterpiece episode 4 : lady chitterly 's lover : part 1 episode 5 : lady chitterly 's lover : part 2 episode 6 : the gestapo takeover episode 7 : kommandant schultz episode 8 : eight o'clock and all is well episode 9 : the big record episode 10 : it 's dynamite episode 11 : operation tiger episode 12 : the big broadcast episode 13 : the gypsy episode 14 : the dropouts episode 15 : easy come , easy go episode 16 : the meister spy episode 17 : that 's no lady , that 's my spy episode 18 : to russia without love episode 19 : klink for the defense episode 20 : the kamikazes are coming episode 21 : kommandant gertrude episode 22 : hogan 's double life episode 23 : look at the pretty snowflakes episode 24 : rockets or romance if you have the previous 5 seasons , hey , you might as well get this one ! it was the end of a great tv series that brought a lot of enjoyment to millions . it still does .
dvd	as the other reviewers make clear , this is a disturbing film in that the college girl forced into prostitution ends up by developing feelings for the man who `` ruined '' her . so you may immediately assume that the director has a deeper comment to make beyond this trite observation . problem is , having just watched the movie , i am not convinced there is anything below the surface . prostitution is a fact of life in asian cities , the theme of women overcome by their desires and in thrall to strong men a common one , and i searched in vain for any subversion of or challenge to that fantasy ( as fantasy it is ) . is this any more than a homage to the inutility of futility ? not that i can see
dvd	i rented this ( sigh ) several years ago , liked it or julia roberts enough to buy it but did n't open the new copy until the other day and watched it today . i regretted buying a new copy after all , remembering it only as a few heartwarming ( i did n't want my heart warmed ) months in the lives of just plain folks in ct. ( incidentally , the 3 girls are not sisters , just 2 of them . ) i made fun of it , my friend made fun of it , i watched a few minutes then turned it off , then watched some more , finally got up to about 40 minutes and decided to finish it . it has charm . it is a soap opera , but i thought it was well acted and well done . it had humor , happiness , sadness , embarrassment ( like the barrels of fish in the rich kid 's car ) , love . it had so much plot that it practically had none at all . and i liked it . but now , 15 minutes later , i 'm beginning all over again to wonder why i bought it . i could have done without hearing sinatra singing in the background toward the end of the flick . that man was a nauseous menace and could barely sing at all , no range , no depth , somehow he could carry a tune , but that 's about the size of it , speaking of size , the size of his ego ( which i assume is why he did n't deign to sing the tunes the way the songwriters wrote them or the lyrics ) would have made a mushroom cloud ! i recommend this movie if you like this kind of thing . for it 's kind , i thought it was perfectly done . i just like them a smidge more sophisticated . the vulgarity and blasphemies were delicious .
dvd	great improvements over the original dvd . enhanced for 16x9 tvs with scenes that are now clearer and actually 2.35:1 widescreen ratio . the original dvd claims an aspect ratio of `` approximately 2.35:1 '' which was not true . i own both versions and have compared viewing aspects of each . clearly this dvd is far superior and well worth the purchase price . this plays very well on my hdtv monitor ; i 'll give the old version to someone w/ an old 4x3 tv .
dvd	ladies in lavender is a rare gem in the movie world of today . this is a soft spoken tale that ignores age and looks to character . beautiful roles for older women may be hard to find these days and when a movie comes along with two such roles you could not ask for anything better than to have two wonderful ladies , judi dench and maggie smith , take on those roles . this movie was adapted from a short story of the same title but its silver screen life comes from the actors who played their parts to perfection . the movie takes place in a small cornish village where the viewer is given an immediate sense of isolation - perhaps isolation from life , from emotions and from vulnerabilities . the sisters ursula and janet widdington , played by dench and smith , spend a quiet , uninvolved existence , venturing out rarely . but on one of their walks along the beach that they find a young man washed ashore after a storm . a bit befuddled they nevertheless take this young may into their home to help him recuperate . this one act of kindness leads to unexpected consequences for we see that age is not a barrier to unleashing emotions , feelings that have been hidden for so many years . it is the ability of dench and smith to portray these emotions , these feelings , for the camera that make this movie sing . and the melody of the movie is also carried nicely by the supporting roles played by daniel bruhl and natascha mcelhone . together these actors make this move work on several levels to give the viewer a splendid evening 's entertainment .
dvd	hi folks , the movies all look very good..and there are a nice group of bonus features from vintage featurettes to commentaries ! on macao ... i particularly enjoyed the 30 minute interview with jane russell and robert mitchum that robert osborne conducted ... very late in the life of mr mitchum . the packaging it great and frankly 6 films from the great robert mitchum at under $ 10 each on dvd w/bonus features is a terrrrrifffic deal ! the movies are n't generally considered mitchum 's best or best known but when you consider you 've got jean simmons as a costar and otto preminger directing angel face , josef von sternberg helming macao , vincent minnelli directing home from the hill , the great fred zinneman directing and the legend deborah kerr co-starring in the sundowners ... you can figure this is n't the bottom of the barrel either ! oh and sydney pollack directed the yakuza and contributes a great commentary ... . to sum up ... warner bros ... continues to deliver the very best classic titles on dvd with the best combination of quality transfers/bonus features and value packages ! ! ! !
dvd	ok , the original is a classic and is what ... 90 ... 100 minutes long ? jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story . the native were scary . the quiet scenes with kong were welcome additions , they actually made him into a character ... something that ca n't be said for any of the human characters . the insect scenes are ridiculous ! ! the dinosaur stampede was idiotic . anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie . now jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with ? ! ? peter jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story efficiently.remind me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics
dvd	2 1/2 stars . this is a very good concert teaming up a pre- '' grammy '' santana with wayne shorter of weather report fame . great rhythm section , drums , conga , timbale . top notch musicians , first rate performance , very entertaining . my big problem comes with the quality of the dvd . i do n't see the excellent picture others are raving about and when it comes to the audio options even if the back cover states dd 2.0 , dd 5.1 and dts , the menus are showing something else ( dd2.0 , dts 2.0 and dts 5.1 ) but neither dts stream seem to be working . only dd stereo works . i own close to 200 dvd 's and all work fine , dts and all . bought it directly from amazon , i had it replaced and the new one is the same . this is not part of the great live at montreux series productions which are all great , no matter how old the concert is . so the 2 1/2 stars overall rating comes from 4 star performance combined with a 1 star dvd quality .
kitchen	this is the worst pan i have ever had . we love mini muffins and have had wilton and other pans . they are hard to clean so i thought i would buy this one and cleaning would be a snap . 1st . the silicone smell was horrible . 2nd . the pan warped in oven . i used the sled it came with and followed directions 3rd . i washed in hot soapy water 3 times and still muffin residue 4th . the muffins did not come out . i used spray i waited until cool and still they stuck . i will never buy silicone anything . do n't waiste your money
kitchen	i bought this about two years ago and it never worked very good for me . the handle does n't stay together very good and it does n't pick up much . i would n't recommend this sweeper to anyone . do n't waste your money on it
kitchen	cast iron pans are the way to go . no dangerous non-stick materials that emit toxic smoke if you overheat them . this one is probably the best i have ever owned . only criticism is that it is huge and difficult to heat evenly on a normal size gas burner . bacon tends to brown at the center while remaining uncooked on the edges . but for pancakes , etc . this is perfect . get this one and a smaller 10 '' pan and you 'll have bases covered .
kitchen	my boxers just love the little balls . they like digging them out of the container even though it did not take very long after they got the hang of it . they carry the balls and container all over the house and yard . it has held up very well . we have had this over a year now , and i only had to stich up maybe 2 of the balls once each . squeekers still work great - have n't needed to replace yet . very happy with this toy
kitchen	the windtunnel ii is a poorly constructed vacuum . it is less than six months old and the motor for the hepa filter had to be replaced . it is very messy when you have to empty the tank . dust and dirt collect around the hepa filter and falls down when you are emptying the tank .
kitchen	my cat asked me to submit the following review : `` hi , my name is obadiah , and i am n lim 's cat . he has been feeding me purina cat chow indoor formula for over a year . i must say that this is excellent cat food and tastes good . before purina came out with the indoor formula , i was getting the regular purina cat chow and always had an overweight problem . weighing over 15 lbs , i never went outside and slept most of the day . this sedentary lifestyle caused some concern with my veterinarian , who said i should be down to about 12 lbs . then , i started on the indoor formula and lost those three pounds . i am lighter on my paws and can still be just as lazy as i want to be .
kitchen	large burner failed after about 12 months use . i opened it up the wire between the plug and the resistor had burned . not only is it broken , it is a fire hazard . i lost all the paperwork that came with it and i probably voided the warranty by opening it . i think i can fix it but i am not going to risk a fire , so i will try another brand
kitchen	i was not pleased with this griddle at all . after reading the positive reviews , i ordered it . maybe mine was defective , but every piece of french toast in the front of the griddle was on the verge of burning when i flipped them . it did not cook evenly for me and the directions were unclear as to what you can actually put in the dishwasher . oh well . ca n't win them all
kitchen	here i have a refurbished palinato x3 ; textured , very hardy stainless ; and a good bargain with no cosmetic flaws , -170 to start ( 6 mo warranty ) . but let me correct one point made in these reviews , the drip grill below is made of chromed plastic , a rather new trend that works quite well , the steam nob as well seems to be this material . all around this is quite an improvement on the x1 : more boiler pressure plus a more heat efficient design makes the whole machine heat in less than half the time as the x1 . cups warm quicker also . it also seems to handle ground coffee a little better . still it 's important to use a grind as fine as can be without becoming powder , and the milk should properly be low or no fat for steaming , fat content just makes more fat , not true foamed milk .
kitchen	not to be bought if you want to hatch alot of baby brine shrimp ... but great if you want to hatch an occasional snack for your fish or to have around if the power goes out . nifty , easy to use product
kitchen	we have owned this machine for a little over two years . for the first 6 months it worked as expected with clothes coming out slightly damp due to the condensation method of drying . however , since then , it has stopped drying , such that 5 hours of drying ( yes , 5 hours ) yields wet clothes . this has persisted , despite 4 repairs , replacing almost every part on the machine except the control board , which i assume is next . prior to this machine we owned an equator brand washer/dryer combo which was a disaster : that broke after 3 years . unfortunately , the lg is probably the best of a bunch of mediocre machines ( equator , asko , maber and other brands ) available in the us..all have shortcomings as dryers as all use the ventless-condensation method which take much longer to dry and almost all are 115v . the bosch combos available in europe , but unfortunately not available in the us , are 220v and thus , dry more quickly . this is not a machine for a family , but rather ideal for an apartment or condo for 1 or 2 people at most . when it worked , it worked well . however , no one should invest $ 1300 to have it break in such a short time . and no one should have to spend over 5 hours to do 1 load of laundry . if you must purchase one of these machines ( for reasons of space ) , buy an extended warranty
kitchen	i purchased 2 of these perforated pizza pans and they are perfect for baking pizza , also , i found them great for baking breads and other items as well . i would reccomend this product to anyone that bakes they are easy to clean up and can store very easy .
kitchen	i received this as a christmas gift . i 've used it to carry wine to parties and even onto an airplane . i had a tote large enough for this to fit into when it contained two bottles . i found that it is just enough protection to keep the bottles fron clinking without adding extra weight when you 're flying . it 's the best way i 've ever known for carrying wine bottles anywhere
kitchen	the delonghi heater is light weight , has multiple settings , safety knock-over switch , thermostat and a remote . i have moved it room to room and it has worked wonderfully . the price was reasonable . i would buy it again . this is a good brand
kitchen	this percolator is not worth the price . the coffee tastes lousy and it does not stay hot . i returned mine and purchased the farberware fcp512s 12-cup cordless percolator . i love it !
kitchen	i have really nice dansk everyday dishes , but needed something lightweight and less breakable for frequent outdoor use . i have to admit , these dishes are really stylish ! they look great on the table , are very lightweight , stack very compactly and are a nice large size . the only thing keeping me from giving these dishes a 5 star rating is the bowls . they are small , and while they look really cool , the squareness makes them hard to get a spoon around . if you 're looking for bigger bowls for cereal , you could easily fill in your set with the standard white bowls that corelle makes . for salads , the square ones work just fine . a word of pricing caution : on amazon at this moment they are $ 69 a set . i bought mine for $ 49 per set at my local walmart
kitchen	i understand the appeal of having the convenience of a spout on a bottle of oil , but be aware that the spout will allow air into the bottle . you may think air only gets in when you pour oil out , but that 's not true . any time the temperature rises , the air in the bottle expands and some escapes through the spout . when the temperature drops , air enters the spout . this is true of even small changes in temperature such as you experience in a kitchen . if you do n't use the oil pretty quickly this constant exchange of air will expose the oil to oxygen and that will cause the oil to go rancid . if you use cheap olive oil ( and pretty much all grocery store olive oil is cheap oil -- even the extra virgin ) you may not notice as much since cheap oils tend to be more bitter than good olive oils , but it will still happen . i would never put olive oil in a bottle with a spout again . ( i learned this lesson the hard way . ) a better option , though less elegant , is to use a bottle with a pour spout and cap , or find a pour spout that has a cap to seal it
kitchen	this is the fourth piece of furntiure i have bought from this line ( mission , natural ) . i love it . i have a bookcase and two tables that originally were for a computer work center , but use them as night-stands . it fits my 1950 's contemporary home perfectly . price is great . delivery even better . i ordered on a saturday night and received it by tuesday noon . i could n't ask for more .
kitchen	i prefer my spoons to stand upright . many of my spoons fall out of this one , i guess it depends on your shape of the spoon
kitchen	i bought two of these and within 3 days of each other they both stopped putting out any moisture . what a waste of my time and effort
kitchen	absolutely fab ! ! ! shiny-bright stainless steel , matches frieling french press , and any other stainless tableware/countertop items perfectly ! just the right size for serving a table of 4 or so ... of course the sugar bowl holds plenty- note you 'll likely need to refill the creamer for a second cup go-around at a table seating 4-6 coffee lovers . overall these are just very sturdy/solid , clean-up beautifully and very easily , and , by the way , the sugar spoon included with the lid-covered sugar bowl dispenses an exact teaspoon of sugar , and sets inside the little 'notched ' area of the lower bowl , so that the spoon rests perfectly inside the sugar bowl while the the lid remains covered/on at the same time- a really simple , yet european-engineered , well-thought out design quality . i fully anticipate that this will be an heirloom hand me-down ... although it 's a l-o-o-o-ng time until i 'll be distributing my assets ! make sure to buy the matching frieling french press- it 's just incredible , also heirloom quality ! give yourself the gift of european quality coffeeware- it 's one of life 's simple , yet indispensible indulgences ! ps the frieling french coffee press w/ this matching sugar/creamer set makes a unique and favorite wedding gift too
kitchen	we have total enjoyed the margaritaville maker . we have discovered many normal drinks taste great when you mix them in this blender . if you are into the creamy ( i.e . baileys ... ) drinks they are lighter and more enjoyable . we are very happy we purchased this
kitchen	i bought this grill after reading reviews for many different grills , i thought this one seemed to have the better reviews , so i bought it . i really love it . it heats up pretty quickly , and has enough space for 2-3 people 4 people would have to eat slower , but it does have enough broiler space , and its square to have people at all 4 sides . we use it 2 time a month at least and makes a great fast meal . the only thing that causes some distress is that the grill is not quite as easzy to clean as they say . most of it comes off very easily , but some spots of cooked grease remain , it comes of with some elbow grease , and a scrubby , but it would be nice if it was as easy as they said it was
kitchen	i absolutely adore these kyocera knives , they are the sharpest things i have ever seen . i ordered this through witbecks , and the first one got lost in the mail -- that can always happen . when i contacted matt witbeck he responded immediately ( that night , from home ) and the next day sent me a replacement . i have never had such prompt and unquestioning customer service , and so i want to recommend witbecks to anyone
kitchen	ice bucket is smaller than i expected . otherwise , a very good product
kitchen	neither the salt mill or pepper grinder work well . it takes forever to get salt and pepper from the squeezing of the handles together and still not an adequate amount . perhaps the blades that crunch the s are not sharp enough ? very disappointed in product
kitchen	in my opinion the reset problem and occasional burbling are not problems . my main beef is it 's too hard to clean . a few weeks after replacing the filter the deposits start adding up . it has to be cleaned basically every time you refill the tank . soaking in vinegar does n't do much and requires a lot of vinegar as the entire bottom reservoir must be filled . the ( phosporic-acid based ) cleaner sold on the website is slightly better but in the final analysis you have to resort to hand scrubbing . and there 's the hitch ! you ca n't reach parts of the element , not even with a toothbrush . why they could n't center it just a little further away from the edge of the `` wall '' is beyond my comprehension . i spent more time last winter with the thing taken apart trying various methods of cleaning than with it running . i would n't buy it again
kitchen	i got these knives as a gift . ironically , the first thing to rust was the part of each knife stamped `` stainless steel '' . let 's be realistic . these knives are cheap . they 're thin and they 're not well weighted . however , they say stainless steel , and you figure that that 's what you 're getting . i hand-washed these knives and dried them immediately , but they still corroded . now comes the bad part . i wrote to their customer service department twice and did n't hear back . i finally got their address ( from the post office ) and sent them back the knives . it took three months of me emailing and calling them ( with 15+ minute wait times for each call ) to get them to send me a replacement set . the replacement set rusted in about two weeks . that was in september . i just got off the phone with miracle blade , a call during which i was interrupted so many times that i actually had to say `` i 'm going to finish my sentence '' so their rep would stop talking . they wo n't refund my money . in fact , they wo n't refund anyone 's money after 30 days . the lifetime warranty is for replacement only . they 'll send me another set of soon-to-be-rusty knives , of course -- if i pay the shipping and handling ... again . i asked the rep for his full name , for his id # , and for a manager , and he refused all requests . in summary , if you buy these knives , they will rust . you will want to get rid of them . your only option will be the garbage can
kitchen	more thought needs to be put into the design of this produc
kitchen	i bought three of these mugs based on a recommendation by mens health magazine . none of the mugs works correctly and the chrome ring on the cover has come off of each one . initially this looks like a great idea but if the slots do n't line up just right the mug will not work . i have three of these mugs and each set of slots lines up differently . stay away from this product if you wish to avoid agravation
kitchen	received this as a gift and i must say i 'm very disappointed . at its highest setting it takes forever to toast . the other issue is that if you buy any bread with `` non-standard '' width ( like home-made , gourmet breads ) it wo n't fit into the toaster
kitchen	i bought these for christmas presents for a few people - and they loved them ! they were an incredible deal , warm , and appropriately sized . they were so great that now i want to go back to get some for myself . colors were great too
kitchen	i bought it some time ago for much less , also from amazon . it is not worth $ 24.00 . may be $ 6.9
kitchen	after 3 -1/2 years of pulling 4 to 8 shots of expresso per day , and steaming hundreds of gallons of delicious foamy milk , this little steam toy still works like new . better than new , actually , because it has a better operator . good results require a bit of experimentation with the variables of different grinds and quantities of coffee and durations of extraction . i 've come home many times to discover that i 'd left the electric switch on all day , but not to fear , the thing does n't burn up , so far . on other occasions , i 've overloaded the pump by letting the reservoir run dry and then adding water to try to resume extraction through a filter that had become clogged from the interruption of the flow of water . the pump keeps going even with the output blocked down to a trickle . this will happen to you from time to time because you will neglect to refill the reservoir . when it happens , just start over with dry coffee . you will also need to buy a small diameter tamper - mine is 49mm . the expresso liquor always has crema and never tastes sour to me , even when using cheap brands of dark roast like eight o clock and community coffee . everything i 've said about the brilliance of this machine is contingent , howver , on the coffee grinder . without a good grinder , you might as well just make drip coffee . the secret good expresso , in my experience , is 25 % expresso machine and 75 % grinder . a good grinder is the gaggia , which i bought from amazon for $ 175 with a discount , or the rancillio rocky , which i would have gotten in the first place had i understood the importance of an excellent grinder . this machine is small and light enough to take with you to the motel when you 're on a road trip , and cheap enough to leave behind if you forget to put it in your car the next morning . my next expresso machine will be much more expensive , but not because i 'm trying to obtain a higher quality brew . my only reasons for paying more are to get double shots and the solenoid valve , which will eliminate the spills of hot soupy grounds when emptying the porta-filter . also , when you get familiar with the operation of a machine , you 'd like it to last so you do n't have to learn a new set of techniques
kitchen	i very much like this sommlier glass but they are quite fragile . a significantly better choice for everyday use is the schott zwiesel diva line of glasses . granted , the riedel glass is thinner at the rim but man , for my dollar , the schott glasses are a steal
kitchen	i bought this for my mother-in-law at her request . she has arthritis and saw it on tv . she also wanted the free gripper that came with it . i scoured the listings at amazon looking for one that included the gripper , even paid a little more for it . she used the can opener once and it broke . the `` free '' gripper required sending away for it and an inflated s fee
kitchen	bought this set at target 3 years ago for $ 200 , and during the first few months was seriously impressed by them . they 're heavy , cooked things well , and the stainless handles are strong and stay cool . never once put them in the dishwasher or put any utensil ( metal , etc ) in them that did n't belong in them . took care when washing , did n't burn things in them , etc . somehow the finish still flaked off of both skillets starting at 6 months , and the pots have now also been showing the early signs of retirement . because i did n't want to pay return shipping or get a replacement set , and the flaking finish was too dangerous for donating , they had to go straight to the trash . very upsetting that such gorgeous pots and pans had such a short life , with high care and high cost . the 2nd star is because they are beautiful and i cooked every day with these - if you rarely cook and plan to take care of these , they might work for you . for me , stainless steel and cast iron is the way to go . i would n't even try another `` non-stick finish ''
kitchen	this dispenser has a strong resistance and makes it difficult to pull back the lever with the thumb . when it closes , it tends to leave behind a drop of syrup that can run down the side
kitchen	the picture in the ad does n't do these pots and pans justice . they are very very shining and heat evenly and fast
kitchen	have owned this product five weeks and used it several times to cook hamburgers , london broil , steaks . it produces excellent results and is relatively easy to use . the cooking grate can only be set at two levels : standing on its posts or inverted , lying on the rim of the firebox . the level must be chosen before you start cooking , which presents a problem for some preparations . the damper seems to have little effect on cooking temperature . emptying ash is a bit awkward , as you need to remove the doors and coal grate , then lift and tip the firebox , which is heavy . the lip catches some ash , so it is difficult to completely empty . be sure to set the grill on a pan , as grease will leak through and collect around the legs
kitchen	evidently the people at krups did n't try this coffeemaker before they put it on the market . the caraffe is hard to take out and put back in . it scrapes the lid every time . they say it keeps the coffee warm if you preheat the thermos but why then have a timer ? you need a microwave handy if you want a hot cup of coffee . you never know how much coffee is left in the caraffe . also you need to turn the caraffe upside down for the last few cups . i 'm sure this is the last krup 's product i will buy .
kitchen	i was one of the lucky ones to get this king size comforter . it appears to be a little on the thin side , but is very warm . i got this for the dogs and they seem to like it . the pillow shams are only standard instead of king . very good price too . ! ! ! !
kitchen	i was surprised at the quality of these knives for the price . i was not prepared to spend a rediculous amount of money on a knife set with a blade for every plausible occasion . this set has the perfect number of knives and each one feels natural in the hand . although this set comes with a sharpener , i recommend getting the wüsthof 2904 knife-life knife and scissor sharpener . you will not need to sharpen these knives much , but that sharpener will make your life much easier and will renew every single pair of scissors in your house . i also recommend , as others have , to never place these knives in the dishwasher . also be sure to washt hem by hand and thoroughly dry them immediately after use . this will drastically increase their longevity . if you purchase these , and i propose you do so , then get a travel roll bag for knives . this is because you will want to take them to friends ' and family 's homes to `` show them off ''
kitchen	i ordered two based on the description that the mug keeps the coffee hot and that it is spill proof . the coffee barely comes out of the lid to sip and when i tip it up to even get a drop more of it seeps out of the area where it screws on so it drips down the front of me . it is a very frustrating mug to drink from . the only thing that is good about it is that it is very well insulated and does keep the coffee hot .
kitchen	this container is way too small to keep any fish in , let alone two . in such a small container , the fishes ' wastes will build up quickly , causing eye and skin irritation , sickness , even death . you can try to reduce the waste build up changing the water frequently , but not only is this a lot of work for you , it is stressful for the fish . in addition , if you want to keep bettas in a divided tank , there should be decorations for the fish to hide behind when they need a break from flaring at each other . this tank is too small to allow that , another source of stress . thirdly , bettas are tropical fish . they need a tank heated to a constant 80f . it is not possible to safely heat a tank that is smaller than 5 gallons . if you want to get bettas , please read some of the excellent websites available and learn all you can about their care . if you can not afford a proper tank , please do n't get a fish
kitchen	i returned the honeywell 6011i humidifier because the product had 2 defects and the product was very poorly designed . the 6011i humidifier had 2 defects right out of the box . the first was that the 6011i humidifier would not run on the high speed setting but did run on the low and medium speed settings . the second defect was that the cap for one water container had no rubber o-ring seal and the water bottle leaked when upright in its normal operating position . the fact that this 6011i humidifier had 2 defects says that the quality control for this product must be very low and implies this product suffers from an above average failure rate . the 6011i humidifier has major design defects that make it difficult to operate and maintain the 6011i humidifier . the design defects are so major that the person ( s ) that designed and approved the design of the 6011i humidifier should be shot or at least fired ! the first major design defect is that the water bottles will not stand up by themselves in my sink . because of this i must hold the water containers vertically with my hand and still can not completely fill the water container to the top . the screw-on caps for the water containers are so large they are difficult for my wife with small hands to screw on while holding the water container vertically upright . the next design defect is that one can not at a glance check the water level in the water containers but must pick up the water containers and turn them over to check the water level in the container . one can see if the water container is empty or nearly empty at a glance , but this is of no use if one wants to quickly see if there is enough water in the water containers to last until one returns home from work or will last through the night . the last design defect of the 6011i humidifier is that the water containers and humidifier fan housing do not just `` drop into place '' on the base . one must use one hand as a guide for the water container and then still fiddle with the position/angle of the water container to get it to seat properly . this is even more difficult if both water containers are removed for filling at the same time . i bought this 6011i humidifier to replace a honeywell humidifier that finally failed after many years of faithful service . i also selected the 6011i humidifier because of its many desirable features . however the positive product features were significantly outweighed by the poor quality control and the poor design of the 6011i humidifier . i believe that a humidifier should be designed for usability first and esthetics second , not the other way around as is the case with the 6011i humidifier . thus i returned the 6011i humidifier
kitchen	keeps the tank warm for my little fish friend
kitchen	this pillow holds the heart shape better than i expected from some of the other reviews . we have been careful so that it does not burst because of others warnings about the mess . still my daughter has made good use of this pillow and still sleeps with it every night
kitchen	i have tried many different coffee makers and being a coffee junkie i keep looking for the combination of simplicity , cost and excellent coffee - this has all three ! the first two or three times i tried this the coffee did n't come out that good , either too weak or not enough body but now i have it down and the coffee is excellent . i make a double espresso and then add in extra water to fill my travel mug for my 2 hour commute each day . the other good news ... i 've now found a good use for my single cup coffee maker - it produce the right amount of water at the right temprature to use in the aeroexpress .
kitchen	i have two of these , one in yellow and one in a discontinued sea greeny color . they 're attractive , of course ; this is fiestaware , after all . but they 're darn functional . they 're long enough to accommodate a london broil or small roast or kebobs , and they 're deep enough that any juices are not likely to spill while you 're carrying or serving . i like wish there was one slightly bigger too ; then i 'd get two more
kitchen	we bought this canister set to compliment the stoneware we purchased from the same set . i am especially impressed with the seal used on these canisters . you would swear it is mechanical ; the lids open easily , yet seal tight when simply placing the lid on the canister . they are very high quality and look much better than the stainless steel ones we were considering before finding these . recommended
kitchen	i would have given it 5 stars but my gerbils chewed the house up within a week or two and now after a couple of months they no longer have ramps . currently , they 're working on chewing up the shelves . so i 'm off to buy one that 's entirely wire . wish i had done that in the first place
kitchen	i 've been wanting a knife sharpener for decades but just could n't justify spending over one hundred dollars on one when , wa la , i discovered the wusthof 2904 model on amazon ! it 's so easy to use and , while the scissor sharpener does take some practice , it 's wonderful to have useable kitchen shears and regular scissors once again ! sheryl , california
kitchen	my wife and i have used this machine for several weeks now . we found it to be a great machine for the price . others complained about the lack of attachments because of the odd size of the wands , so i immediately machined an adapter that allows us to use any tool from most other american vacuums . now there are no limitations as to what surface the machine can be used on . this thing is lite , strong , and easy to empty . the cord retractor is a little lite so i would n't be to rough with it . garrett and susan
kitchen	the way the brush is situated on the handle makes this brush difficult to use . i would get the furminator instead , it has the same deshedding edge but a much easier to use overall design and it comes in larger sizes ! this technology is great and you will be so shocked when you see all the hair you are able to remove
kitchen	the filter is the make and size recommended by the manufacturer of the humidifier . it works really well .
kitchen	i use this in my 29 gallon , and the filter is excellent . the best part about it is the ability to control the amount of water brought in . it is also very quiet . however , when the power goes out and comes back on , it wo n't begin working again . you must add water to it to get it up and running . this has been a problem when i 've gone on vacation and i 've come home to cloudy water . the refills are also pretty expensive , and can get a bit messy . it 's all worth it , though . it keeps my tank in nice condition . :
kitchen	i just bought 2 of these tables to use as nightstands . i have a very high bed , and thought they would be too short and too small ... but they are perfect ! i love the extra storage at the bottom , and the little drawer is very useful as well . assembly took no time at all , and the tables turned out extremely sturdy . i am very pleased !
kitchen	after mixing your dough and letting it rise the first time , this basket helps shape the dough into a perfect loaf , with an interesting pattern on the crust . my first loaf with this basket turned out perfectly . it is much easier than hand shaping a loaf , and much more rustic/natural than using a loaf pan . the natural coils shape and decorate the loaf the old-fashioned way . when it 's done rising , carefully remove it from the basket and care fully put it on a pre-heated bread stone in the oven . the loaves look and taste great
kitchen	walnut tradition kitchen scissors ( asin : b00005am7r ) do not have `` comfortable wood handles secured with triple-brass rivets '' , they have unattractive chocolate-brown plastic handles . the bottle opener and screw driver extensions are a poor design feature , and simply get in the way .
kitchen	i purchased this item thinking it would be great for my 5 yr old 's room . he has a 19 inch tv/vcr/dvd combo that will not fit into the space that was designed to hold a `` 20 inch '' tv . if you have a modern tv with speakers on the side it will not fit ! ! ! ! ! i purchased the item directly from step2 and they do not want to refund my shipping fees or pay for me to return the item ! ! ! !
kitchen	i 'm terribly disappointed . the feed chute is tiny ( barely big enough for two fingers ) , the tray above the chute does n't hold anything ( most things fall out ) , clean-up is a nightmare , and it takes forever to get a usable glass of juice . stick with a centrifugal juicer like the breville elite 800 , unless you enjoy torturing yourself
kitchen	unless you love the look of this pepper grinder , i 'd suggest you look elsewhere . when compared to a generic grinder , this product produces inferior and very inconsistent grinds . i 've gone so far as to grind peppercorns onto a white sheet of paper to look at them . with this grinder you 'll always get a huge variation in the grind . some of the pieces of the peppercorns will be large enough that it would give anyone pause to wonder whether foreign matter had somehow entered the dish . the oval top is quite slippery and when you tighten down the top nut to reduce the grind to something that will prove acceptable , you 'll have trouble turning it . not recommended
kitchen	i find it more than a bit ridiculous that pur charges 40 dollars for their product and 20 - 25 dollars for their replacement filters . i have owned 3 pur sink mounted water filters and every one of them has ended up in the garbage within the first year of use . why ? because they begin to leak at the faucet connection and this leak grows progressively worse over time . tightening the unit does not help and in fact may make the leak worse . removing and reinstalling the unit does not help . i have become so frustrated by pur water products that i will never again purchase anything made by them . i just installed a brita filter on my sink a couple of days ago and no problems yet and even if any do occur the brita is more reasonably priced at up to 15 dollars cheaper for the sink mounted unit . do yourself a favor and avoid this over-priced piece of junk at all costs
kitchen	great product at a great price . the first shipment came broken and amazon replaced it immediately without the hassles of having to return a broken item . thank you
kitchen	my lab mix had the rope detached from the tennis ball material in less than 20 minutes . in the same time , she 'd broken some of the individual strands of the nylon rope , so if one thing had n't broken something else would have . not durable , not recommended
kitchen	not much to be said about this product . just watch for a low price and then stock up
kitchen	3 cups ? i do n't know where this teeny thing would equal that- not even 3 demitasse/espresso cups . amazon really should make the 'see larger image ' say 'see life size ' ( try it ) ... or better yet show something for scale- like 10 coffee beans- the amount it holds . so , i 'm already kinda down on this liliputian trinket and i check instructions to see if i can heat the water in the microwave- like i do with my other 'real size ' french press ( without the top ) . no , nothing saying that should be a problem ... 2 minutes later the rubber bottom mat is burning furiously in my microwave ! i 'd hope hugo had a 'bonjour ' because i certainly didn't..
kitchen	we love this crate for our pug , but she is a smart little dog . she has learned how to get the zipper on the end undone and escape . of course , when she does this no one is home and we find small gifts left behind
kitchen	this was a special offer and the price seemed excellent . description stated `` standard classic white goose down feather pillow '' . a more accurate description would have been `` mostly feather pillow with some goose down , skimpily filled '' . i would have purchased better quality had the description been more accurate ; i.e . larger quantity is listed first with additional quantities listed in descending order . vendor should have precisely listed percentage of feather to down content , as they did with other catalog items . i believe they kept description fuzzy leading one to believe it was a fantastic offer rather than what it was . caveat emptor
kitchen	we had an ancient kitchen aid and i loved it ... but always had to store it in the cupboards since it was so big and clunky . our daughter now has it and is happy with it . we bought the hamilton beach mixer and i like it almost as much as the kitchen aid . the best thing about it is that the mixer lifts up , making things a bit easier . the only slight complaint i have is that the medium to high speed is a big jump ... it 's a little too fast for what i want , most of the time . another plus is that it sits beautifully on my counter
kitchen	i wish that i had purchased the sheet set earlier so that i could have enjoyed them all winter , they are so comfortable , even with flannel pj 's i did n't have any problem turning over . i completely recommend this sheet .
kitchen	simple , straight forward to use . very easy to clean . and durable . ca n't beat it for the price . better than any drip
kitchen	i did not buy the whole set . my review is for an 8 '' fry pan . it was one of those `` try it '' deals . i do not like the grooves in the pan because after , for instance , frying an egg , the grooves retain food and if you do n't use a brush to scrub the grooves you 'll find that after it has dried there are going to be bits of food caught in the grooves . i ca n't imagine cleaning a whole set of this cookware . yikes
kitchen	you can hold this in both hands and your finger will only overlap a little . 18 oz 's is a lot of water
kitchen	i 've had this coffeemaker for two weeks . i bought it because i had an old mr. coffee that worked fine , but was white and stained . i liked that this was black and looked sleek . the very second time i used it , the off button stuck , so you can no longer turn off the machine , but have to wait for it to turn itself off . also , every pot has grounds in it . i 'm using the filters that came with it , and have never even filled it to capacity , and i ca n't figure out why there are always grounds in my coffee . piece of junk . do n't buy it
kitchen	i like it very much . kettle is in a good working condition and it looks good in a kitchen with all stainless steel appliances . i would recomend to purchase this kettle as a good quality item .
kitchen	i bought this sweeper to sweep my basement carpet , which is dark in color and shows every bit of fuzz . it does a reasonable job cleaning , transforming my carpet from `` does she ever vacuum ? '' to `` oh , she must have vacuumed yesterday '' . it does n't get all the fuzz and crumbs , but it does what i 'd expect from a sweeper . it is also much lighter than my vacuum , so i 'm much more likely to use it . my three-year-old daughter enjoys using it too . she insists on sweeping her own room ( i wo n't complain ) . the main thing i 've learned is that , because the handle slides together , it will not consistently support the weight of the sweeper head . this means that if you pick it up or suspend it by the top of the handle , the sweeper will probably fall off , so pick it up near the sweeper . ( it stays together fine when actually sweeping .
kitchen	i am a very experienced user of innova . innova is i guess you can say is the parent company of ultrex which is a line of nonstick cookware . innova is not know for quality and this product is no different . there is a 25 year warranty on the ultrex , i had mine for 6 years and the nonstick coating is off . you can return the product for another but yes , you have to pay for the shipping and if your pot is oversized , you have to pay ups or whomever to make you a box and thats another charge . the customer service is not world class . i had to wait almost 3 months for a replacement . the workmanship is horrible , the product is made in china , however , i 've had other things made in china that were of great quality , so i do n't know what is up with innova . i suggest that if you find a product made by innova , avoid it ! save yourself the aggrevation ! this product does n't deserve 1 star
kitchen	loses grip on can and the can slips off ... bad product . do not buy
kitchen	the knife is constructed well - as pictured - does not cut very well . it just was not very sharp . i tried mincing some vegetables - it just did n't work as well as my $ 9.99 serrated tv info knife . i was disappointed
kitchen	lousy ! ! ! ! the handle design makes the cuisipro grater extremely difficult to hold . there is a big space between the drum and the hopper and big pieces of cheese fall through . i grate a lot of cheese , and i am sorry i bought this grater
kitchen	i 've had this for over a month and i 've only made grilled chicken with squash and asparagus . if you do n't marinate your meat it will get really dry . easy to clean , most of the time..
kitchen	the pump broke within 2 weeks and i have n't been able to find a replacement . it would be under warranty but i threw away the paperwork ( my bad ) because usually i keep everything and then it just clutters up and i never have a problem . however , i still think the product should last a little longer than that ! i purchased mine at petsmart and we live too far away to return it although i had tossed the box , etc
kitchen	unfortunately , there is no option for 0 star . i had the same problem as lana from nc . i ordered the product , and when i opened the box , i found that i received only the bottom piece . when i asked if the remaining pieces could be shipped , i was told that partial products are not shipped and that i would have to get an entirely new order . fine , other than i have to go through the hassle of waiting in line at the post office to return the wrong one . except , if they do n't ship partial products , then why did i receive a partial product to begin with ? i received the second , mind you the replacement order , and the same exact thing happened - i received only the bottom piece . so now i have to shlep both packages to the post office and waste my time for their error . i suggest doing a search of metrokane cocktail shaker and you will find a couple other sites selling the same product . one site even has 2 different sizes if anyone is looking for a smaller shaker
kitchen	just a word of advice : if your dog is used to playing tug of war with a rope they will easily pick this toy up . if they are n't , it probably is not the toy for your dog . at first , my chocolate lab was a little leery because he never had a bottle as a toy . it took a couple days of playing tug of war and leaving the tug a jug on the floor before he really knew it was `` his '' . once i finally got him used to realizing it was his own , he saw me put his kibble in it . then it took a little bit before he was able to figure out how to work it . granted , the interactive part is you helping your dog realize the toy 's value . now , it is something that can occupy him for 20-25 minutes . he 'll do anything for treats . although , i 'm not sure that he really , really likes it but he focuses in on it until every kibble disappears . i think that it is good for him and makes him do something different to get treats . i like interactive toys : ) on the other hand , our little dog , still does n't know how to get the treats out or how to use this toy . just a guess , he probably never will figure it out . so , some dogs will take to it , and others will look at you like you 're crazy for giving them a toy that does n't squeak
kitchen	pros : towels are good in quality . absorb water very well . decent in length . soft . cons : have lint coming off when trying to wipe wet skin . still need to put it through a wash to see if it leeches colour
kitchen	i had a pampered chef sprayer that i loved , but it got clogged and stopped working after 2 or 3 years . i should have tried harder to find a pampered chef rep to buy another one , the pampered chef one works better than this one . however , this is not a horrible product . one drawback compared to the pampered chef one is that you ca n't see through this one to see how high the oil level is . you want to fill it just a bit higher than halfway , and when it is less than 1/3 full you need to fill it back up or it wo n't work as well . this unit is even more finicky than the pampered chef one about the level , it almost wo n't spray if the level is too low . but since you ca n't see through it , even holding it up to the light , you have to look down in and estimate how high it is . the reflective coating inside makes it very hard to see how high it really is . you do n't want to fill it all the way up , either . then , you need to pump it more than the pampered chef one needed to be pumped . this one sprays a very fine spray , finer than the pampered chef one . and it sprays quite nicely if you have the correct level of oil in there . i think i know why my old one got clogged . so i 'm trying something new : each time i 'm done , before i put it away , i twist the screw on cap around the nozzle and release the pressure . i think if you leave it pressured up all the time , like i did with my old one , it damages the nozzle over time . but time will tell if i 'm right . another tip -- do n't fill it with anything but olive oil . other oils evaporate and leave a sticky/greasy feeling on the outside of the sprayer . you know what i mean if you use vegetable oil for stovetop cooking a lot , you get that greasy feeling on things that you leave near the stove or that hang over it . olive oil does n't do that , that 's why i now do n't use anything else on my stovetop ( except sometimes peanut oil for stir frying ) . this type of sprayer will work much better if you just use olive oil in it , trust me . but if you have a choice , go find a pampered chef rep and by their sprayer . it 's cheaper and better quality
kitchen	i needed a canister vacuum that was n't too expensive that did a decent job on my hardwood and laminate floors . this vacuum worked out well . all we had was an upright and it just did n't cut it for our floors . this turned out to be a good product for the price
kitchen	having had a hoover in the past , i was excited to find this one at this price . i 've had it only a year and am now vacuum shopping once again - and will not be looking at hoovers . the parts are plastic and cheap and break easily . it advertised a power hand tool . it is not . it works on air and when you put it to any material it stops spinning . the upright power tool for carpets also stopped working after about six months . the hard wood floor tool worked fine - and suction was strong enough - but again the plastic pieces break and the attachments do n't stay on like they should , so i spend most of my time with the vacuum re-attaching the pieces . i would recommend looking elsewhere if you want a vacuum to last
kitchen	this item did not work when i got it . i returned it to zelco , who informed me that it was my error , they did not do refunds , and returned it to me . i had a previous model zelco that worked great for 10-15 years . it had a switch . this new one does not have a switch and at this time will not turn off . gr
kitchen	over the years i 've tried a good dozen humidifiers . worries about bacteria , difficulty in filling up , and difficulty in operation led me to trash them all . i now have two u7142 himidifiers . the control system is extraordinary ; you can set desired humidity , fan speed , and time to run . there is preheater ( to 40c ) that helps kill the bad stuff and use of silver ( do n't understand it but assume it works . ) to kill more bad stuff . liked the first so much i bought a second
kitchen	this machine replaces a semiautomatic delonghi , which , i thought , was decent . well ... after using this for 3 weeks , i can honestly say that my old machine was barely competent . the titanium is a wonderful machine . not only is the espresso excellent but the panerella wand makes awesome froth and the thing looks great . it 's fully programable and , once set , it 's just a matter of pushing a button to brew a delicious espresso - every time ! it warms up in under a minute , has a large bean hopper , large water resevior , very cool blue lcd display ... i ca n't rave enough . i 've had no problems at all with this machine and i recommend it heartily
kitchen	i bought these because they matched my dishes . i really wish i 'd kept my old ones , even though they were black . the size of these is nice for flour , sugar , etc . ; however , the rubber seals in them are n't great . the seal on my flour ( biggest one ) falls in every single time i take the lid off . they 're pretty , but not very functional
kitchen	sigh . was so excited to receive this item and it arrived today via ups in pieces . i should have heeded the previous reviewer 's warning . doh ! oh well . live and learn . live and learn . refund , please
kitchen	this mixer was highly reviewed at the time we bought it , but ours started conking out randomly after only 2 months -- it would work one day and then not work the next . whether it will work any particular time is uncertain enough that we are buying a new one today . no matter what the features an appliance has , that rates an automatic 1-star in my book
kitchen	this vacuum worked the first time i used it , but that was the only time . with the amount of noise it makes , you would hope that it would be removing dirt from the floor . however , what it appears to be doing is using its rotating bristles to redistribute the dirt in a thinner more homogenous layer . if you are looking for a machine to use as a sound effect prop for a jet engine , this is the one for you
kitchen	the first time i used this waffle maker i was very disappointed and regretted the purchase . however , i gave it another chance . the second time i used the recipe that came with the instructions and the waffles turned out great . my husband said they were even better than the ones i used to make . to avoid the waffle breaking when lifting them out , i lift part of the waffle slightly with a knife and slide a round wire rack under it
kitchen	saw the other review and had to share my similar experience . the glue is still not off of my pan after hours and hours of scrubbing . it 's now spread out a bit into a larger dark grey spot surrounded by steel wool scrapings . i have to return it because i know will get angry every time i pull it out of the cupboard and see the mess
kitchen	it did the job til it became defective . after a year of light use ( avg 3 times a week ) , three of the most important buttons stopped working : the start button , power level button and minute plus button . now the only way we can get it to heat anything is to use the popcorn button .
kitchen	the only good thing which occurred when i bought this item from amazon was it arrived with in two days . i was quite disappointed when i opened the package only to find it was a typical pop-up hamper i could have bought anywhere in a store thus in the long run i ended up paying more for it . i wanted to buy a pop-up hamper with a lid that you can zip it to stay closed . this hamper lacks a lid so i reccomend if you 're looking for the same thing not to buy it . if i had known it lacked a lid i would not have purchased the hamper . it 's partially my own fault for not doing enough research about the product . i gave it two stars because it 's still functional and sturdy
kitchen	although the press has a timer , i found that it does not operate as expected . it does not seem to reset quickly after opening , so i ended up timing myself . i like that it can be stored on it 's side
kitchen	i loved this while it worked . this worked great for the first 2 times we used it . after that it would n't work . it has a 6 month warranty so i am in the process of getting if fixed .
kitchen	these covers are not even close to being red . the are wine or burgundy in color
kitchen	put these next to the riedel glasses and they show very nicely considering they are half the price
kitchen	worked fine for about 6 months and then the inner surface failed . i 'm not sure precisely what happened but some part of the surface coating wore off and now it 's impossible to make a waffle that does n't stick completely to the waffle iron . a complete waste of money
kitchen	my kids have a restless reaction to foods that contain red dye 40 . my wife and i limit their exposure when we can . an example is a particular fruit snack that did not contain this dye . recently , they changed their ingredients and so we are left with no options on the snack isle . we figured we could entertain their cravings by making homemade fruit leathers . the ability to make jerky was a bonus for me . i ordered another brand that i thought was going to do the job , but once it arrived i found the construction to be subpar and it was passive , requiring rotation of the trays . i immediately sent it back to amazon . thats when i ordered this nesco unit . it is powerful , and effective . i have used it a number of times and made some really good jerky and fruit leathers . i have tried a couple of the seasonings and absolutely love them . order this and you ca n't go wrong
kitchen	i have used tendskin since college and while i ca n't say that i like it , it does work . my girlfriend introduced me to the min solution2 and i gave it a try . it works much better and i think the roller ball applicator is genius ! it smells really clean too and a bit minty .
kitchen	my little 2 years boy is crazy about thomas friends ... .his bedroom was decorated with thomas ... .but the drapes is very low quality material looks like drapes sold at dollar stores for $ 3.99 no soft is like when you use ironing starch ... . i left only 1 start because matching with the bedding ! i used only one pair with denim drapes liner under to block-out light ... .because i opened- package the other set i send back to amazon . i do not recommend this product ... .and if your boy likes dark room to sleep do not buy ! ! ! ... .i bought pottery barn thin wale corduroy panels are excellent light material and block-out light
kitchen	i have had many different kinds of wine openers ... screwpull , rabbits etc ... and nothing compares to the ease of this cork pop ! i have the `` legacy '' version . nice looking and takes less than 10 seconds to remove the foil and open the bottle ... no kidding ( okay ... i have n't really timed it ... ) . this would be great for someone with arthritic hands as there is no pulling or tugging involved ... not even to remove the cork from the opener ... just twist and the cork is removed . it is really the most amazing opener ever ! the only downside i can think of is you will have to have cartridge refills eventually ... i received mine about a month ago and have opened about 15 bottles of wine and still have plenty of `` juice '' left in the cartridge . awesome
kitchen	this is the best way to clean a grill . i use one each time that i clean the grill . this is a must buy . it is a great idea
kitchen	did not work right out of the box . the heating elements did not get hot . so i had to return it otherwise i would be throwing money away . do not buy
kitchen	we bought this waffle maker because the american ones are hard to find . and this one got great reviews . so given that we prefer american waffles to belgian waffles , we still like this waffle maker ok . very easy to clean , and definitely non-stick
kitchen	the scale does not come with a battery , even though there is a distinct place for it in the internal packaging . scale had a 2002 manufacture date on it . all of this i can live with , the bigger problem was that the scale would not zero itself . when turned on , it would drift dramatically after a couple of seconds . i timed it -40g for one minute ( and after hours ... just keep on going ... ) . the box had no signs of damage , so i 'm guessing the load cell was bad . very disappointing .
kitchen	i literally received the order 1 day after placing it . thank you
kitchen	i love water filters , this perhaps is my third , first was a brita , gave to family member years ago and it is still in use , went on to faucet style but prefer pitchers , then to this ultra . this pitcher leaks , i suspect it is the style , leak is not big-time , but pitcher will have to be replaced wayyyy too soon in a household where there is no rough treatment of kitchen items . i am not happy . elain
kitchen	the one item in your house that you really wish would suck and it certainly does n't ! this thing blows more air than it sucks dirt . what a useless thing . i 'm looking for one that will actually pick up the dirt from the recessed areas of my prefinished floor . this thing certainly does n't do it ! if you 're looking to buy this thing , look again -- there must be something better if not just your regular broom
kitchen	a little disappointing . we have several cuisinart products including a food processor that we 've had for umpteen years and still works like new . we also have 4 cuisinart pans or skillets with the same comment . the toaster toasts but not a lot better than the cheapo toaster that we replaced . we 've only used it a few times so maybe it will be better once we get used to it
kitchen	they worked so well . we decided to have a themed drink for our superbowl party this year . it was in miami so we went for pink flamingos and palm trees . we served cubano sandwiches and mojito cocktails . the mojito 's were a hit . we set up a `` mojito education station '' on our computer playing the bacardi mojito video , then we had a station set up with mint , sugar , rum , lime wedes , ice and soda water . this muddle was an excellent purchase . it did the job efficiently and well . even mojito novices got the hang of it easily . great buy and good luc
kitchen	these are good quality sheets . they are a bit narrow compared to what i 'm used to . i 've used them everyday for about 2 months now , and there are no scratches and they clean up super easy still
kitchen	does n't whistle as it is supposed to , handle get 's very hot ( i have a gas stove )
kitchen	my husband loves cereal for breakfast , and i bought it so he does n't have to go to the pantry every morning to get a box of cereal . it was a perfect fit for him , and it even accommodates the extra large cereal bowl that he uses . i was surprised at how big it was , but the stainless steel frame is incredibly beautiful . the rubber turn knob does n't jam up as easily as i expected , although dense cereal may require a bit more effort to dispense . only complaints : 1 . the top plastic covers are not completely airtight , but are fine for dry cereal . 2 . the bottom rubber covers fall out easily - they should fit more snugly
kitchen	i gave these 2 stars because they worked nice for the first couple of months , even cut through chicken bones . but just like the other reviews , the spring rusted terribly and the spring tends to pop off too easily at the most inconvenient moment . i used these for making chicken soup alot , but noticed that it also does n't always come clean between the blades and when using on chicken i like to be extra careful . so the next set i get i 'll look for a set where the blades unhinge to make sure they come clean and not from henckels this time
kitchen	this mattress pad is plush , soft and comfortable . washed it recently for the first time and the quality held very well . fits the mattress nicely and does n't move around .
kitchen	i ordered the 5 piece ble set on march 18th and still have n't received this . i keep on getting an email that it is on back order and i now wo n't get it until june 30th . costumer service is ridiculous , i was told it would take 3-5 days that 's why i ordered it . don't get it , if you need it within one yea
kitchen	my husband was skeptical , why do you need a new $ 200 pot he said . well i bought the dutch oven , with two days of receiving it i made the best beef stew he has ever had . he said the meat was much more tender than when i make the stew in a crock pot . never again will he question me when i say i need a kitchen tool
kitchen	i like this winged corkscrew but i had to repair the plastic once when the cap near the wings busted off . superglue did the job , and i have n't had trouble since
kitchen	it 's fairly cheap looking , but it does the job . the razor holders can not hold my gillette mach iii turbo razor , it slips out
kitchen	i returned this item because it was too big for the brother es2000 sewing machine i bought . it was very bulky and took up way too much room . the machine rattled inside the case and slipped around . it would probably be better for a larger machine
kitchen	this is a high quality pan , with a nice heavy weight to it - not at all flimsy . i wanted to get one like my mom 's , and this turned out to be less expensive , but a much better quality and heavier weight . i bought 2 of these , along with 2 of the smaller cookie sheets as part of amazon 's 4 for 3 promotion , and it only came to about $ 30 ! that is an incredible deal for stainless steel pans of this quality . i would absolutely recommend these
kitchen	this is a great gift because there fun , cute , and usefull so when you come home from a bad day at school or work there alaways there.to me there like a special friend that you can cuddle.so for kids and adults this is a must have
kitchen	this bowl is shallow enough to serve from and deep enough to really load it up . i use mine constantly , and did n't think i would when i bought it . we reach for this ahead of all the other bowls and platters i own . i love my fiestaware , you ca n't go wrong with these durable and colorful dishes
kitchen	this is the best book light ever . my only issue is the battery life , but i fall asleep and leave it on all night sometimes . the pages are illuminated very well and it 's easy to use . makes a great book mark , too . do n't let what i said about the batteries influence you not to buy . i have both sizes . i 'm rough on them and i 've had no problems .
kitchen	i am very pleased with the chemire dinnerware set . it is very durable and the colors are great . the dishes are larger than i had expected . they are a little heavy due to the size and thickness . i would recommend them to others
kitchen	we bought the petsafe collar for small dogs who bark entirely too much . it is made of a rigid plastic in a round shape that will not conform to the neck of any of our 3 maltese . this particular collar is meant to stay on the voice box area or it wo n't work . unfortunately , because it 's rigid , it slides up a dog 's neck very easily . i have worked with fabric and then with foam rubber trying to pad the sides so it ca n't slide . even when i can barely get a bit of fingertip between the prong and neck so that it feels too snug and is also snug on the sides , it only takes minutes for it to start sliding out of position . a shrug , a shake , or simply walking a few steps is all it takes . this is a one piece molded plastic unit and for our dogs , is not going to work . it should also be noted that if you have a nuisance barker who barks at any sound or sight , it may be effective but if you have a dog that barks at a family member , this is not a good solution as a shock collar may well result in more problems . the dog now has another negative association to the person . consult a trainer or behaviorist before buying . f. quall
kitchen	i have purchased other syrup dispensers in the past , and all of them broke . usually the thumb lever jams with dried syrup . this one is a unique design that appears to prevent this problem . and , it even comes with an extra o-ring : -
kitchen	the pitcher is made from poor quality materials . we have two pitchers and have never washed them in the dishwasher . in less than a year , both pitchers cracked along the seam that runs from the spout down the side of the pitcher . if we attempt to use them , tea immediately leaks all over the counter . since other pitchers are not compatible with the machine , our ice tea maker is useless . we have owned two previous mr. coffee ice tea models in the past ten years . the pitchers lasted for several years before eventually cracking . mr. coffee chose to use inferior materials with this model . i am very disappointed in the quality and will never trust their company again . i am now searching for an ice tea maker that uses quality materials
kitchen	the my pod and its filters work great in my senseo . now i do n't have to buy the expensive pods all the time . the only problem is i have to shut it off manually as it wo n't sense it is full and shut itself off .
kitchen	this product does not work . the dial just moves randomly . please tell me who to contact for a refund
kitchen	i almost did n't purchase these because of the reviews , but my son likes thomas , so i did . i was expecting really rough , but i do n't think they are all that bad . maybe the company has taken the reviews under consideration and changed material . anyway , the boy is quite happy with them and sleeps quite soundly .
kitchen	has to be seasoned just about everytime before use . overwise , great pan
kitchen	although this item 's description says it is made of `` commercial quality stainless steel '' it arrived with several rust spots ; so much for whatever `` commercial quality stainless steel '' means . also , be aware that the handles are not round , but are `` u '' shaped . it is difficult to clean the inner part of the handle short of using a small toothbrush . on the positive side , the locking mechanism seems to work well and i do like the non stick silicone tips . however , on the whole , i would not recommend these locking tongs .
kitchen	the hoover floormate was great the first two times we used it . along with the old english it did a great job cleaning and picking up the solution . after using it twice , it had difficulty dispensing solution from the reservoir . this was remedied by having to apply downward pressure constantly . it still got the job done . not too long after that it would n't vacuum the solution back into the unit . i got a great clean for the price divided by four uses . you do the math . i 'll stick to the `` cheap '' clorox thing we pulled out of the closet after i put the floor ex-mate into the trash . very disappointe
kitchen	get a couple of good hones instead and learn to use them . i got one of these a couple of years ago . i figured i would now enter `` easy sharp knife heaven '' , but it ruined all my knives . they are sharp , but only kind of sharp . it ground the bevels to flat and i never managed to get anything that was remotely razor sharp , and trust me , i have tried . anyhone who says razor sharp , does n't really mean razor razor sharp or may never have seen a really sharp knife . if it is n't as sharp as that scalpel you used in biology class , it is not razor sharp . i recently bought the book razor edge sharpening , and a couple of razor edge hones and hand reground all the knives i had ruined ( does n't take long if you do it right , even form a destroyed edge ) . now i finally have the ultra scalpel sharp knives i always wanted . so sharp it is almost scary . good hones are n't cheap either , but you can use them for your other tools too , like chisels , etc
kitchen	this was a horrible egg slicer . i thought something from kitchenaid that was advertised to slice strawberries or mushrooms would be worthwhile , but was i wrong . worked fine for eggs , but broke on the first strawberry . my previous one broke on the first mushroom ! do n't bother . use a knife . save the slicer for the eggs
kitchen	i was shopping in a gift store today and came across this tovolo tea infuser and it is brillant ! if you do n't use tea bags and are used to the infuser on a chain - this will spoil you . it stirs like a spoon and when you are done it sits in its craddle so that it does n't drip on anything . and the whole thing is dishwasher safe . i paid more than $ 9.95 for mine too
kitchen	we purchased the stainless steel version of this flatware when we got married 16 years ago . it has held up so well , that i just purchased ten more place settings ( the friday only sale ) to use for entertaining . our older set still looks new even though we have used it every day . this flatware is heavy and really nice to hold , ( the handles are not so heavy or thick that they are hard to hold or to eat from ) . the super simple design works and looks beautiful with any table setting design from casual and contemporary to completely elegant for special occasions .
kitchen	if you are looking for a plastic box that rotates , then look no further . if you are looking for a space heater , keep looking
kitchen	i have probably seen hundreds of tea kettles by now and still love the look of this one the best . only problem is that they rust ! ! ! i had mine a few weeks when i noticed the rust spots on the interior . i do n't imagine the enamel could have been chipped on the inside of the pot , so it must have happened simply because i leave water in my tea kettle at all times . the directions that come with this kettle say not to do so , but any serious tea drinker like me knows that 's unrealistic . i threw mine out and am very disapointed that something that cost so much money did n't last long at all . i thought le creuset was supposed to be really high quality but i 'm officially disillusioned thanks to this tea pot
kitchen	the product came chipped on the bottom so its lopsided . much smaller than anticipated , i can only fit a tablespoon in it
kitchen	i really loved the look of the lamp , and it went perfectly in my living room for a reading light next to my favorite chair . two days after i bought it , it broke at the place where it screws together on the pole . i returned it , and actually considered getting another one just because i liked the looks of it so well , but ended up just getting a refund . i was pretty disappointed , and am still looking for a lamp to replace it
kitchen	i purchased this fry pan in june of this year - and it is almost to a state where it is ready to be thrown away as of december 1st . i would have expected the nonstick surface to be of superior quality and durability from all-clad , but the sad truth is that i have had cheap grocery store pans that have maintained the coating far longer , and a small fraction of the cost . after just a few weeks the surface became scratched on this pan and the coating started to come off in the food - ick ! i love the uncoated all-clad , but i will be looking elsewhere for nonstick in the future
kitchen	there is n't much to like about these sheets . they wrinkle like crazy when you wash them and the stitching leaves a lot to be desired - hanging threads are all over the place . i would not recommend these sheets at all
kitchen	we purchased the delonghi based on its ease of cleaning ( 4 of 5 parts can be placed in the dishwasher ) . after the third use , the plastic part that holds the heating element in place melted off the base . delonghi service was apologetic , and promised to send a replacement part asap , although the part was out of stock . that was in september , almost 6 months ago . parts are still backordered ! i returned the unit to lowes in frustration , got a new unit , and it too melted on the first use . returned it for credit . do not consider this unit .
kitchen	i have been searching for a baster with an injector . this one looked good . it works ok with the injector but it does not work at all as a regular baster . i guess i will keep searching
kitchen	i recently purchased this double boiler and i am very happy with it . it is a good quality stainless and that is important . i love the `` vintage '' style , it is a satin finish and has an interesting shape , much like one that grandma had many years ago . the boiler insert is 6 '' deep , not counting the lid , and perfect for making frosting , candy , custard , anything that requires gentle cooking .
kitchen	heavy machine , looked durable , almost commercial . put her together and began . within 5 minutes of use the belt for the rotating brush burned up and the brush no longer rotated ! returned it the following day and bought a bissel that has worked great , was cheaper and weighs less !
kitchen	i have used this for treaditional recipies as well as with different ethnic twists..korean bbq , seafood , italian roasted peppers , artichokes , etc.we have used potatoes bread for topping with goodies..the possibilites are truely endless.. the grill is easy set up , and easy clean up..very family friendly
kitchen	the product is everything as described plus . it stores alot of laundry , and wheels easy
kitchen	these pans are great , they are very sturdy and good quality . do n't buy anything else ! trust me
kitchen	after 6 weeks of waiting , customer service said it was going to be another 3 weeks ! forget it ! cancelled order
kitchen	we love this item , it 's easy for the kids and everyone who visits asks us where we found them . they look cute in the kitchen too !
kitchen	purples are most of the time hard to match , not with the fiestaware plum sugar packet caddy . the color matched just perfectly and all i could do is smile
kitchen	i loved these sheets when i first received them and would have written a glowing review then . however , now that i have washed them twice there is no sheen to them and every single inch on them is pilled . they look terrible but i have n't slept on them yet since they pilled so i do n't know how that will feel . hopefully it wo n't be noticeable . no one sees these sheets other than me and my husband , but i am very disappointed with these considering i 've had cheaper sheet sets for 8 years that have n't reacted this way . by the way , i ordered the set in chocolate and it is a nice color if brown is what you want . maybe it 's possible that certain colors pill and some do n't ? i have read other reviews that people said their sheets pilled also
kitchen	i 'd think if i were dyson , i would recall all of these . big , bulky pricey , and worthless . i thought turbines were designed to spin ? it certainly does not compare to the vacuum at all . bought a real one for $ 17 ( shiping included ) eureka power paw , dyson should be ashamed
kitchen	after remodelling our kitchen , i wanted to upgrade the look of items that would be sitting out . when i saw the picture of the towel holder , i thought it unique with its scroll-work and would n't look like everything else i saw . when i received it , the first thing i noticed was that the base had ugly black smudge marks on the area that would be visible . i tried with no luck to remove the stains . the area where the short post attaches screws in crookedly because the threaded receiver was set at a tilt ! all in all , i would not trust this company to have consistant quality in their workmanship
kitchen	i like a big mug of coffee , and the senseo coffee maker just does not have that much room under the spout . my tall mugs do n't fit , but these do perfectly . just a note for fellow senseo lovers
kitchen	i 'm certainly glad to have this pointer . you 'd never know it is inexpensive , since it looks quite sleek ( like a fountain pen , though heavier , for sure ) and casts a sharp beam quite a distance . pleasantly sensitive to the touch , it needs no fussing . you 'd have to have pretty specialized needs to want a more expensive model
kitchen	what a fabulous pillow and a great deal . they looked small until i unpacked them , then poof ! big fluffy pillows ! nice
kitchen	by far the best bang for the buck when it comes to non-stick pans . it 's already taken a beating and still looks like new with no scratches . it also cooks very evenly across the entire bottom surface .
kitchen	item worked for one year , three weeks . then had widely varing temperature readings , or indications that the oven had reached over maximum temperature ( 500+ degrees ) when oven was set for 325 degrees .
kitchen	my parents live in florida , so we got two of these and rechargable batteries for use in case of storms and power outages . the fan is very quiet when operating . i like the fact that it runs on batteries - great addition to the `` hurricane survival kit '' !
kitchen	i bought this coffee maker to try and get above the level of cheap coffeemakers . i did not succeed . i paid $ 50 and could have bought a $ 20 mr. coffee and saved myself a lot of my money . this is not a top of the line coffee maker with bottomline features ... . it is a bottomline coffee maker with bottomline features . it has no clock , no timer , no automatic turnoff ( it will cook the pot dry if you forget to turn it off . it is hard to fill to the correct level without having water run out the hole in the reservoir at the back . it is hard to pour a cup of coffee without cascades of dribbles . you are supposed to be able to take a cup out as it is brewing . in a word , `` do n't '' . it just keeps drooling coffee all over the heating element . and it takes forever to brew a pot of coffee . i am not an engineer , just a harried housewife that is trying to get everything together in the morning and get everyone where they need to go . this coffeemaker should have never made it to the marketplace . if you want a basic coffeemaker , get a mr. coffee for $ 20 , this is not what you are looking for . there is nothing `` deluxe '' about this coffee maker except the profit they are making off of consumers like me .
kitchen	i bought this sheet set , the newest blue comforter with the light saber duel , and the micro bead pillow as a christmas gift for my 9 year old son . he , too , loves star wars ... and as i read the other reviews , im nodding my head . these sheets feel like burlap ! i have washed them regularly since december ... with no improvement . they dont fade , though..which i suppose was the motivation behind the manufacturer making them with 70 % polyester and only 30 % cotton . very stiff and scratchy
kitchen	hopefully , i will never make this kind of mistake
kitchen	it 's a very secure for children . my daughter is happy with this produc
kitchen	i was a little skeptical because of the affordable price but i gave this set a try and love it . the pieces are heavy enough to maintain a consistant heat and are very durable . clean up is a breeze . i am very happy with this set and will be purchasing other pieces .
kitchen	the sewing machine , is built very cheaply , does not even sew correctly , i understand i didnot pay that much , but to feel you really are just ripping people off , its an item i ended up throwing out , for it just took up space
kitchen	worst product ever ... do n't know how it passed through initial testing . when you turn the crank to dispense cereal , it crushes it and sprays it all over the room . awful , just awful . too embarrassed to even give it away so put it in the trash . waste of money and space . and we tried dog food , which is too hard for it to crush so it just got stuck . really made me angry that i wasted the money . false advertising .
kitchen	a great quality french press that made bodum famous . simple , easy to clean and quick ! ideal for the times when you need a nice cup of fresh brew coffee but could n't find a coffee maker nearby .
kitchen	this is horrible at keeping coffee hot . it gets cold quick . buy another brand . i bought this model and a larger zojirushi 1.9 liter stainless steel model at the same time . they both are bad and leak heat vapor out like a hissing snake with no off switch . the 1.9 ltr one also leaks fluid out even before you press the open button . also it is the worst stainless steel i have ever seen . it stains instantly and for ever . i had another zhjirushi for more than a decade and it was fantastic . but something has happened over the last 10 years , their quality has really gotten bad
kitchen	i also have this fountian in black . i get a orange slime on my filter and the white residue on the slide part . i agree it is hard to tell if the fountain is dirty . the filters do not seem to last very long either . i have not even owned this for a year and the motor has broke . now i am attempting to find a motor to replace this one . i do not reccommend this color at all ! the fountian has been fine until now , but it should n't of broke down already
kitchen	i received this model as a gift and thought it would be great since we only brew a few cups at a time . however , as other reviewers noted , almost immediately the clock started losing several minutes every day . i was n't intending to use the delay feature very often so i did n't bother to return it . now , just short of a year after i received it , it suddenly started working , so i 'm shopping for a replacement . i might try another mr. coffee model with better reviews , but not this one
kitchen	i 'm looking for a timer . simple as can be . i should have listened to the previous reviews . this thing simply did not work right out of the box . it would `` catch '' at the 20 minute mark and just get stuck there . great . i would definitely not recommend this product
kitchen	corrected review : on september 1st , after using it five times to stir soft ice cream , i used this spatula to stir flour into oil and it broke with the steel stem sticking out . amazon emailed the promise to refund this product but i have n't seen the refund yet .
kitchen	table came with chipped wood on one leg . when put together , the chip got even worse . the table is horribly unsteady . would not recommend to anyone .
kitchen	first item came with the lcd display scratched under the protective film from the factory . yes from the factory . put a battery and it ran for exactly 15 seconds and died . tried a new battery , different brand etc . yup , dead . do n't buy this thing , i 've never seen worse quality in my life
kitchen	i bought these for a wonderful craft . i was expecting them to be decent , but i did not expect them to be as nice as they were . if i realized how nice they were , then i would of purchased several at the same time to save on shipping . i realize that i got 100 bags , but my craft took about 75 of them . they are nicer than the piping/icing bags that i used while i was learning cake decorating . when these are gone , i will definitely order more . the plastic is thick enough so you will not have to worry about your icing tip squeezing out .
kitchen	eeks mice are great ! most catnip mice lose their flavor/smell/attraction for my cats pretty quickly , but my cats still play with an eeks i 've had for over a year . the one drawback is that they do n't look too good after being played with ( teeth marks , drool stains , ripped-off tails , etc ) , but cats do n't care about that
kitchen	well after reading the reviews of this vacuum , i decided to give it a try . i have had it a month now and i have to say that i am sorry i bought this behemoth . right out of the box and trying it for the first time i noticed things that i did n't like . i thought i 'd give it some time though and hoped i could adjust . here is what i found : 1 . the vacuum is very heavy as other reviewers have stated . 2 . worse than the vacuum being heavy , the darn thing is really hard to push . even on hard smooth surfaces it 's hard to push . i have not figured out yet what the heck would cause it to have so much drag . for it to drag on hard surfaces , it must be a design flaw . 3 . the on/off power switch is foot operated . not a terrible thing but dirt devil decided to put the darn thing out of view and hidden by the accessory carriage . on my first time of vacuuming i accidentally ran over a sock and it got caught in the floor brush . while the brush belt was smoking i fumbled around for the damn power switch . i finally had to reach down and press the switch by hand because i could n't find it by looking down . it must have taking me eight to ten seconds to finally turn the thing off . unfortunately , the damage was done . the belt snapped . how nice . i really liked that . first time out and the belt snapped . another note about the switch ; there have been times i have had to repeatedly press the switch because it would not lock off . it takes a firm steady pressure to turn it off . the fun part of this annoyance is that you think you have it turned off because the motor starts winding down and as soon as you let up on it the motor powers up . couple that with not being able to really see the darn thing it 's a real challenge . maybe dirt devil thinks we have eyes on our toes . hey dirt devil here is an idea . how about putting the on/off switch on the push handle . what a novel idea . doh ! 4 . the vacuum hose that detaches is really unwieldy . it has a long plastic handle that you hold onto and that makes it really difficult to manipulate the hose . the main reason being is that the hose it too short . it 's like you are fighting the hose all the time . it gets tiring . 5 . the detachable hose is really hard to re-install in it 's port . you have to wedge it in there really hard to get the thing to seat . 6 . the vacuum is terrible on rugs , on any of the floor height settings . it bunches up the rugs and starts smoking baby . my old vac was not much better but at least with the old one i could lift the vac and kind of drag it over the rug and it would n't get all caught up . i tried the same thing with the dirt devil and forget about it . it jammed up every time . 7 . the vacuum is poor at getting dirt off of hard surface floors . it just moves the dirt around or spits it out the back . i have to use the hose attachment . 8 . the vacuum is horrible on steps . with my old vac i could drag the vac across each step whilst the vacuum is locked in the upright position . easy deal . the dirt devil does not work that way . when the vacuum is in the upright position the brush is too high off the carpet to do any good . the only option is to disengage the lock and vacuum with the back slanted . one little problem with that . the weight of the vac cause the seal at the base of the dirt canister to open and air begins leaking . you do n't get a good positive suction . so , you have to play with the position of the tilt to get the proper seal . the problem is that the proper position you need is so close to where the vacuum locks into the upright position . it often locks and so then you have to try and un-lock it while balancing this heavy behemoth . it 's a joke . the only half easy way to do steps is if use the detachable hose and attach the power brush . the only problem with that is you are fighting the ill designed hose and heavy vacuum , and not to mention that the brush attachment will only really get surface dirt . if you try putting pressure for some deep cleaning the brush stops . now for pros : 1 . the vacuum does seem to get the carpets pretty clean . it has good suction and it raises the carpet fibers right up . it almost makes my carpet look like new , and i do not see an excessive amount of carpet fibers in the dirt canister . some vacuums like to just tear up carpets . 2 . the rotating brush attachment works pretty good for removing cat hair off of couches and bedding . all in all this vacuum was very very poorly designed . i may just have to donate this thing and buy something else . i ca n't imagine fighting this thing every week for years to come or until the motor dies . maybe i 'll be lucky and the motor will die soon . then i 'll just throw the darn thing out and buy something other than dirt devil . steve
kitchen	i just got this thing 2 hours ago . in the middle of grinding a 16oz bag and it stops working . made it through about 8oz ... try again two hours later thinking motor got too hot , nope . number one , this is nothing more than a typical small `` hand held '' grinder with a few lights and a cup dial that does absolutely nothing . do not buy this . the others who wrote a positive review must have been lighting the bottom of a spoon before they tried using this thing
kitchen	i consider this coffee pot to be near perfect . it has no `` auto turn on '' feature , but i never use that anyway . the only thing that takes getting used to is the way the filter holder thing opens , but it soon becomes habit . my favorite feature has to be the water filter . it really improves the coffee flavor . it 's also compact . i gained a little more counter space
kitchen	i am extremely pleased with the anolon cookware set . it cooks evenly and cleans up beautifully . many of my friends recommended this set and i 'm glad to have taken their advice and made the purchase
kitchen	i grind beans for my coffee every morning . i was using a krups grinder and decided to switch to this quieter grinder ... sold the old grinder in a garage sale . i do regret buying this grinder . it is loud and takes 30 seconds to grind instead of 10 . my main complaint is that it is messy . the grounds stick to the sides and bottom and i have to smack it several times to get all the coffee out . i am tempted to purchase another krups before i break this one by beating the grounds out of it . also , coffee grounds are everywhere , i always have to use a cloth to clean up . not a good buy
kitchen	perfect size bowls for fruit and maybe a side dish for those of you who do n't like their food all running together on your plate . good for snacks like pudding and jello . also good for anyone who wants salad dressing on the side ~ nice and shallow for spooning out the dressing . plus it wo n't take up alot of space on your table . this is a very nice color
kitchen	look . i suck at using a normal iron . but , after reading some reviews decided to try a press out to decrease my dependence on dry cleaners . the results are pretty good . as i have gotten better using it the results have gotten better . plus , there are some fabrics and materials that iron much easier than others . i just did a couple of long-sleeve dress shirts and the results were good . not perfect , but good . as others have said , i wish it were bigger and wish the top plate opened higher and with the back hinge was farther back to give me more room to work with . but , once you understand the right method of doing it the back hinge is n't really a big deal . more height clearance would be nice , though . it wo n't be too long before it pays for itself . and , now i have no excuses when it comes to wearing clothes that are wrinkled ! plus , i 'm pressing my golf shirts which typically did n't look that good after being washed , but were too expensive to get dry cleaned ... i also just ironed an undershirt just for fun . now that was an easy shirt to iron . :
kitchen	i 've always been on a search to find the best coffee mug that includes all the features that serious coffee drinkers are looking for : 1 . keeps the beverage hot for hours . 2 . when sealed , it does not leak at all . 3 . easy to drink from and dribble-free . 4 . suitable for right and left hand drinkers . 5 . fits into most car cup holders . 6 . clips to straps/loops/handles to carry easily , even when filled . 7 . easy to clean and stays stain/smell free . 8 . rubber accents provide non-slip grips and does n't make a clanking noise when the mug is set down on the conference table . 9 . high quality construction for durability . 10 . it looks really cool ! this mug has with out a doubt ended my search for the perfect coffee mug . i look at all others now and laugh because they pale in comparison to this mug . finally , a company has created the ultimate coffee mug for even the most demanding user . this is a fantastic mug and is definitely worth the price
kitchen	this sharpner worked so well that i bought a second one to have when i wear this one out
kitchen	this pan is a good example of calphalon quality and the design is very versatile . start a saute on the stove , add ingredients , then put it in the oven for a quick roast or broil . i am also planning to use this to roast pork and chicken in the oven . the metal handles stay suprisingly cool , i have only had to use a potholder when getting it out of the oven . i hate washing dishes , but this pan cleans like a dream . the only thing i do n't like about it is the high price
kitchen	we have been searching for a solution to our very uncomfortable seats in our ford windstar van . this cushion did not help
kitchen	the larger of the bowls was broken when i recieved it so it was not packet very well . i have used the smaller bowl and loved it .
kitchen	i bought this because it was on sale and i wanted to try it . now i want to kick myself for not getting it sooner . this is a gaget worth having . my husband even loves it . it makes sweeping up after 5 kids and a dog a breeze . it gets plenty of use and it still going strong . it is very user friendly and so easy to empty .
kitchen	rapid , efficient , sturdy and easy to clean . must to attached to the edge of a counter and the right edge was hard to find . i hand pitted cherries for 90 minutes and completed the same number in 15 minutes with the cherry pitter
kitchen	i got this trash can to put on the counter next to my coffee maker for discarded sweet low packages . i love how it fits in with my black and stainless appliances . the item itself works pretty good for the most part . the only issue i have found with it is the lid fits loosely on the base and slides off when putting something in it . to remedy the issue , i am planning to drill a tiny hole in the sides and out a tiny hand screw on each side of the lid to hold it firmly in place . i 'm not sure if a review is the appropriate forum to mention that actually finding this item or one like it on the web was very difficult to locate . perhaps additional keywords can be added to the item to make it easier to find . i used search terms like `` mini trash can , '' counter top trash can , '' `` small waste basket , '' small stainless steel trash can , '' but none of these got me to this item . i 'm not sure how my husband finally found it .
kitchen	what people do n't think about is how hot chocolate works just as well as coffee in a coffee mug . i 'm not a coffee drinker but if this mug brings you great coffee joy you should also pour hot chocolate in it . i have to take a point off because after you pour coffee in this mug enough times a permanent smell is left there , which means using this cup for anything other than coffee or hot chocolate is gross . especially water . who wants to take a sip of water only to smell coffee every time you put the mug to your face ? not me . not that the smell of coffee is horrible or anything . it smells good and i ca n't imagine not smelling it every morning when other people in my home are making some . a great mug you should buy .
kitchen	this grill pan heats relatively evenly , and is large enough to accomodate four slices of bread , allowing for the preparation of two sandwiches simultaneously . it leaves nice `` grill marks '' on the food , and works well overall . the press that comes with it is very nice to have , as it helps cook food faster . however , it has one major drawback : it makes a very odd smell when it is used , regardless of the temperature at which it is being heated . i thought maybe this smell would dissappear after several uses , but even after many uses the smell is still as strong as the day i took it out of the box . it is enough of an odor to make me wonder about the safety of the product . i have a number of higher end calphalon non-stick pans and none of them make this smell , making me think this is a consequence of a cheaper pan . bottom line : if i had to do it over again , i would spend a bit more money and get a higher end calphalon grill pan and press instead
kitchen	these 'vino grande chardonnay ' glasses are less in volume and shorter in height than the spiegeleau stemware previously sold under the same name .
kitchen	if you want your wife mad at you buy this vacumn . a total waste of money and time ! ! ! poor suction , air filter is clogging constantly , filthy when you have to empty it , shuts down when it picked up a small piece of paper , have to unplug for 30 minutes . they lost their marbles when they designed this vacumn ! could not even give this thing one star , it is that bad ! ! !
kitchen	i bought one of these for my girlfriend ... then read the reviews ! in my opinion it appears to work fairly well . the sensitivity switch needs to be adjusted depending on personal usage . to the far left seems to work best for 'normal ' walking . as i said , in terms of accuracy , i think it 's pretty good . the radio portion of the unit is reason for the '4 out of 5 ' stars . the sound is `` tinny '' ; it 's not stereo ; there 's no frequency disply ; and the 'super-mini ' plug forbids you from using a better set of headphones ( earbuds ) because the actual plug is too small to accomodate the standard plug size ! though overall , when comparing price to features ... this little fella will probably suit your needs . if you already have a walkman ( or do n't care about audio ) the unit with the calorie counter would be a better bet
kitchen	we 've had this for about five years . the battery went dead but there is no way to change the battery . the battery is soldered to the circuit board ! they expect you to ship it back to the factory which will probably cost $ 20 each way ! i opened it up , cut out the old battery , and duct-taped a new battery in there but it just comes loose every few months . cooks rice great , though
kitchen	it is n't exaclty what i expected . but it works . it looks nice . and holds a lot of coats and does n't tip over . it serves its purpose . are there better quality coat racks ? yes . but for this price , its worth it
kitchen	i found this same item at a target store in stock for only $ 39.99 . they also have it for sale on-line for the same price . it 's a great chair
kitchen	poor quality , the cover leaks , i had to return it back , do not buy
kitchen	this coffeemaker 's design is flawed . but my customer service experience on complaining about it was the best i 've received from any company in years . they sent their new thermal carafe model , which appears to have the design flaw with the filter carrier taken care of . give them a chance to make it right . customer service is part of the equation with any purchase , and mr. coffee/sunbeam has impressed me on that score
kitchen	a collegue of mine raved about it -- she has several of the smaller model in her home and brought one in the office . i tried it for a day , but was not convinced either way . then , i bought the largest model , and tried it at home . i used it exactly as written in the instructions and put it to the `` acid test '' . i used it in the toilet room , closed the door , and let it sit there for 8 hours . when i inspected the room , i could still smell what i smelled 8 hours earlier . and i so wanted it to work ! the other thing that bothers me is that it is supposed to make the odors undectable to the human nose , but even the manufacturer does not claim that it actually removes the source of the odor ( as does a hepa air filter )
kitchen	i was cooking 5 strips of bacon on the platter in the microwave and the platter actually cracked in half ! i have cooked bacon on my other platters with no problem . this is dangerous and annoying . i could n't find sango customer service anywhere , therefore , had to return to retailer , etc .
kitchen	we bought this pad for our 2 year-old son 's twin bed and it was so nice that we later purchased one for our queen sized bed . it is soft and does n't crinkle and make noise like other pads we 've had . it also washes in the machine really well . we 've washed my son 's once a week since we bought it ( about 6 months ) and it has n't changed a bit , still appears to be in great condition . both the twin and the queen fit our mattresses well
kitchen	the kitchenaid kfpw760 is exactly as advertised . it has three nested work bowls . the inner , smallest one takes a special blade ( a smaller version of the standard processor blade ) . it 's perfect for pulverizing/mixing small quantities of things . pulling the used bowl out leaves the next one ready for use without having to stop and clean something . the same is true for the next one until you reach the largest , 12 cup bowl . a number of blades come in a well designed transparent and strong storage box ( finally , a way to keep everything together ) . the unit even has with a fruit juicer accessory that replaces the bowl . it 's the kind with the rotating hub ( two hub sizes are included , one for lemons and a larger one for oranges , etc ) . while it seems to work , it 's not as convenient as a low cost dedicated version such as the black decker , but what the heck , it 's worth trying . the motor is quiet and you get a real feeling of professionalism when using it . at first i was disappointed that there were n't any fancy front panel switch options , but after thinking about it , you only need the provided on , off and pulse . would i buy it again ? absolutely . would i buy it again from amazon ? again , absolutely . the transaction was without difficulty and the shipment actually came earlier than promised
kitchen	reasons : 1 . faulty battery cover design . the battery cover comes off time i remove the timer from a metal surface . 2 . the protective glass is cloudy - making the timer numbers hard to see . 3 . the alarms are not very audible . 4 . the magnet `` unglued '' itself within the first three days of use
kitchen	we received our sheet set and they felt like sateen , but when we washed them they lost the sateen feel . they feel like flannel . we are very disappointed with our purchase
kitchen	i picked up a dozen in home depot for less than $ 5 . same concept , just a lot cheaper ! two of them are holding a huge heavy shelf in my kitchen . the hole they make depends upon the weight of what they 're holding . i 'm sure it 's pinhole sized if you 're hanging something that weighs a few ounces ( in which case , you do n't need this - use a pushpin ! ) the holes from the shelf are bigger than pin-sized , but it is a heavy shelf . the hole is still way smaller than the hole i 'd make using any kind of a hook that would hold such a heavy shelf . it also takes a little practice to figure out where to hang the hooks ( the drop of the hook is below where you might want the thing to actually hang . ) this is a small detail , but if you need two of these things and you do n't do it right , your object is gon na be crooked . but on the bright side , you wo n't have a huge hole to patch when you redo it ! recommended product ( but look around for the knockoffs .
kitchen	we love the omega paw litter boxes to death , but when we got our first two we ordered these so we could have cute little matching sets and looking back we really should have spent that money to get a third box . our cats do n't like the paw cleaning side , they refused to walk on it . so we turned them over to at least collect some of the cat litter , but it still got everywhere so we ended up putting newspapers under the opening for each box and that keeps most of it off the floor . we leave the mats we have in place for cute value and because sometimes you can get away with just emptying those , but our new boxes are doing fine without them . the cats even seem to like to pee on the mat once in a while out of spite and then the cat litter melts and cements into the little groves . you might have better luck if you have less cats who are tidier and have less sensitive paws , but do n't buy more than one until you know for sure they can tolerate it
kitchen	very bad quality , not worth to buy it . it is not as good as the picture . do n't buy it ! !
kitchen	i am very pleased with my new salad spinner . it can hold a large amount of salad , which means i do not have to reload and do the work over and over . the mechanism is easy to use and works smoothly . i am also able to soak the salad in icewater in it , and then drain it and spin , all in the same piece of equipment .
kitchen	this knife along w/the matching 7 '' 5-star meat fork are my weapons of choice for carving leg of lamb , prime rib , ham , veal , turkey , etc ... at various carving stations at my job . i love the 5-star line have most pieces from it as well as 2 of this knife . i 'd recomend trying the 4-star pro-s line out as well before deciding on this line ( same blades , different handles ) . i 'd definately replace if lost/stolen . after using proper tools there 's no way you can go back to cheap knives . i 'd love to see a 12 '' version of this knife w/a wider blade
kitchen	this cute little casserole is great for making soups or casseroles for 2-4 people . i use it for my morning oatmeal , soup for lunch and casseroles for dinner . retains heat so foods stay warm.clean up is a breeze ! i have the green pepper but want the red and yellow one too
kitchen	this thing basically self destructed the first week . the handle pieces would n't stay together and when i pushed down on the handle to tighten the pieces together the base fell apart . not worth the money ! i was very disappointed
kitchen	i bought two of these humidifiers . one for work and one for home . they both broke in the first week
kitchen	the best buy i have ever found on 1000 count sheets ! they are excellent quality
kitchen	i purchased the ic70 ice crusher for my father for christmas who eats ice all day long . he loves it and pleased with its performance . i used it myself a couple of times and like it as well . i would recommend this product to anyone who wants crushed ice
kitchen	when i bought these pads at amazon last year , a 50-pack was $ 11.99 -- now its $ 26.99 ! does anyone know why this happened ? the pads themselves are fine and work beautifully with the pad holder , but i 'm protesting against this price
kitchen	this was the first item that i purchased on amazon . item was received in excellent condition , and in a very timely manner . very pleased
kitchen	i 'm a betta hobbist and i know about all the misconceptions that betta can live in just about anything and it is bogus . this `` aquarium '' is way too small , betta require atleast one gallon of water and that needs to be cleaned 1-2x weekly atleast . this is probably 1/2 gallon or less meaning you either clean it every day , t hus stressing your betta out and killing it or let is die a slow death from ammonia burns and other ills . this also has no lighting leave betta looking dull and boring , no heating or ability to heat so your house must stay warm where your betta is and it just is n't good . you can also buy large critter carriers ( 2-3 gallons ) for the same price or less , it would n't be great , but it 'd be a heck of a lot better
kitchen	i say nearly useless because the ceramic pot is a nice size and weight for melting chocolate in the microwave ( which is what you 'll have to do ) , and the warmer makes a decent trivet ... but , it does not ever get hot enough to actually melt the chocolate . we followed the directions , and allwed 1/2 hour for the chocolate to melt ( putting chips in as we started dinner ) . half an hour later , some of the chocolate ( on the outside of the crock , by the burner coil ) had melted a bit . an hour passed ... still nothing much . now , given that cocoa butter melts at body temperature ( which is why it is used in cosmetics ) , that 's saying something . the pot never reached 98 degrees ! if i 'd put the chips in a zip-lock in my lap during dinner i would have had better results . since this was a relatively inexpensive item , and i got it effectively for free during amazon 's recent valentine 's day promotion , i did not send it back ( thinking it would be unfair to make them pay shipping both ways on an item which costs near as much to ship as it does to buy ) ... but , if you are actually paying for this- do n't bother . ( or at least be advised that it will not actually melt the chocolate ) . it does do a reasonable job of holding the temperature once you 've melted the chocolate some other way .
kitchen	used for a month now , better than the others tried over 25+ yrs . for the remanufactured price , would buy it again if it lasts for a yr
kitchen	this cooks bacon crisp without any mess or spatter . just place a couple of paper towels over the bacon . i was using my george foreman grill , but this is easier to clean
kitchen	my boss wanted extra seating in my office for visitors . we ordered online but were a little worried . this loveseat was delivered very quickly , assembled in minutes and is so comfortable that my boss has decided to keep it in his office ! now i have to wait for another one - good thing it only takes a few days
kitchen	yep , i had some 20-year-old revere ware pots and this steamer fit my 2 qt pan with no problem . and the lid from the pan fit the steamer . it 's plenty big to steam two large sweet potatoes , and probably more . exactly what i needed and the price was good too
kitchen	i 'm please with my coat rack . i have several heavy jackets on it and it 's sturdy as well as attractive . i would recommend it , especially at the price
kitchen	we 've had this foam mattress topper for a couple of weeks and it 's ok but nothing special . it does not significantly improve the comfort of the bed , nor provide any improvements in sleep quantity or quality
kitchen	heats well and quiet . does not blow heat very forcefully but certainly warms sufficiently given enough time using the oscillation function . appears solidly built with good warranty
kitchen	saw a demo of this at a local sur la table and very impressed . the coffee it makes is outstanding . i plan to buy one later this year . amazon is being deceptive about price . they state list price is $ 2400 , and they 're selling it for $ 1798.95 , at a savings of $ 601.05 . not ! look at the jura-capresso website . the list for the impressa f9 is $ 1799 . that brings amazon 's big discount down to a whole $ 0.05 . the higher end impressa s9 is $ 2399 ( and amazon claims it is $ 3200 ) . do your research . do n't trust amazon 's claims for msrp
kitchen	ditto the other 's observations ... the thermostat seems to register the temperature of the unit itself rather than the room ... i had the thing in a 63 degree room , had it set to 85 degrees . it would register 90 after 30 seconds of running , turn off , slowly ramp back down to 84 degrees over a 2 minute time period , and then repeat . the temperature of the room never got above 64 degrees ... .
kitchen	looks great in my kitchen but i , too , only use it for shakes smoothies . it does smell like burning rubber nearly every time . i used to think something was wrong with it and now i just disregard it . and after less than two years or making smoothies , i 'm replacing the blade gasket assembly .
kitchen	when i first saw this dehumidifier i could n't stop laughing . this little bitty thing was supposed to tackle my moisture overload in a large storage shed ? i figured that something was better than nothing until i could buy a better ( bigger ) dehumidifier . i hooked the little one up and come back the next day to check out the progress and much to my surprise the little-bitty sucked up an inch of water ... in one night ! ! ! now i am so confident that this will do the job i will recommend this for anyone with a similar problem . the free shipping was a great plus as well ! !
kitchen	the writeup is incorrect . this does not fit all cuisinart 12 cup coffee makers , it definitely does not fit the dcc 1200 . while returning it is not difficult through amazon , it means a trip to ups and another 2 weeks of waiting for a correct replacement
kitchen	i 'm a big coffee drinker and i thought the bunn would be a coffee lover 's delight . it turned out to be my biggest nightmare . it takes a lot to set it up and get it started . if you make a mistake and close the cover before you have the pot in place , boy what a mess . it leaked out the bottom and was very large and heavy . took up way to much room on my counter . i dumped it after one week and bought a farberware coffee maker and it is just as good , if not better . it 's small , easy to run , and the coffee tastes great . deb in new hampshir
kitchen	i followed the instructions , many times , but still ca n't get the cork pulled out of the wine bottle . the oster wine opener cork-screw goes in just fine . however , instead of pulling out the cork , the cork-screw just reverses direction and comes out of the cork . i 'm 75 and bought this after reading a review on how great it was for older folks with arthritis . well , maybe i have a `` lemon '' but i certainly would love someone from oster tell me is i 'm doing something wrong . thank you for the opportunity to bring this to someone 's attentio
kitchen	i tried this thermal coffee press - delighted to see it was 1/2 the price of other thermal coffee presses - but in this instant you get what you pay for 1 ) the coffee does n't stay as hot as a regular thermos 2 ) when you press the grains down to the bottom they leak back up into the thermos and your last cup of coffee looks and taste like mud 3 ) its these times that you wish you bought the item in the store because now i have to pack it back in its box and send it back
kitchen	poor carafe design makes this mr. coffee machine a waste of money . we bought this model to replace our old mr. coffe machine after we broke the carafe and could n't purchase a replacement for that model . we loved our old mr. coffee , but this purchase was completely dissatisfying because , as other reviewers have noted , it 's virtually impossible to pour without spilling the coffee/water everywere . after the first few uses , we decided to purchase a different coffee maker
kitchen	i bought one of these in august of this year . i used it daily to make a ham/egg/cheese/english muffin sandwich every morning with great results . however , after about a month , the non-stick coating started to bubble then peel off from the egg poaching pan . i called back to basics and had a new pan free of charge within a few days . the new pan has been in use for two months without issue . the people at back to basics were very kind and shipped my new pan without hassle . some people reviewing this product have complained about the stainless steel water boiler becoming dirty from minerals and scalded meat juice . others have complained about the egg being soaked in water from steaming and/or sticking in the pan . i have overcome these problems by doing the following : i bought a gallon of distilled water that i use in the water compartment ( at an ounce or two per use , a gallon will last a long time ) . this prevents any mineral buildup and keeps the cooking cycle time to a minimum ( keeping the stainless steel clean keeps heat transfer to a maximum , therefore speeding cooking time ) . every three or four uses , i wipe the water compartment with a damp paper towel to remove any accumulated debris that may have dripped down . after cooking everything , i remove the egg poaching tray and while holding the egg in the tray with a plastic fork , tip it on its side over the sink to drain off any accumulated water , then remove the egg with the plastic fork . i use store-brand spray oil and have never had an egg 'stick ' in the pan . i have found that if i want toast/an english muffin/a bagel to be pretty crispy , i have to run it for two toaster cycles . all in all this is a great product . butter consumption in my house has decreased dramatically , and i 'm not making a huge buttery mess on the stove every morning . plus there no dirty spatula and frying pan to deal with every day .
kitchen	first off , i paid $ 25.00 for this at walmart , so i would suggest going there first if you decide you want this light weight vacuum . at the time of this writing amazon is selling it for $ 54.00 . secondly , it works fine for the amt of money i spent . thirdly , my biggest problem is the thing is so loud that in order to use it , i will have to put ear plugs in . seriously , this product makes about as much noise as a fire alarm ! ! i have an email in to eureka.com because their 800 number did not have this vacuum as an option on their automated voice mail and i was disconnected for trying to reach a human being to speak to
kitchen	the detector was simple enough to use , although it required alot of batteries ( 8 ) . but the results were mixed . urine markings were faint and hard to distinguish from other organic substances . even in areas where i knew there had been an accident , it was difficult to spot the difference . all in all , i generally would n't recommend this . ( although it did clearly show a distressing amount of what i believe is mold in the bathroom . )
kitchen	i bought this pan and to my suprise i had to assemble the handles on the skillet and the lid . the handles on the skillet were not bad at all but the lid ... . anyway , after i got it assembled , wash , and dried per the instruction manual i plugged it in a began cooking . it was amazing-my chicken came out beautiful ! two days later i was cooking and the thing went out on me ! it became cool to the touch . i left it alone for a while thinking maybe i did something wrong-but i was already cooking at a low temperature . it did not come back on when i replugged it in . hence i had to give it back . i was so disappointed . i am just glad it did not happen while cooking the feast i had planned for the following week . save your mone
kitchen	the unit is hefty and nice looking but that is about all nice i can say about it . the grind was no better than from the $ 20 burr mill it was replacing . on the third use the motor burned up . i also had problems with it making a mess when removing the jar -- such a defect should never have left the factory since it is so obvious
kitchen	this juicer is extremely heavy , made of industrial type metal parts , but it 's poorly machined and assembled . the heavy parts do n't fit together well , and the juicer is wobbly and unstable , despite it 's heaviness . i am sending this back without using it once , becuase there 's no way to adjust the parts , and it 's too unstable to use as is . also , it really is almost impossible to pick up and move , due to the weight , without straining your back . finally , like a reviewer of the orange-x large-size juicer , i find the industrial chemical smell of the parts unpleasant , and the enamel paint is chipped and scratched in many places . it seem like the kind of company where to get a good product , you 'd have to go to a store and look through several boxes to try to find an undamaged one
kitchen	superior product , great tasting expresso ( rivals starbucks ) , and very reliable . i have owned the granos for about 6 months and have found it to be a pleasure . it is easy to use and makes a top quality cup of expresso . the style of the unit is also unique and has generated much conversation with house guests . if you want a reliable expresso machine that makes a great straight shot or latte , i ca n't recommend the granos more highly . i plan to buy another for my office
kitchen	i bought this sauce pan last week . the quality is very good . the handle design is quite comfortable . i tested the even heat distribution by broiling the water and watched the water bubbles forming at the bottom of the pan . i found no hot spot . it responded to the change in the heat setting is average . it 's kind of heavier than all-clad ltd for the same size of pan . i 'm not sure about how long it will last under the normal daily usage yet . for the initial impression , this calphalon one non-stick cookware can stand up to the more expensive cookware such as all-clad - ltd , stainless steel , mc2 . look for the bargain . it 's worth the cost
kitchen	it seemed like it would be a great way to store cereal but it made more of a mess than it was worth . it spit cereal all over the place . i used special k and kashi granola cereal so it may work better if you used it to store something soft like oatmeal or gummy bears ! i returned it
kitchen	we had our kitchen gutted and completely redone . i built a knife holder to use in a drawer . now , with the wusthof 25-slot , i have removed my home-made holder . the drawer can be used to store other items . i can fit a huge assortment of the knives we have been using for several years . there is no need to buy a lot of new knives . just use a sharpener and keep those old friendly knives . having the knives up on the countertop makes them much more accessible and therefore easier to select and use . you ca n't go wrong with this super storage block
kitchen	i really like the look of the toaster , and it does a nice job ; on one side . the toasting elements on one side in each slot do not fully heat up so it toasts one side more than the other - will be trying to get it repaired , or likely , will have to get a new one .
kitchen	how does it create space ? if you have a cabinet that is 12 inches high , 15 inches deep and 14 inches wide , and put this large plastic item inside it , will that give you more space or take it away ? the manufacturers must not be very logical or are trying too hard to sell you something you do n't need .
kitchen	this color is a bit too bright , but the bag it very comfortable
kitchen	i burned up countless lesser spatulas before i found this one . try as i might , i can not damage it . not even in cast iron cookware . get one and see for yourself
kitchen	after reading all of the positive reveiws and only a few negative ones i purchased this humidifier back in dec. well here it is early feb and this thing just plain sucks . i have a digital humidistat sitting right next to it in a med size room ( 13x13 ) and it never reaches higher that 29 % . in the dry months of winter 29 % is unacceptable , and my eyes nose and throat would agree . so do n't do what i did , and save your money . or if you must try it , just be prepared to send it back or donate it to goodwill . enjoy
kitchen	i found this knife set to contain the sharpest knives out of the box of any knives that i have ever bought . they hold an edge well and have a good balance . the integrated bolster adds to the controllability of the knives . the only problem with the set is the steel hone . i find it is too course to be used except on the dullest knife . that is the only detractor from the set
kitchen	this filter is not , in my estimation , any good . it leaves a sediment , and the end product , the coffee , tastes terrible . use paper filters insted for a great cup of coffee
kitchen	using frozen fruit to make up to 4 smoothies every day , our family is hard on blenders . after more than a year of daily experience with the waring pro ( both mbb* pbb* models ) i can not recommend them for serious smoothing making . here 's why : both glass- stainless-jug models use the same blade assembly . this blade assembly wears poorly when asked to blend frozen fruit . it fails often , and must be rebuilt or replaced . parts are easily purchased if you 're handy and have the correct tools . details : the assembly screws together , and is threaded to tighten under use rather than loosen and fall apart . but this tightening action is so great when the blade contacts frozen fruit , that it bends the metal washer below the blade . the assembly eventually becomes so tight that the shaft can not turn . the waring pro is all the blender than many people will need , but is not sufficient for the daily maker of multiple smoothies
kitchen	these glasses are very cheap . i sent everyone of them back . when i recived them 2 were broken . they are very thin
kitchen	we run an informal barn cat rescue . this winter the temperature has been quite cold and our barn cats love the slumber mats in their little shelters . i could n't believe that they would work so well , but they do
kitchen	these bowls have been in my home for a few years now . we have used them for cereal in the morning for warming up food in the microwave . they are nice looking and very functional . when we needed another bowl when one broke , we knew we would get another fiestaware bowl
kitchen	this claims to be 100 % cotton , but my girlfriend who is n't allergic to cotton broke out in insane hives all over her body . we figured it was the blanket because we did n't use it on some days and one day it was horrible , she was using that only . it 's probably cursed by the devil . aside from this , it 's nice , soft , and also light enough to use as a summer blanket , which i plan on doing .
kitchen	when i adopted a cat a couple of weeks ago , two of my good friends highly recommended fresh step premium clay cat litter . here 's why -- this fresh step premium clay cat litter is excellent for your favorite kitty 's litter box . the company states that it is very good at absorbing odors -- and , by golly , it 's true ! the odors are minimal at the very most and it is quite comfortable even for my rather sensitive cat . moreover , i really like how the litter has the capacity to absorb and prevent odor causing bacteria in the litter before my cat even uses his litter box . that 's a plus for any cat lover ! if you have more than one cat the manufacturer does recommend , not surprisingly , that you use more cat litter in the box . otherwise , if you have just one cat , two or three inches worth of this cat litter spread about evenly throughout the empty litter box will do fine . you should change the entire litter box once a week on average . ( i change mine about twice a week just for my cat 's comfort . ) it 's also a good idea to scoop out any `` kitty remains '' every other day or so . be very certain not to flush any `` kitty presents '' down the toilet as the manufacturer warns against this . i suppose it could clog toilet pipes . moreover , as you may suspect , any `` kitty leftovers '' could have some nasty germs that we do n't want so wash your hands really carefully after you clean the box or even after you just remove any `` kitty presents '' with a scooper . the fact that this is clay litter helps because you can use a very inexpensive litter scooper to remove any `` kitty presents , '' thus reducing the number the times you need to change the entire kitty litter box . nevertheless , i recommend changing the entire litter box at least once a week . place the contents of the used litter box into a trash bag and discard as you would any other garbage . in short , this is a great cat litter product at a great price . the contents of the bag last a long time , especially if , like me , you have only one cat . the manufacturer also offers customers ( us , not the cats ) an `` awards '' program with points that you can accumulate in your `` account '' with the company on the company internet website . a nice plus ! ok , fresh step -- i thank you ; my father and mother thank you ; and , most importantly , my cat says thank you ! ! ! smiles
kitchen	i bought this coffee maker about 2 years ago . used 2 x daily and cleaned every month with either vinegar or special cleaner . unfortunately it began leaking water from outside top of machine . very poor quality machine .i just threw mine out in the trash bin . just got tired of constantly having to mop up after it . do n't buy this coffeemaker- a waste of good money ( i paid $ 99.99 )
kitchen	this little franciscan apple dinnerware creamer is so beautifully made . there is a matching sugar bowl and lid , too . i do not use mine to hold cream or half-and-half on an everyday basis because i would have to keep it covered with saran wrap so the liquid would not absorb any refrigerator odors . however , i do love to use it when i use my franciscan apple coffepot or when entertaining at a dinner party . there is also a small milk jug , and there are two other larger pitchers in the apple pattern . i have also used the apple creamer as a server for sauces
kitchen	my dog loves this toy . she especially loves for us to hide treats inside it . she will find a way to remove the treats without taking any of the squirrels out
kitchen	i could not believe the condition in which this rolling pin arrived . when i opened the bag around the pin one handle fell off . when i looked at the pin i noticed huge dark gouges in the wood pieces that make the ravioli . i thought that was bad enough but when i turned the pin over there was a huge chunk out of one of the wood pieces . needless to say , it 's useless . this was my first experience with amazon and it will be my last
kitchen	short and not so sweet : first unit did not work at all , second unit worked for about 3 months , then sporatically , then quit . i should have believed the other reviewers . going to try the senseo supreme unit now
kitchen	i placed my first order for the red casserole in march . it was not slated to be delivered until may ! but , i waited patiently for it . in may i see that it has finally been shipped and delivered to my house , but i never received it . so they send a replacement . and it is white , not red . and apparently they no longer have red
kitchen	not too happy with this small pizza stone -- before i ordered this one for a long time i had a set of flat bricks in my oven that were made for pizza baking and bread baking . i couldnt find these bricks again -- i had them for a long time and they were cracked and hard to clean by now but they were so much better than this small round stone ! my bricks made my pizza crust so crispy -- and this stone is a poor substitute for this ! my bricks were square and made a beautiful large square on my shelf -- if anyone knows what i am writing about -- pls email me and let me know where these set of bricks can be found and their name ! i am not happy with this pizza set-the rack is of no use -- the pizza cutter is a cheap one -- they really should put the money into making a better product than giving extras
kitchen	i bought 2 of these and they are so soft and comfy . i love these blankets . they are so superior to other blankets in their price range . the main reason i bought them was the price ; the colors are very nice too
kitchen	this pan was a bargain that turned out to be overpriced . i have a number of farberware pans that have served me well , but this one came out of the box warped . the first time i put it on the range top it was rocking like crazy , with only one strip through the center that made contact . i could return it , but for $ 10 it is not worth the argument with amazon about restocking fees . so after one use it is now washed and packed up in the goodwill box . i would never use it again .
kitchen	the price seemed great and i really liked the modern look . when i took it out of the box got disappointed by how cheap everything looked . assembly was very easy - it took my boyfriend about 15 minutes ( the most ) . the design is really great - it 's very compact , perfect for small spaces and would look awesome if materials were a little bit better . great idea - poorly executed . would gladly pay a lil more for this futon if it was a better quality product . my main concern is that the construction seems like it would n't last too long . i feel like i should attach `` sit carefully '' tag to it before anybody comes over
kitchen	cute bookshelf -- looks goods and serves its purpose . however , the tips of it that screw together break really easily . we were using it at trade shows where we put it up and took it down once a week ; it only lasted through 3 shows . two tips snapped off the last time we unscrewed it , even though we put very little weight on it when it was in use , and no weight or funny angles on it when unscrewing . probably would work well if you never plan to take it down , but i 'd question how much weight it can hold over a long period of time
kitchen	i bought this item brand new and in hot pink colored ( caught my eye ) . flashy , small cool looking ! however , it contains 1 led light which is bright but not wide spread . so when reading it lights up only the center of the page . you will have to constantly reposition it to keep from straining your eyes . the constant bending and reposition will affect the fragile wiring on this thing . about 10-15 uses after buying this product , i noticed a flikering ( very annoying ) . it slowly worsens the more i used it . in fact , i put the thing away and have n't used it again b/c of the annoyance . thank goodness i did n't pay much for it . value for the money is about a `` 7 '' because you get what you pay for . spend the money and try something else with more than 1 led in it . my next bet is finding something with a real light bulb in it or maybe i will just annoy my husband at bed time and read with the lights on :
kitchen	for the cheap price ( on sale i think it was $ 5 ) i paid on it , it is pretty good quality and is soft . if
kitchen	as a person who loathes cheap , clutter , infomercial widgets i bought this out or sheer curiosity imagining it would be returned the same day . this opener is large , requires an electric plug and takes up counter space . but to my surprise it works amazingly well . there is a foil cutter that is stored in the base . the screw enters cleanly and seems to eliminate broken and shredded corks which can be frustrating . hold the button again and the cork emerges from the device and drops out . i always liked my sturdy and simple stainless steel opener . but this turned out to be a keeper . it 's design is contemporary and clean , although it looks like it should do something more profound than just pull a cork . it 's also a conversation piece provoking smiles from guests . a pleasant surprise , highly recommended and especially so for a person who lacks hand or wrist strength .
kitchen	the picture on the website really does n't do them any justice . they are beautiful and tough , and i 'm so glad i got them
kitchen	i have had this unit for 8 months and have n't had any problems . it has ground my coffee fine enough and not cracked . i have not experienced a problem with it being too fat to hold with one hand , and i have very small hands . some of the coffee does stick to the inside but is easily removed with a spoon or napkin
kitchen	these cups are high quality stainless steel . do n't worry about putting thorugh the dishwasher or leaving in a sink . i was surprised by their weight and long handles . my old measuring cups were of much thinner steel and over time this lead to dents and deformation of the cups . these miu cups are extremely sturdy . the handles on my old cups were more typical too , while these miu cups all have very long handles ( ~4.5 '' ) . at first i did n't like the asthestics of the handles , nor the fact that the smaller ones do n't stand up on their own due to the imbalance this creates . however , when i needed to scoop something out of a small-mouthed container , i quickly reversed my opinion of these handles . cricisms : the interior has perpendicular corners . i prefer a slightly rounded interior corner for ease of cleaning and emptying . still , it does n't make much of a difference . also , while they 're not hard to store , they do n't stack all that well , so they 'll probably take up more room in your drawer unless you have tall drawers ( ~5.5 '' ) . i suppose because they were designed for cooking utility over storage ease . ( ... ) for the 5 cups , i 'm extremely satisfied . i feel these are top of the line . the 7 cup set is overpriced ( ... ) , so definitely go with these . i do n't understand why you would throw them away becuase you wanted the 2/3 and 3/4 cups ? just use the 1/3 cup twice or the 1/4 three times ... or eyeball the 1 cup . ( ...
kitchen	i recently purchased this set after spending several weeks trying to decide which set was right for me . not a chef , just a regular guy who likes to cook . i looked at several competators and decided that , for the price , this set was the best one out there . i 've had the opportunity to use most of the knives at this point and i find that they keep their edge very well and are extraordinarily easy to clean up . they have a nice heft to them and the handles seem to be just the right size . the only drawback that i see is that i would have preferred an 8 chefs knife instead of the 6 that comes with the set . overall excellent for the price and an absolutely sufficient set for novice
kitchen	exactly what i wanted . item as pictured and arrived in a timely manner
kitchen	the first time i used it i could n't even boil water in it on my flat surface stove ! a notice that came with it said , `` this pot may not work on all stoves , refer to the owners manual . '' ( no owners manual was sent with it . ) as soon as the water started to heat , the pot danced and wobbled all over and the water was sloshing out of the top ! nothing in the web site ad referred to the pot not working on a flat surface . it would have been nice to have known before ordering , as i am not a pro cook and have no special knowledge of these details
kitchen	i received my bowls today and was very disappointed . how bowls this size can be referred to as `` mixing '' bowls i can not fathom . neither do i know what could be mixed in bowls so small . the second from the largest bowl is about the size of a normal cereal bowl . the bowls nest so the largest bowl holds the `` cereal '' bowl and the next to the smallest bowl nests in the cereal bowl . the smallest bowl is a joke . i doubt it would hold an extra large egg without running over . the material is nice ... melamine ... and colorful but those are the only positive statements i can make
kitchen	this purchase came with 3 stackable racks - i thought it was only one rack . it stores very easily in a compact space and works well . i do n't know if it rusts since i have only wiped the tray with a cloth after using it
kitchen	the way this steamer was advertised , i really thought it gave out alot of steam , and lasted a decent amount of time . i tried it a few times and was very disappointed . i returned the item
kitchen	i 've owned one for five years and my knives are razor sharp . it took me a little practice before i realized i was using it correctly , though . the directions could be better , and the machine does n't provide any feedback to distinguish proper sharpening . _cooks illustrated_ magazine found that they could get knives sharper with this device than with the higher end models
kitchen	this hamper is okay , but amazon was very irresposible in how they shipped it . i ordered four , and all four shipped the same day from the same warehouse . how did they arrive ? in four giant shipping boxes ; each one contained one hamper and about 3 cubic feet of air filled plastic bags ! it took me 20 minutes just to break down the boxes and the plastic bags . i live in the city where recycling and trash space is scarce , and this really an insult to me and to the environment . there is nothing fragile about a compressed laundry hamper . according to the packing list , the shipping cost on each was $ 6 , which means that due to supersaver , amazon was skinning their shareholders to the tune of $ 5 per hamper . amazon , shame on you , you could have shipped all four in a large envelope !
kitchen	my 5 year old daughter loves this vacuum the only proble it does n't hold a charge i charge it over night and maybe lasts 15 min can anyone help ... .
kitchen	i purchased this coffee maker and in three months time , threw it out . what a piece of [ ... . ] . you can never get a decent hot cup of coffee ( it is lukewarm at best ) and the carafe not only breaks , so you have to replace it , but it is designed to spill coffee everywhere as you attempt to pour coffee from the carafe into the cup . what a dissapointment this machine is . mr. coffee used to make a good product that would actually make a good hot cup of coffee , but the quality and design of their machines today are very poor . i would not recommend this coffee maker to anyone . the only nice thing i can say about it is the programmable timer worked . i would not give this coffee maker one star , but that was the lowest rating available . if it were up to me , i would give this coffeemaker a minus zero rating !
kitchen	i ordered this product 3 months back - as they say `` got into the line '' . this item was part of an larger order so i could have gotten free shipping . now i get an email from amazon stating this item has been cancelled as it was further delayed and as i did not respond to thier email for extending the wait time . i never got an email and now as the remaining items have been delivered - if i need one then i will end up paying shipping too . amazon is normally good about these things - how can they still have it listed on the site when they are cancelling orders in the pipeline
kitchen	the lid drops in half the time you 're trying to put it on . the first six meals or so smell `` bad '' ( spoiled ) as they are cooking.. i think it 's the sealing ring ! what a god-awful smell for a kitchen
kitchen	i 'm really happy with this shoe rack . i 'd like it to be a little bit taller , but it holds the shoes very effectively and fits well in my closet . i 'd definitely recommend it
kitchen	i have just opened the three sets and they are beautiful . they arrived in perfect condition and i can not believe how fast the delivery was . a perfect addition for our dinner table
kitchen	these colorful and furry little mice are great for cats that enjoy chasing small toys . they are treated with catnip , but to be honest , i do n't think my cat knows the difference . unlike their zanies furry mice counterparts , zanies rainbow mice also rattle , since they have tiny pebbles inside them . a word of caution about this though : the pebbles are encased inside a semi-rigid plastic cartridge ( which makes up the body of the mouse ) . the furry fabric is simply wrapped around this plastic piece and glued . after my cat played with one of the mice , the fabric unglued itself and the plastic was exposed . since there are pebbles inside , unsupervised play might not be very safe . it 's best to regularly check the condition of the mice after the cats play with them . other than that , these are great toys and the price/quantity/quality ratio is pretty good . quantity is important here , because , due to their small size , most mice will most likely end up lost behind some piece of furniture . since you get 60 mice in this package , you can just keep replacing the ones that go missing in action . in the long run , it 's a lot cheaper than buying them individually
kitchen	this is not even a toy . do not waste your money on this item . amazon will charge you to send it back which is what most will do if you expect even the lowest standards in a `` quick '' machine . nothing about this machine functions well . never got an even stitch or a complete row of stitches . amazon should not carry this item , it has lowered the quality of amazon 's products in my view
kitchen	these are more like 200-250 thread count . soft at first , but after a couple of washings , they feel rough , loose their shape , and wrinkle easily . i purchased several different colors in twin and king sizes and all have been a disappointment .
kitchen	i am sure there is a lesson in my experience . i fist purchased the salt and pepper grinding mill balls and found the salt/pepper did not go where i wanted it . i also found that in order to get a reasonable amount out of the grinder i had to select the maximum coarse setting and over a period of six months the efficiency became so bad i finally threw them away . based on a salesmans advise i purchased the dual grinder thinking my problems might be isolated to the shape of the feed tube . i am sad to say that i again found it 's performance to be a big disappointment
kitchen	when trying to decide if this model ( 3670g ) was the right vacuum for me , i found a considerable amount of confusing information regarding it 's features on the internet..and from the manufacturer itself . first of all , many online retailers flat out state ( inaccurately ) that this model has a `` hepa '' ( high efficiency particulate air ) filter and at least one of the reviews for it here on amazon ( at least as of this writing ) seems to indicate that it has one as well . i can tell you outright that having checked with the manufacturer directly and now owning one myself that it does *not* have a `` hepa '' filter . more on that a little later in this review however . i found another confusing aspect of the description is in the model number ( i.e . 3670g ) . be careful to understand the difference between what amazon calls the 3670 ( also called the 3670a in some places ) and the 3670*g* models . they look identical and appear to be identical ( both are yellow and black ) however the 3670 only has a 9 amp motor and the 3670g has the larger , 12 amp motor . amazon carries both models and i almost ended up buying the smaller one thinking it was the same vacuum . for only about a $ 5- $ 10 difference in total price , i 'm not sure why the smaller version is even offered . it only seems to confuse the matter . the 3670 also does *not* have the `` hepa '' filter incidentally . i found the 3670g to be an excellent value however and am pleased with my purchase . it is compact , very powerful and great for my needs . the noise ... while high ... is quite tolerable and not at all excessive considering how well it cleans . the generously long cord wraps easily around the base for storage and while a retractable cord would have been extremely useful , not having one is a reasonable trade-off in keeping the price down . the blower port feature is very handy for cleaning my computer insides ( by blowing away dust without contacting electrical components as vacuuming would risk doing ) . the 3670g *does* require bags . it is not a `` bagless '' model however and while some may prefer a bagless model , i preferred a model that used bags . the bags are very easy to change on this model and not that much of an additional expense for what i consider to be the additional convenience ( of being able to easily remove and dispose of a bag ) . the only reason i gave this model 4 stars and not 5 was because i did not find the attachment brushes quite adequate . three attachment tools are included , a crevice tool , a 10 '' floor tool and a combination tool with a triangularly-shaped brush ( about 2 '' wide ) on the end . the combination tool also flips over to double as brushless pick-up ( 3 '' wide ) . in my opinion , this cleaner badly needs a mid-sized brush and/or pick up tool that is about 4-5 '' wide . the 2 '' wide combination tool brush does concentrate the suction into a small area for high power but being only 2 '' wide , i found that i simply had to move it much too frequently on larger surfaces ( such as a wall for example ) in order to cover the area needed . i would have rated this vacuum 5 stars if a brush about 4-5 '' wide had been included . as it is , i am searching for an optional brush that size to purchase extra . finally , a comment about the `` hepa '' filter . some people ( particularly those with allergies or who need extremely dust free air ) may want cleaners that include this item . in my case , i did not want this since i do n't need it and `` hepa '' filters can be quite expensive to change and replace ( unless you get a washable one ... also expensive ) . since many online descriptions i found were unclear whether the 3670g included this filter ( some descriptions flatly stated that it does ) , i found myself calling the eureka customer service number to find out for sure . it turned out that even eureka 's own customer service representative was unsure whether it contained the filter or not and had to take some considerable time to find out that it did n't have one . if you *do* want the `` hepa '' filter , you would want the 3684d ... which looks the same but is red in color , slightly more expensive , and has more and better quality attachments as well as the `` hepa '' filter . by the time you add in the cost of an optional additional attachment ( which i mentioned earlier that i think is needed on the 3670g ) , you are at the price of a 3684d . in that case , the 3684d may well be a better value for you , particularly if you like the `` hepa '' filter . overall , i think `` the boss '' series of canister vacuums is a great product . eureka ( and amazon as well ) needs to do a much better job of clarifying the differences between the particular models in the series however .
kitchen	pan received wil not be pan pictured . pan will look like kaiser bakeware nobless 7-inch springform pan , model # 751603 . pan sent will have correct item # 51842 on label from nordicware .
kitchen	i thought i was getting a set of forks not one fork . the picture and description are deceptive . the picture depicts a set ( s ) i am sure the one fork i got is great but i have 5 other hands that need a fork as well
kitchen	if this is in a jade or perhaps brick ... other earth colors , let me know . why waste everyone 's time with such a lame description
kitchen	does what it claims to , elegantly , but small leaf particles get through the filter . takes time for tea to brew
kitchen	i 've been using these for a couple of months and every nasty , gloppy mess i throw in it , including shortening , butter , cream cheese , sour cream and others have slid right out and cleaned up perfectly fine . i spend less time cleaning up then i would have with glass as more is pushed out . i have n't had any problems with them sticking and have yet to find a complaint with one and have gone so far as to aquire a 1 cup version . they both sit out and are never put away as my glass measuring cups are
kitchen	my wife and i are tired of cleaning up after our 4 cats . though the catgenies are terribly expensive to purchase and to keep stocked with sanisolution and granules , it would be worth it for more free time and a cleaner basement . unfortunately , they just do n't work . becuase we have 4 cats we bought 2 catgenies . even with 2 of them it was more than the machines can handle . even when we ran them right after the cats made their deposit the impeller was never able to grind up the turds properly . they clogged everytime and beeped incessantly . another problem is the scoop . even though it scoops 3 times for every cycle , it always left turds behind . those turds would then go through the whole cyle , which includes drying . that means that , even if they 're scooped up the next time it cycles , they 're going to be so dry and hard they 'll never be ground up properly . again , this results in clogs . we had them for a little over 2 weeks . in that time we had to run extra cyles , backflush and even take them apart and clean them . this product results in far more work , not less
kitchen	this whisk is very nice , and feels very comfortable and sturdy in hand . one thing i had n't foreseen , however , is actually pretty obvious . the silicone does n't slide very well along most surfaces , so trying to whisk along the bottom of a bowl or pan is a little difficult due to the friction . it is exactly as advertised , though , and i am very happy to have it
kitchen	we have some pretty nasty water from the tap , but this pur filter system makes it taste so good . i like that it fits in the fridge and actually holds about 10 large glasses of water at once . the hand held ones i 've used hold about 3 . i do n't know how pure the water is , but it sure tastes great .
kitchen	very hard to put together , drawers came broken both times- cute though- not at all sturd
kitchen	i bought one of these twenty years ago and it took this long for it to finally stop working . i find it easy to insert the cans . it works great if you follow the directions . it 's not made to support the cans you must cradle the can as it goes around . cleaning is simple because the blade and all pops out so you can stick them in the dishwasher or the sink . it 's a good buy
kitchen	after reading every review on deep fryers i could find , i finally decided on this one . it has been great and i could n't ask for anything better or more easy to use . i put it on my cooktop and let my big hood suck away any odors . it heats up quickly and the food has always come out great . we made donuts after cooking shrimp and halibut with no cross-odors or tastes ! my family only tolerates fish , so this was greatly appreciated . cleanup is easy also . after waiting for the oil to cool , the pan , lid and rack can go into the dishwasher . only the heating element has to be cleaned by hand and it is quite easy . the oil can be used many times without problems and so it is more economical to use than i originally thought it would be . i would recommend this with no caveats
kitchen	there is no substitute for le creuset 's ability to distribute heat evenly , withstand heat without staining , and to top it off , it 's soooo easy to clean ! worth every penny
kitchen	i bought this hoping to wow my family with some 30 minute meals but this does n't work great on my electric stove . if you leave it up too high for longer than a minute on the grill side the griddle coating burns off and stinks up the place . if you ca n't leave it up high you do n't get good grill marks . i end up putting on high for a few minutes and then back down . does n't cook thick meat for chicken breast through well . you are better off finishing them in a real pan in the oven . the coating chips easily . i am thinking of going with cast iron as it is more work in the begining but i think it worth it in the long run
kitchen	this knife block is a must for any miracle blade 3 owner . it fits _all_ the knives in the original set plus the four bonus all purpose knives included with the block . holds 14 knives plus kitchen scissors in a neat , compact , counter saving block . it 's a perfect
kitchen	as stated before in many a review , this machine is the best deal for the money . paired with a real espresso grinder ( which will unfortunately cost more than the machine itself ) this machine is capable of producing real espresso . my father bought this for me for my birthday back in december , and the machine is still in working condition . my only real beef with this machine is the wand . i can live with the lack of flexibility of where you can put the pitcher , however , the black turbo frother and the piece that holds it onto the wand fall off . right into my milk . i have taken to using the wand without either of them on , but this is n't optimum for latte foam . the only other thing that bothers me is that i have to hold the machine still to put the portafilter back inside the grouphead . this is simply due to the lightweight plastic casing . but i 'd rather hold the machine down than have to pay an extra $ 300 for something in stainless steel . all in all , the machine saves me about 3 bucks every time i use it . woohoo . - by zoe ros , not tim .
kitchen	amazing that in 2005 you can read review after review on amazon about the poor quality of almost every toaster offered . we hoped this one would be an exception . it was , but only in that it may be the poorest of them all . ours buzzed loudly whenever in use . never had a toaster buzz before . we toast bread at least twice a day , and the toasting performance of this unit is horrible . it has no bagel setting ( which toasts the cut side more than the crust side ) , so we ended up with one side burnt and the other barely starting to toast . what 's more , it toasts completely unevenly . one corner of toast will be blackened while the far corner will barely be tanned . and it 's really annoying when a 4-slice toaster does not allow you to operate the heating elements independently . as far as looks go , de'longhi did just as bad a job . the photos look cool , but the crumb tray this unit `` sits '' upon is actually wider than the unit itself , so there is a big uneven gap at the seam . it 's the lower line you see in the photos -- but they make it look real nice for that ! what you do n't see is the other side of the toaster where the bottom crumb tray will be sticking out several mm from the side of the toaster rather than being flush as shown . this makes it look broken , like two pieces of something that no longer fit together . if de'longhi had spent even a second thinking about this , they would have done the opposite : the bottom tray should be slightly smaller than the toasting unit , which would give the unit a seamless look rather than a busted look . ( we even went to a store [ yes , a real store ] to confirm that they are all like this , and they are . ) also , the bread warming rack is another poorly designed element . there are 4 tiny plastic feet inserted into the four metal posts of the rack so it does n't scratch the metal surface of the toaster . however , two of the feet had already fallen out during shipping , and though they slipped right back in , all four of the tiny feet can easily be removed or fall out ( only friction holds them in ) and you will loose them very quickly -- especially if you ever wash the rack . we 're happy to pay extra for a quality item -- even a toaster -- but we expect something in return besides utter dissapointment . final advice : stick to the $ 20 toasters with functions such as bagel , defrost , and dual controls . if it 's ugly , keep it under the sink and only take it out when you use it . this one looks broken , performs poorly , and costs a lot of money . if you do buy this model , maybe you 'll get ours ... we returned it
kitchen	i really like this bookcase . it is attractive , and easy to set up . simply fold the shelves into place . although it is easy to set up , it is pretty sturdy . there are spaces in the back that items could fall through , but there are wood slats to hold books in place . i also like the size of the bookcase : it is not too wide but holds a lot because it is tall , and the mission sides are nice
kitchen	at first i thought this was a great product . if you only make cheese fondue it is great . the pot is very easy to clean although it could be easier if it were dishwasher safe . the problem i 've had with mine is that it does n't get beyond about 320 degrees . the dial goes up to 400 but even after waiting for 30 minutes for it to heat up , it only got up to 323 degrees and would n't go any further . so if you want to use this for oil for a steak fondue it wo n't do the job well . i know these kinds of appliances have to have a short cord and also a break-away cord but this is ridiculous . touch the darn thing and the cord falls free . very frustrating if you have a lot of people trying to use it for fondue . people kept telling me that the cheese was getting `` hard '' because the cord had fallen off , again . next time i 'd get a pot that had a thermometer built in , do n't rely on the heat setting dial .
kitchen	ok , so i thought i was crazy , not being able to make a decent meal with my crockpot . people were making fun of me , `` how can you burn anything in a crockpot '' ? ? now , i look at the reviews on this thing and see that i am not alone . i always wondered why people liked food out of a crockpot ! now i know that they are not supposed to be like this ! ! ! do not ever buy this thing unless you like scorching burn gunk ! ! ! ! ! on the 10 hour setting it starts boiling within only a few hours ! ! ! ! i am trashing mine today ! !
kitchen	these bowls are so pretty , the colors are great . they are a lot heavier then i thought they would be also . i 'm so pleased with this purchase
kitchen	wow- this speaker is fantastic ! ! ! it took a little time to get it setup but once we figured it out , it worked like one of our top quality indoor speakers ! ! ! when i read the reviews i was hopeful but not sure . now we love it and would recommend it to anyone ! we can use it in the font yard , down by the swings and even in the basement ( which we did for our son 's pirate brithdday bash ) . please do n't pass this up ! if you are in the market for an outdoor speaker , this is great ! it may take a little time to set up but worth it . enjoy ! !
kitchen	although it does n't mention it , these hepa replacement filters also fit the hamilton beach air cleaner model 04150 . i had to email hamilton beach to find out , but they were very helpful and responded right away . when the filters arrived from amazon , i saw that on the box it says `` fits models 04160 , 04161 04150 . '' with our cat and houseful of antiques , we always seem to have dust bunnies floating around . i run this model in our office , under the table which holds the computer . since placing it there i have noticed the buildup of dust around the modem is almost entirely eliminated . i placed the larger model in our living room and it certainly is doing its job . the regular settings can be louder than expected , but i leave them on the `` whisper quiet '' setting when we 're in that room and i do n't even notice them being on . i would definitley recommend the hamilton beach air cleaners
kitchen	i was searching for a speaker system with docking capabilities for my ipod video and boy did i find a nice one ! with the arched back speaker portion of the stereo , it provides a surround-sound like atmosphere . also it has quite a loud capacity for volume . i mean if you wanted to , you could really get it crankin ' . anyway , it charges your ipod for you just like the computer and it will accomadate any style ipod . the sound clarity is very crisp and clear . the only , tiny flaw , i could find in this fine piece of audio was that in between songs , a soft , high-pitched whine is sometimes incurred . however , once the song begins to play , this whine disapears immediately . i would strongly suggest purchasing this item if you would like a quality speaker system for a reasonable price
kitchen	this bread slicer is quite good . it has a slicing guide and also a storage container part to it . it cleans easily and was cleverly designed to accomodate bread machine sized loaves . i have found though , that if i bake the largest size loaf , the loaf will be an inch or so to tall for it so after i slice a few slices i am able to put loaf on its side and then store it in the container .
kitchen	the frother works well as others have said . unfortunately , it broke very easily when i dropped it into the sink while cleaning . i 've only had it 3 or 4 months but did not save any warranty info . this device needs to be made stronger to withstand normal kitchen events
kitchen	i paid too much money for this tea kettle to drip from under the spout and spit water all over the stove before it even whistles . this is a disappointment ! save your money and search for a better kettle . this one is n't a good buy or a good produc
kitchen	i rate this negative five stars . i just purchased it , thinking , after reading all the reviews , that it was great . what a crock ! ! ! ! it 's absolutely worthless . it does not clean the water . it 's been plugged in for a whole day and the water is absolutely filthy . the water flows and the motor is running , the charcoal is in place but it does n't clean the water . i 'm better off with a bowl that i clean every day . this thing just swishes around dirty water . do n't waste your money
kitchen	i am looking for a new book light , and as a former owner of this light , i was suprised at the bad bulb stats . this bulb , like halogen bulbs , get very hot . it is imperative that you do not touch the bulb with your fingers when installing or adjusting it . the oil from your skin heats the bulb to a higher temp . and hastens failure . hope this help
kitchen	i have used a lightweight hoover for years and was very pleased with it . when i first received this new cleaner i was really excited with the power it had . the third time i used it the belt broke . with each use , my back would start hurting . the forward motion was very easy , but pulling it back was hard . i returned this product because i felt there was something wrong with it
kitchen	i own the graphite style of this set . i was originally very happy with the purchase - the set looked great , did n't chip easily , and was a great size . after a year of use i 've come up with a list of problems : the clear glazed surface on the plates and bowls can be scored by utensils which allows water/dirt to penetrate to the porous ceramic below leaving stains that can not be removed . the semi-matte finish acquires a `` powdery '' , almost bleached , look to it after many washings ( says dishwasher safe , guess that means the colors do n't wash away immediately ) my biggest complaint : we bought these because they were `` microwave safe '' . i do n't know what microwave safe means to most people , but it means to me that i could put a plate , bowl or cup in the microwave , heat up the contents , and then safely remove the object and use it . in the case of the set i purchased , it only seems to mean that the item placed in the microwave will not explode . unfortunately in the case of the sango graphite set , it means that the contents of the set are sheilded by the ( plate/bowl/cup ) and that the contents will emerge warm at best while you burn your hand attempting to extract the ( plate/bowl/cup ) that has soaked all of the energy up from the microwave . they get very hot ! ( cup of water heated for 2 mins results in water temperature of 120f while cup surface is 170f ! ) i 've only broken 2 items from the set , both times i dropped the items after getting them partly out of the microwave and realizing that my fingers were being burned ( first time i thought it was a fluke , second time i learned my lesson ) and dropped the item on the hard stove surface below the microwave . i emailed sango several times and received no response at all . while i liked the set a lot initially , i have been very disappointed over time with its quality . i will never purchase another from sango again
kitchen	i love these pieces . i plan on using them as decorative items when not being used to entertai
kitchen	i used an avocado smaller than the tool , so i had to uncomfortably squeeze the tool until it 'd fit . then it kind of smooshed my avocado into slices that were not attractive , while leaving a layer of unused avocado in the shell . it made me realize that it 's not *that* hard to slice an avocado with a paring knife ... oh well
kitchen	this is pretty in a rough casual sketched style . this will require ironing out of the dryer .
kitchen	too bad i did n't come here first , at epinions nobody had the reset problem but i sure did . it 's too bad too because this thing is a technological marval ... except it 's defective from the very start . my water is somewhere between hard and soft but more to the soft side . i read that using distilled or water with no mineral content will allow the boiler to boil less and therefore not trip the automatic shutoff . i now quote from the review of a sunbeam on this site : `` a vaporizer only works well if the mineral content in your water is `` ideal '' , so you may have to make simple adjustments if the water does n't boil ( add salt ) , or if it boils too rapidly ( add distilled water ) . this will prevent `` spurting '' , boiling over and overheated reservoirs . '' the problem is it is ridiculous to buy a water distiller for a unit that already has a good filter in it already ! the unit boils like the bejesus on low , putting it on high pushes it over the edge and it shuts off with the red blinking `` reset/refill '' light . i tried 4 times and even called tech support ( they were pretty clueless , are you listening bionaire ? ) . it 's really a pity too because the humidistat can be placed away from the unit and it wirelessly communicates to make sure the room is evenly humidified . i think the problem is that the water does not go high enough in the tray and you ca n't tilt it to fix the problem ( most warm mist are designed that way for some reason
kitchen	we bought this krups flf2-j4 with anticipation of and excelent machine for our needs . it is a nice looking unit light weight and fast at heating a full load of water . however , an odor is created in the unit and after two weeks of usage it still remains . it had n't diminished during that time . it smells like burnt plastic and it transfers that to the water for our tea or fresh ground coffee . not pleasant . we felt it just was n't safe . i 've repacked it and will return it if possible . krups know of this as they mentioned it in their manual .
kitchen	i often have to mix by hand , things always end up dry and grainy . might be partially my fault - maybe i should try adding the ingredients as it 's mixing . it makes a really huge mess . my mother and i both bought one , but i told her to return hers , it was n't worth it
kitchen	i ordered this pan even though i had never heard about this brand before.but the picture on the site and the product review looked good.when i recieved this item the lid that was promised was not shipped.the pan looked worn out and it looked factory refurbished.i returned the pan today and i promised myself that this is the last time i order brands that i have never heard about through the internet.its better to stick to brands like faberware and calphalon which have not caused me any problems earlier and have lasted for such a long time
kitchen	i purchased this toaster oven because i loved its exterior design and thought it would look great in my kitchen . it did ... until the middle knob came off after less than 6 months of use . i 've been using a pair of pliers to turn it on for the last 5 months while i await my replacement part . i have followed-up on my request with delonghi customer service on a number of occassions and they offer no solution other than to continue to wait . i even left a message with a supervisor and received no response whatsoever . i vow to never buy a delonghi product again . still waiting for that knob..
kitchen	i like this grater . it 's easy to use and clean . and , nothing is better on salad than freshly grated cheese
kitchen	unless you are cleaning the fishbowl , this thing is useless
kitchen	ok let me start by saying i am not a coffee snob , i am more of a coffee nut , i very much prefer a cup of my nice dark italian roast but if the neighbor offers me a cup of his foldgers i wont turn up my nose . and for a guy like me this machine is perfect ! ! i looked at the 500 dollar machines but just couldnt see spending that for something i see myself using 4-5 days out of the week so i setteled on this machine and i have not one regret . i have had the machine about 3 weeks now , i admit i dont use it every day as i have thoses mornings where i am just running late and dont have time , but in that three weeks i have used it at least 5 days out of every week and it has been great . this thing is so easy to use right out of the box with the pods i was just amased , my old machine went down quite a while ago so i havent pulled a shot in a very long time and with this machine i was sipping a great one in minutes ! the one thing that did dissapoint me is the pods , i bought the machine thinking i would use them as they seemed so convient ... and dont get me wrong , the illy dark roast pods make one of the best shots of espresso i have ever had , very quickly , but keep in mind they only make one shot at a time so for me who usually likes 3 or 4 shots in a cappucino they are a bit time consuming and i have found it better to just pack my own double shots . but besides that little thing this machine is perfect for a coffee nut like me , it does a great job no matter what im in the mood for , be it a straight shot , a cappucino , or the nice mocha latte every now and then this is a great machine for you , may not be good enough for a coffee snob ... but just right for a coffee nut ! oh and one hint i found very helpfull ... turn the machine on 5 or 10 minutes before you are going to use it ( the longer the better ) with your cups up on the warmer . i saw some people complaining that the espresso was only luke warm when it came out , i exprenced the same problem when i dont let it warm up and brew into a cold cup , but if you do let it warm up it will make you a nice piping hot espresso !
kitchen	i guess misters are hard to make because most of the ones i have bought in my life do n't work out of the box or die shortly after . this one did n't even work out of the box . there was no mist , just air . oh well , i figured i was taking my chances anyway . if you buy this , hopefully you have better luck . update : nowadays , most grocery stores sell pre-packaged , pressurized spray canisters of olive or canola oil . it 's like a can of raid except it sprays oil . i have found that these work perfectly and last a long time
kitchen	we waited too long to try this out after it came . we would return it if it was n't so late . it takes forever to warm up and forever to cook ! then the waffle is not hot ! not happy at all with it
kitchen	this krups toaster is the best i have ever used ! perfect toast every time . the wide slots center bagels properly and you have the option to toast the cut side only or both sides . the lift function eliminates trying to fish out small pieces with a fork or knife . the defrost function works great . if large bread slices dont fit properly horizontally , they will fit vertically as the toaster is deep enough to handle these large slices . the crumb tray slides out easily , eliminating the usual mess in cleaning out a toaster . all in all , the best toaster i have ever owned
kitchen	i bought this to cover the disintegrating cover currently on my futon . it 's a beautiful print , and a good color that matches my drapes , but what i did n't quite understand at the time i bought it was that it 's also just one big piece of fabric . no fitted edges , or elastic to hold it in place - kind of disappointing . but since i was covering a futon , i was able to tuck it around the mattress where it folds , shove a wooden dowel into the crease , and voila ! a great looking couch appeared . so , all things considered , a pretty good buy for the money
kitchen	after much research and consideration i decided to buy this product as a christmas gift for my husband . i am not the type of person to research products before i buy them , but taking into consideration how picky my husband is about his espresso ( and being cuban and drinking cuban coffee since birth -- makes you critical and suspicious about the quality of the coffee made by these new espresso machines ) , i did not want to buy something that was not going to meet our expectations . i have to say this product has surpassed my expectations and my husband is very pleased with it . my main concern was how hot the coffee would be , and this product makes the coffee with the right temperature and richness that we have come to expect from the corner cafeteria coffee . i 've read reviews about the noise it makes , and after having the deloghi product , the noise this machine makes when warming up is not that loud at all . we are very happy with it . buy it , you 'll be happy too
kitchen	it works well , and it 's good for the price . not too stable and sturdy , but it gets the job done just fine
kitchen	nice little toaster with good price . just be careful it can get really hot when toasting .
kitchen	i received the shams , and was suprised with the colour . these are almost a mustard yellow , not what i would call sunlight . the picture shown reflects a lot of light , thus looking paler . the quality looks to be good , and i did wash and iron them . they do look good with my bedspread ( a blue laura ashley floral ) and pick up the yellow in it . for the price , i think they are a good buy . it 's nice to have a change now and again ...
kitchen	* purchased at petsmart * seems to work well * very quiet when operating properly * took our cats a little over a week to get used to it * the flow is n't very good when the setting is low . we keep it at medium . * i clean it out about once a week . cat hair from our medium-haired cat builds up and can clog the motor and scum forms on the sides of the drinking well
kitchen	very thin and unsteady . could n't open it without having to hold the back of it . it wobbled side to side as i was forcing it to open . i sent it back as soon as i got it
kitchen	i purchased this fan for my teenage son who like the drone of a fan to sleep . i have since purchased another one to put at the top of my stairs to help circulate the air from the downstairs since we have no ceiling fans . my son loves how much air this baby pumps out and the steady hum has been a wonderful plus , saying he has n't slept this good in a long time . the 2nd fan has done wonders for the house circulation and i too have come to enjoy sleeping with it on in my bedroom . very sturdy steel construction , easy assembly of the legs . 3 speeds . top speed is out of this world . almost like a wind storm . me and my boys actually ripped up tissue paper and had a ball putting it in front of the fan and watching them swirl all over the house . what a riot ! i highly recommend this fan for excellent air circulation , sleep aid and some silly fun
kitchen	this did n't do as well as an old microwve poper i 've used for yers . it did n't showa great increase in kernals popped , and they were not as light and crispy . it is absolutely necessary to use the 'power packs ' , which i could n't find in local stores . since i gave several of the poppers as gifts i shopped on line for replacement 'power packs ' for all and found the postage/handling fee for 10 packages was ten times what it cost for one ( incredibly light ) pack .
kitchen	worked just fine for over a year , then started behaving very oddly . among the various problems this tob-30bc unit exhibited , the most dangerous was switching itself on even when the main control was set to off , not switching itself off at the end of a toasting cycle , sending alarms when switched off , not being able to switch the unit off ! this unit neds to be unplugged from the outlet and i consider it to be a fire hazard . repeated communications to cuisinart remain unanswered .
kitchen	this is a great heater . it warms up the room very quickly , it has a nice feature of oscillating , it also works as a fan ; the thermometer is good
kitchen	extremely delighted with this product . not only does it perform flawlessly , it 's beautiful to look at . combine that with the best price anywhere , thanks to amazon and target , and you have perfection ! thanks .
kitchen	i paid what i would call a fairly high price for a blanket i could have gotten from a discount club for half the price . the photo is very misleading in that only the top and bottom edges are hemmed , the left/right sides are simply cut . i expect this to disolve within 4 washes . will not buy from this manufacturer again
kitchen	this set is so versatile . i bought these because i own the red le creuset cookware and they matched them . i thought that i would never use them and they would collect dust in the cupboard , but the longer i own them the more uses i find for them ! great for appetizer containers , for making mini casseroles ( or quiches ) , creme brulee , serving soup , i 've even baked mini bread loaves in them ! the only recommendation i have is to buy two sets -- i usually end up using four at a time instead of two .
kitchen	this whale is so much fun i got it for when my sisters kids came down . they had a hard time staying on it though but it was fun for me . it was such a hit i have two now they got one for me before they left saying now you gots two so next time we come you can ride too . overall great , strong , and fun :
kitchen	this delonghi bar32 espresso maker is the only budget priced espresso maker that i can find that does not have aluminum its water/coffee path . the boiler , porta-filter baskets , brew group , and steam wand are all stainless steel ( albeit the wand has a plastic tip ) . i thought the capressopro with a slightly larger stainless boiler might qualify as aluminum free and provide good competition but the porta-filter itself is made of aluminum ( although it does have stainless basket inserts ) and is twice the price than the delonghi bar32 . it is questionable that the acidic coffee might poor over onto the aluminum porta filter and leach aluminum at the bottom of the porta-filter after exiting the stainless baskets - although capresso implies no in their ads .
kitchen	i was very , very disappointed with the performance of the tribest blender . i bought it to blend breakfast smoothies ... .nothing fancy ... .just some protein powder and soy milk . i even bought the larger cup . the unit is very , very under powered . did not mix the ingredients . had to transfer everything to my larger , more `` industrial '' blender . would not recommend this unit for any serious blending . save your money or put it towards a better unit . this product is a rip off . does not even do the most basic blending of a liquid and a powder
kitchen	it stopped working 6 months after the warranty ran out . according to sanyo will cost more to fix than i paid . while it lasted it worked fine .
kitchen	i read the two other bad reviews here and just bought 9 of these anyway . i was stupid . i had bought one in the past and have had it for a few months . that one is great and has held up after multiple washings . it is still so soft . so i just did n't belive the two bad reviews . i was wrong . the bad reviews are correct . i took these new 9 out of the box yesterday . they are not of the same quality of the one i already have . they are packed at least 3 different ways . i think maybe some of them are someone else 's defective returns . i do n't think these are first quality . there are many snags . there is at least one blue stain . one looks like it was defective and then repaired sloppily . the quality of the construction is not good . some are soft , some are rough . i returned all 9 . do not buy
kitchen	this soap dish is beautiful , practical and sturdy . best of all , it will retain all water and liquid soap leftovers in its tray , leaving your bathroom clean and dry . recommended .
kitchen	i bought this oven recently . it is cheaply made but most of the functions do a fair job . all except the rotisserie ; when used , grease runs from the unit onto the countertop even though the unit is level and the drip tray is not full . i was very dissapointed . i contacted them via email today , they say they will get with me in 24 hrs . we 'll see
kitchen	normally things i purchase , have no problem . this item is now being used to heat water when company comes over for tea . has to be the worse item to make coffee yet . always purchase the whole beans and grind the coffee myself , this item just never got the coffee 's true wonderful flavor . perhaps because it was a refurbished item , but i just think hamilton beach needs to improve this item big time
kitchen	we had a heated pad for years that finally played out . it was wonderful . wanting to spend less this time than i did for the first one , i bought this item . i wish i had never put it on the bed so i could have returned it . i was suspect when i opened it . poor quality material . poor bed fit . very very warm on the lowest setting . after 3 sleepless nights of feeling the wires , which are quite large , in my ribs -- it had to come off . i had rather be cold and i hate being cold
kitchen	i ordered this china specifically to use during the holidays . it arrived in perfect condition with all pieces accounted for , and is absolutely lovely . the red and gold combination can be used year-round , and it is dishwasher safe ! i like it so much i intend to order another service for 8 . excellent value
kitchen	for quite a while i had been looking for a certain type of dvd rack/tower ... then one day in target i was looking at the mission collection and saw the box ( no display ) . it is exactly what i had been looking for . slapped on the two foot ends and done ! perfect fit for dvds , 20 fit across and if you have a lot of the cheapy dvd cases , like the ones new line cinema puts out , you can fit more . i do n't have the hassle like some wire racks where you can only fit one dvd per slot . i have many oversized ones . the hardwood is great too , just a few felt pads on the backs to not scratch the wall . if you can wait for them to go on sale every now and then ... it is worth it . i am almost ready to buy a third one soon
kitchen	soft , comfortable , perfect . i came back to buy more . i want to throw the rest of my sheets away . i was reluctant to buy sheets without being able to touch them first , but am so glad i took the chance
kitchen	i bought this for my 2 dogs it works great cleans up easily ! the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of five is because of it 's large size it makes it really hard to fill it up inside your home . it does n't fit under my kitchen sink faucet . i do n't have one of those tall neck faucets or a sprayer ( wish i did ) ) otherwise it would be a snap to fill . i have to use my bathtub to fill it up and my bathtub is upstairs . the container is really heavy once it 's full . my only suggestion would be to purchase a smaller one ( 2 gallon or 1 gallon ) , waterer . it would be easier to handle . i also bought the 5 gallon feeder i love it ! it holds a whole 5lb . bag of food which is great ! so get the larger feeder the smaller waterer . oh and my dogs love the gurgling sound the water makes after they drink out of it ! :
kitchen	if you 're of italian heritage and you grate a lot of cheese , do n't waste your time with this one . when the quantity of cheese in the grater gets low , it tends to be very difficult to turn . it also did n't last as long as i expected . try a different one instead
kitchen	if you 're looking for a car harness that will keep your dog safe in an accident , keep looking ... this harness might work to prevent your dog from bouncing around the car and possibly distracting the driver ( although i 'm not even confident it would hold up for that use with a big , strong dog ) but i seriously doubt it would hold up even in a mild collision . the dog is held in place using a few plastic buckles/snaps which are not even very strong-looking -- i have seen stronger snaps on regular dog collars . plastic snaps like these would not hold up to the forces created in a collision . if you want a safety harness that will protect your dog in an accident , look for one that has actually been tested/rated similar to human car safety devices
kitchen	this swissmar fondue set is excellent . i love how stylish it is . i looked on amazon and other sites looking for a flexible fondue set that could do : - cheeses - broths for meat - chocolate flexibility is what i was looking for . the 3 in 1 is perfect for doing cheese to start with , when done with that course , remove the ceramic bowl , pour the water out of the copper pot , and put in your broth . although i have n't used it for chocolate yet , i 'm sure it will work well for that . using this setup for cheese is better than ones that have the burner directly heating the bottom of the bowl instead of water between the pot and bowl which more evenly distributes the heat . others tend to burn on the bottom unless you constantly stir . of course if you 're into the tradition of swiss fondue cooking , the `` thick '' part in the bottom is the tasty part for your special guest ! the burner is hot enough to keep your broth simmering unlike another i have used . also it holds enough fuel to keep things going throughout that course . you will need to refill it between cheese and broth - of course make sure it 's extinguished and cool before doing so . i used bottled gel purchased from a local cooking store . an excellent purchase - i am very happy with it .
kitchen	when i was looking to purchase a new machine , i only was looking for a bunn . bunn makes the best coffee machines , none can compare . every diner , coffee house , and dunkin ' donuts only use bunn machines . the a10 is one great machine ! brews perfect cups of coffee hot and quickly . everyone in my office is very happy with the unit . if you 're a serious coffee drinker , please do n't cheap out on a mr.coffee , braun or krupps -- frankly they can not brew coffee at the speed , temperature , or taste of a bunn unit . i bought the a10 to replace a bunn unit that i used for 10 years without a glitch
kitchen	it is best to invest a few more dollars and purchase a better item light and not providing the warmth expected from this price level . feels incomplet
kitchen	some how my previous review text got a little glitched up . but suffice it to say the only thing going for these knives is that the probably cut . the manufacture of these knives is well below the quality i expected ... . it 's the first time i ; ve been totally disappointed ... . we 're returning the knives because they are not worth the money . really , they look great in the picutre , but they are very poor quality . why else would a four hundred dollar set be selling for twentysix dollars
kitchen	okay - there 's something wrong with brita filters . they do n't always fit into the pitchers - when i tilt the pitcher i can hear the filter shifting inside - and yes , i am aligning it properly . it may filter out impurities contained in the tap water , but only to replace them with thick black carbon particles . i 've followed all the instructions and replace the filters every second month , but darned if there is n't a problem with every single one ! do n't buy this - look for another alternative
kitchen	i dont recoment you to buy this product . i dont under stand why they made i
kitchen	my husband goes to bed much later than i do . until i got this gadget , i had to go to sleep with a bedroom light on , and he would leave a low light on in the living room in order to see his way to the bedroom . i have installed 3 of these units , one in the living room , one in the hall , and one in the bedroom . they light up sequentially as he comes to be
kitchen	beware ! on off switch broke machine would not cut off unless unplugged . the place they recommended based on my zip code still has my vacuum and it 's been about 2 weeks . : -
kitchen	so , this clock woke me up alright ! the snooze did n't work , and then i could n't turn it off ! i had to rip the batteries out of it to get it to stop ... it is very cheaply made ( explains the price i guess ) , but yeah it works just fine as long as you do n't need to use the snooze ever
kitchen	we recently purchased this kit to install on the top and bottom stairs with a kidco gate . it was very easy to install , its very sturdy and we did not have to drill any holes into our banister . we would definately recommend it to everyone
kitchen	i loved this when we first got it home . i 'm handicapped and ca n't push a big vacuum . so , this was just right to pick up the `` top showing '' dirt until the housekeeper could get here once a week . but after two months the ac adapter cord just snapped in half . it was oddly brittle from the very beginning . i contacted euro pro who would not replace it under warranty . so , i ordered a new adapter from them ( which came to approx . $ 15 ) with shipping . now six weeks later , they sent me a card saying `` due to overwhelming demand ... .. '' the adapter is on back order . i wonder why they have such a large demand ? funnily enough , the cleaner has still been working for the whole six weeks on it 's last charge . but , no more . i think it 's time to bury it and move onto an old fashioned ( no power ) push sweeper
kitchen	the heater that i received was defective . i down loaded a return label from amazon.com and returned the heater . i received my refund very quickly . i have two other delonghi heaters of a different model that i am very happy with but are no longer manufactured . this was my first experiance with this particular model
kitchen	the legs were a bit tricky to put down , and when i did , i busted the mounts . never even used this thing threw it away . coleman makes one that i bought that 's better built , and excalibur electronics has one available as well that i also bought - i like excalibur 's better , but both are better than this piece of junk . all 3 brands are in the same price range . interestingly , there are n't a lot of portable ac/dc fan options out there ... i bought these for camping in florida
kitchen	the bissell flip-it saves me a lot of time cleaning floors and does a more thorough job than a mop
kitchen	this is the most loathesome appliance i have ever owned . i hate everything about it . some genius put the power cord at the bottom of the unit , so you have to hold the cord up all the time to keep from backing over it . this may not be such a problem if the stupid `` self propelled '' function were n't constantly trying to shoot backward , meaning i need both hands just to push the unit forward . it 's like i 'm dancing with my vacuum and we 're fighting for the lead . ridiculous . i have almost 2000 sf of carpet in my house , and i wake up sore the next day after a round with this monster . oh -- it also came with a free little red dd sweeper -- the handle of which broke the first time i tried to use it . i do n't know if dd came under new management or what , but i will never buy one of their products again
kitchen	this fan is an excellent value for its price . it gives 3 options for style of air flow nd 3 speeds . additionally , it is easy to move the head up and down so that you can either just circulate the air or actually have the air blow at body level . i bought this fan because my old one had `` died '' in the middle of a hot summer . this one filled the bill and is effective in a small to medium sized room . the only reason that i did not give this fan a rating of 5 is because it has begun to hesitate when it swings to the right . this has happened to other similar fans i have had , but not so soon after purchase . if you 're mechanical , you can probably correct the problem by yourself . i do recommend this fan for anyone and any place . oh , did i say the remote is perfect ? ? ? because i am handicapped , it saves me from getting up and down too often
kitchen	this whisk is excellent ; it is well made and easy to clean . i use mine all the time to beat eggs for making omelets etc . it is excellent quality that will last a lifetime . highly recommended ! a+
kitchen	this was very easy to put together and it holds a lot of coats . great product at a great price
apparel	the only thing better than these sunglasses is the customer service i got , after i dropped and broke the lenses on these i called 80 's purple and they actually sent me out a replacement free of charge . i was blown away
apparel	this light worked for one day . i should have known better because in the past , i bought a tap light , and it worked for only a few days , too . do n't waste your money
apparel	i 've tried 6 different nursing bras . this one , with the center snap closure , is the easiest to use . it is also the lightest and most comfortable , while providing good support . my only complaint is that after about 50 washes the underwire begins to poke free from the fabric . even when i try to sew it back into place , it breaks loose after a few washes . perhaps if i handwashed the bra instead of using a machine , it would last longer . this bra is less durabe than my other nursing bras ( particularly the leading lady bra , which seems to be indestructible ) , but it is well worth the sacrifice for comfort , lightness , and ease of use . it is by far my favorite
apparel	i have had my bag for a couple of months . the liner on the inside has already ripped
apparel	the photo is quite deceiving . this suit is made out of cheap polyester fabric that looks cheap , shiny , and is horrible to the touch . my three year olds hate the uncomfortable stiffness . spend the extra money for a decent fabric that is actually practical for a toddler if they really need a suit
apparel	i had bought a bra of this model at a discount store , just got lucky . it quickly became my favorite , and i was glad to find it at amazon .
apparel	lookslike it would be a nice product , but it 's only for very small babies up to 12 pounds and 23 inches . my baby is very long and just does n't fit - wish target/amazon would have been more upfront with the sizing
apparel	i purchased the non-premium kit ( $ 9.99 ) with a silicone skin case cover and 2 screen protectors ( one for each screen ) , but it is the same case . the problem is that the silicone skin cover is slippery , twice as slippery as the nintendo lite without the cover . we thought that washing them in dove dish soap would wash away the slipperyness , but that did n't work . after handling the cover , your hands have a slippery residue on them . the other issue is that the cover is so thin that it is little more than scratch protection , not impact protection . the screen covers that come with the non-premium kit are ok , i guess , but one of them had 2 defect particles that were raised ( trust me , the screen was clean ) . i purchased 2 kits , and i had one screen protector defect and my wife accidentally broke one of the silicone covers hinge straps with little effort . i do not recommend this product at all
apparel	good quality jeans at an affordable price . size is just right , quite comfortable
apparel	not the best fabric , scratchy and see thru . you get what you pay for on these
apparel	i love these shoes and they are so cute and comfortable . the heel is not so tall that you feel like you ca n't walk . customer service and shipping was excellent . best price i could find . do n't hesitate on this purchase . you 'll love them
apparel	this is a piece of garbage . it 's cute-looking , and *just barely* will fit *just* your ds and maybe a few games and the cleaning cloth , but as far as any kind of long-term travel functionality , look elsewhere . the charger does n't fit in there very well , which i do n't think is an unreasonable demand for a handheld device carrying case . i was able to squeeze both my ds lite and the charger in there for awhile , but recently the zipper broke , and i had to split it apart to get to my stuff , and now it 's useless . if all you want is something to carry just the ds in , this is a decent option . otherwise , forget it
apparel	it 's really hard to buy scrub pants on-line because everyone is different . cherokee always fits perfectly and good quality . i think they should consider a wider array of sizes in petite . by the time i finished hemming them , i did n't have that cute slit at the bottoms . they wash well and wear well
apparel	i initially bought these shoes for my mom for a christmas gift , but she said they were too high for her . well i fixed that , i kept them for myself . : ) i love them and they are really hot ! thnx ja
apparel	i have a 33-34 waste . i bought the medium size because it is advertised to be fit for 32-34 waste . the thing is too tight ! it almost blocks circulation to my legs . plus , the fabric is not entirely pleasant to the touch . i was mostly disappointed with this product . you can find a much better value at this price
apparel	the product was received on 6/18 . when i tried it on i found it to be too large , utilizing the return form included with the order i completed it and returned the item via ups on 6/20 . i 'm still not sure about the return policy ! when i had n't heard from the uniform company after about 2 weeks i called them . i was informed that they did in fact receive my return but the size that i needed , large , was not in stock and it would be 4 to 5 days before it could be shipped . i 'm still waiting ! when i get the product i can properly review it
apparel	i missed my late 80s over the knee suede boots , which is why i got these . they are great ! the only thing that could be much improved are the soles and heel . they are very thing . i 'd wear them out in a day . i had to have them resoled . but the ammazon price was so good it was still a steal .
apparel	i ordered this item and a pair of mocha nubuck as well . i 've been wearing birks and various varieties of them for years . i 'm always very satisfied with the fit , delivery time , and the customer service that i receive from midwest sports . i wear my clogs in all sorts of weather except when there is fresh snow , but as soon the walkways and streets are clear , i 'm back in them with thicker socks of course . they can be a little stiff at times , but once you break them in after a couple weeks of constant wearing , you will love them like no other
apparel	the shoes are better then expected.. everyone comments on how nice they are and where did you get them.. i will let anyone know to buy the
apparel	this is a nice shirt , not as warm as we had hoped though . the lining is quite thin . it washes fairly well , loses a bit of its shape but not a lot . a great shirt for the fall . its roomy comfortable
apparel	i received the earmuffs i ordered 3 days after i placed the order
apparel	it 's only been the last 7 years or so that i 've enjoyed wearing a robe around the house , i admit i used to be walking around in my underwear when i woke up in the morning ! all of my previous robes were typically off the clearance racks , and mostly some kind of inexpensive terrycloth . i bought this becuase my last robe is falling apart . i have to say that although i hesitated to spend 100 bucks on a robe , when it got here and i wore it for a couple days , i really like it . i bought the large black robe ; i 'm 6ft , about 200lbs , a little heavy around the middle , and the robe fits pretty well . the arms are baggy and the sleeves are long enough to touch the back of my hand just after the wrist . the length extends to just about the bottom of my calf muscle in my legs . it `` flows '' nice too , when i walk , not like the heavier terrycloth robe . and the silk lining makes me feel `` rich '' ! overall , i like it
apparel	i ordered the black one . according to the photo provided , it was supposed to be black with white seams , but when i received it , it was all black . once i put it on it fitted perfectly . but it is simply too difficult to put on even though it is the right size .
apparel	i totally did n't have a problem with the seller or anything , great shipping ! um , but , the book kinda rots . if you know how to tie a tie already , then it might be fine , but i do n't . the pictures did n't really help , and the wording was n't concise . one sentence could be interpreted like nine ways ! ! i practically destroyed one tie , definitely practice with a tie you do n't care about or one that doesnt need to be dry-cleaned , cuz they get pretty rumpled .
apparel	unfortunately , the pockets are small , the fabric is poor quality , the seams already have started to split after wearing it twice . overall poor quality . i would not recommend these scrubs . i personally will never buy from this company again . on a more positive note , they did get the right size and shipped promptly
apparel	this hoodie is very poorly made . i bought a blue version and i had to return it after washing it in cold water on gentle . it faded substantially , changed shape , and the threading came loose . not recommended ! !
apparel	this is a top quality item . i is an 80 % /20 % cotton/poly mix-double stitched seams ... very well made . i bought a 2x for my son who ususally wears a 3x , and after putting it through the washer and dryer twice , it 's just as perfect as the day it was delivered .
apparel	for the money i spent on this bra it should be a better bra all around . it gives a classic `` torpedo '' shape to the breasts , does not offer any lift , and is pretty much unwearable .
apparel	i have ordered this tux for my 18 months old son for my sister 's wedding . it looked amazing ! ! ! the suit arrived timely and i could n't believe how perfect they have prepared the whole package . all the details were well thought and the tux looked perfect with satin buttons , matching waist band and stripes on the side of the pants . even the shirt is so well tailored . my son was very comfortable in the suit during the whole night and accepted more applouds than the groom ! i sincerely recommend this product
apparel	these are the best slippers i have ever owned ! ! ! they cradle your feet in super soft memory foam . when i get home from work everyday , i slide my feet into them and am instantly relaxed . i love these slippers ! ! ! the best ever ... after much wear , i will buy another pair !
apparel	i had been on the look out for a mary jane pump that i could wear to work with pants and skirts . i finally found this shoe online and decided to give it a try . usually steve madden 's run big on me , so i got a size smaller , and surprisingly , it was actually too small . a half size up did the trick , however . i love that it comes in patent leather because it really adds a kick to your feet . they 're also very comfortable for a high-heeled shoe . my only complaint is that the show is actually very deep on the top , and there 's quite a bit of toe cleavage . i guess this is n't necessarily a bad thing , it just did n't look like that at all in the picture . also , the strap that goes across the top of the foot is very low , and if you have wide feet , it could make your feet look even wider ( or fatter ) . despite those two small flaws , i really like this shoe and find that i can wear it with almost anything ( they look especially cute with skirts )
apparel	i was unable to return the item because of restrictions imposed by their return policy i made a mistake by buying i
apparel	i got these socks as a gift at my baby shower . i 've looked everywhere trying to find them so i could buy more . these socks stay on my little boy 's feet and are made very well
apparel	must have shoe for bunion and hammertoe sufferers . i also have very hot sweaty feet and these are an excellent choice if you share these problems . very large toe box and excellent webbing for ventilation . very good looking comfortable shoes . only qualification is that if you stand on your feet all day or do a lot of walking you may want to pick a shoe with more support -- these are very lightweight shoes but lack the support a heavier athletic shoe would offer -- but those type of shoes are usually harder on bunions and my feet get extremely hot in them
apparel	i bought this for my boyfriend . it is soft and comfy . it is definitely comfy for me to snuggle with . and as a bonus he likes it too . my only complaint is that the sleeves are little too long . but overall we are very happy with the purchase
apparel	incredible boot ! comfort , style and warmth have proved their way with this boot . i get positive comments each time i wear them ! the tread is perfect for walking in snow pack too . you do n't slide a bit . i 'll enjoy these for years
apparel	i love the color and the flexibility of the material . it does n't slip out of your hand and the cover gives full protection
apparel	maybe , just maybe , someone will buy one of these stick up bulbs and maybe , just maybe , the bulb will last more than about 10 minutes of total use before it burns out . i thought to myself `` buy another one because maybe this one was defective . '' i bought three more ... ..every time the tiny bulb burned out in minutes of use . it 's a great idea ... .but a worthless piece of junk . the spare bulb ? useless as well . do n't waste a dollar on this junk . if i could have found the receipts i would have gotten my money back .
apparel	i love this bra ! it is very comfortable and like the other reviewer said , adds a whole cup size ! cheaper than victoria 's secret and well made
apparel	we just had our son in january and we could n't resist these cute little shoes . even though he 's only 3 months old we ca n't wait to see our little guy in them . what a well made product !
apparel	i was disapointed with this jacket . it was advertized as cashmere . when i received it the label stated it was recycle cashmere and it did not look or feel like cashmere . i was very disappointed and i returned the item
apparel	the slipper seems to have some craftmenship . in my case they seem to run about a half size small . who wants to wait for a pair of slippers to stretch ? i wish i had known this in advance ... they look good in my closet though
apparel	material extremely thin and almost transparent when it is held up to light . it 's very dissappointing for an izod product . i would have returned it had i not bought it for my 82 year old father whom discarded the packaging
apparel	i had to return it immediately when i opened the box . on the picture it looks more blue than purple
apparel	i love these jeans -- i have 3 pair and they are the only jeans i wear . just enough stretch to be comfy but not too tight . i wear a size 14 and these jeans fit me great .
apparel	this is great . i measured before i put it on after . i lost over 2 inches . i highly recommend this
apparel	i had got these for my husband for christmas . nice material , however they were too tapered at the ankle and also short for him and he is average height , so we had to return it
apparel	this is ideal for wearing layers of clothing or if you 're dressed in a short sleeve over this one . however , i personally prefer the long sleeved version by the same company .
apparel	paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon/this store - never again !
apparel	my 6-yr. old is football nuts right now and he loves his jerseys ! great product and very well made . can also be very versatile worn by itself in the summer and with a shirt underneath in the winter
apparel	i use these socks for running and they are very well cushioned and comfortable . they also withstand frequent laundry without loosing quality .
apparel	this bra is one of the most uncomfortable bra 's i 've tried . it 's seems to be made cheaply and digs into my skin . i would not recommend it
apparel	not best for running but look very cool . comfortable enough to wear for styl
apparel	i bought this dress in black . good news -- - it does flatter your postpartum shape . bad news -- - the pockets for the nursing pads do n't go where they should , causing leakage . worse , the color black showed milk stains after i leaked . definitely not worth the price . how important is your figure when you 're sleeping anyway
apparel	this belt is seriously great . i ordered it and it arrived 3 days later , exactly as the seller described . i 'm not sure what the previous review was all about , but my belt is great . i love how i can use interchangeable buckles with it
apparel	the scarf arrived with several holes in it . my daughter was very dissappointed , crying and wondering why santa sent this to her . we ordered well in advance before christmas but the set arrived too late . we were never notified that there would be a delay in shipping . a few days before christmas it arrived ! it was too late to do anything . amazon should improve the quality control of vendors before it allows them to list on their site .
apparel	this brown leather wallet does not have a highly glossy finish as shown in the image ; leather is well-stitched but thin . old-fashioned style with no credit card slots . snaps and zipper handle add bulk to profile ; not a front pocket wallet for sure . purchased two as gifts for nephews , will probably get one for myself .
apparel	so far i have been very satisfied with this bag . for the price i really ca n't complain . it has enough different sections , places for pens , a divider , pouches in front and other nice touches that makes it a pleasure to use . i 'm curious about the durability ; how the leather will hold up and if the zippers will last . i use it to hold 2 1 '' notebooks , a textbook , a portfolio , a book , a calculator and my pda . this is about maximum capacity . i should note that the notebooks and portfolio just do fit inside the sections . the handle ontop is cozy , the over the shoulder strap should be wider . overall , i am happy with the purchase , and hope that it lasts
apparel	i gave these slippers to my mother for christmas and they do not hold up well . the first pair came apart in the wash and the second pair has n't been washed yet , but they 're already coming apart also . not a good buy .
apparel	i just received two of these bra-less nursing nightgowns ( sm ) , a robe ( sm/m ) , and the two piece tank pj set ( sm ) . i 'm almost nine months pregnant and have gained 50ish pounds and despite the other review about not fitting during pregnancy , it ( and the other items ) fits and stretches well while holding its shape . i will wear this now and indefinitely after the baby comes : it 's apparent that it will fit me well after baby too . the quality of the fabric is substantial enough to hold large ( and engorging ) breasts without the need for a bra . it is strong but breathable , and not flimsy so it slightly smoothes out quirks of the pregnant body . the length is a little longer than most - it slightly covers my knees - which is what i wanted so slit is nice to have for normal strides walking , easing out of bed , hiking up to use the washroom , etc . without tearing the seams . as the description and the other review indicates , the cups can slide down for pumping or nursing . i 'm very happy with the colors , design , and construction of all items . due to the volume of my order ( directly from the [ ... ] site , i received a high quality free minky dot chenille blanket that came rolled and ribboned in a nice tulle bag . i would definitely get this for other expectant or new moms
apparel	the pj bottoms were soft and of good quality material . however , i ordered the extra large , and they were very small for that size . it seemed as though the xl was more a med/large . i would also think that `` lounge pants '' or `` pj bottoms '' would be a bit bigger as you would n't want these types of pants too tight . they were a gift , so i just hope they do n't shrink after washing !
apparel	looks nothing like the image shown . 3 inches shy of even hitting the knee , let alone over it ( and she is n't tall 5'5 '' ) . keep looking ... .
apparel	i thought this product was going to be easier but i have found it really dosent work the tape dosent like to stick to your skin and i think the sizes are off i wear a 38c and so i got it its like whereing a b cup not a c well i hope this info helps people sher
apparel	it 's a little on the thin side for snowy or freezing weather , but great in keeping the chill off when you 're out and about , or at the game . the blue is actually more of a royal blue than navy blue , but the lettering is well stitched and is the same quality used on mlb baseball caps ( also has the mlb logo on back ) . it folds up easily and can be tucked into a jacket pocket with room to spare . the price is great and makes a great gift
apparel	i bought two of these , hoping to use them as sashes in a bridal event , and quickly returned them . since it took over two weeks for delivery , i am uncertain as to the efficiency of the return/refund . the sashes are not the quality that i thought was represented by the term `` charmeuse '' , and are thin and gauzy . they came in a large padded envelope with a total wt of under 4oz , much of that must have been the packaging . a quick refund will restore some trust in this vendor and the transaction
apparel	i am vey unhappy with the sales professional in nautica outlet stores . i had a very bad experience at nautica store outlet stores . the customer service representatives are very rude and unprofessional . they basically said they do n't really care if they lose one customer , other customers will still buy . ( if that is the case , why are prices slashed by 50 % ... it is because people do not want to pay the full price ... ) i do not think i will ever buy from nautica . a few uncaring sales represtatives give a very bad name to the whole company
apparel	they looks nice , and fit really well , however , not so soft like some other clarks/indigo .
apparel	while i was a little wary of ordering a jacket for $ 20 online , i went ahead and ordered this one . it seemed like it was made of durable material , and looked snazzy . when it came in the mail today , it was stuffed in a first class envelope with another t-shirt [ which i really like ! ] . i was anxious to see what it was like . this jacket is /literally/ made of the material used for fedex envelopes . sounds cool , huh ? the jacket is extremely thin , and feels like you 're wearing a paper bag . while i appreciate the prompt service of the people at andrew christian , they will probably see my jacket returned within the next couple of weeks
apparel	coat was of very cheap quality . the fur around hood was matted . no way i would wear or recommend this coat . it went staight to good will . i guess you get what you pay for . unless it is free you are paying too much
apparel	the sleeves on this fleece are very long . i have a 34 '' sleeve and a medium nearly covered my entire hands . not practical if you want to play any sports with this fleece . i returned mine
apparel	i ordered this item on september 10 , 2006 . as of january 12 , 2007 i have still not received the ordered item but the pictures of it sure are nice . one star is one star too many
apparel	i had never ordered from this company before . i have now ordered quite a few things from them . for the price , everything has been very attractive . some of the sizes run a bit small . this dress is very sweet , the paprika color is an orange , but i ordered 3 of these in different colors . nice to wear around the house during the summer . ( i also ordered a nice dress in eggplant , but it is really brown , alright with me , a nice dress . ) customer service was very good to me , and i even received a coupon for 3 free magazine subscriptions , as i had ordered over a certain amount from newport news . i am happy with the price vs. quality of all of their things . shipping was very speedy . for these prices you do not get the quality of neiman 's , sak 's , or bloomie 's - but you get many more nice , simple , summer dresses , of a decent quality . i think that newport news offers good value , and service for the money
apparel	i bought two of these bags so far . both have failed at the plastic fastener , one arm just snapped in no time . the bag itself is ok , but the plastic parts on the belt are really cheap ... i wont buy a third one .
apparel	i am very happy with the swimsuit . delivery was as stated . fits wonderfully . the only problem was once i was wearing it , a little of the edge of one of the cups was showing , but i tucked it in whenever it was noticeable . i was very happy that the suit fit nicely because i was a little worried of having to return for a different size and paying shipping . the size i ordered was the size i normally wear and as i said , it fit great
apparel	the collar stays are great ! they came in a convenient little container , and now i 'm not searching all over the laundry room floor for the collar stays that fell out of my husband 's dress shirts . the different lengths were helpful because he has different style shirts , and the collar stays came very quickly
apparel	great grip , cool rugged look , comfortable enough for regular winter use as well . was about $ 80 when i got it though . might not be the best option around for $ 130
apparel	i received my sunglasses last week , they are increibles but they arrived in deficient conditions . they have three lines on them , and simply i feel that i lost my money . i think that you should pay attention to the way eyeglasses are packed for transportatio
apparel	i absolutely agree with brett a. warner these replacements feel horrible . they do n't have the instant great feeling you got when you put the 991 's on . i bought them at a local store which did not take returns . so they just sit in the closet . if you do purchase these make sureyou can return them because you will . i wear a 11 1/2
apparel	the tiffany 's version is super expensive . these are clean and simple . they get the job done
apparel	incorrect color was shown on the website . it has since been added but it wasnt at the time of my purchase .
apparel	i purchased this to replace my husband 's favorite keyfob from american eagle , which was almost identical ( and lasted ten years , incidentally ) . this one fell apart after two months . time for a trip to the local leathersmith..
apparel	super comfortable . provides great support/coverage . love the front zipper . no fighting to get over your head .
apparel	i have several jackets . they are well made , warm and i would n't wear any other . long lasting and look good with anything
apparel	got this for my wife , well really for me.and boy oh boy did i enjoy seeing her walk around the house in this all weekend.. thanks amazon
apparel	poor design and fit , such that after 4-5 wears , the front of both shoes wore out - into a hole . not recommended
apparel	this sandle is very comfortable and attractive . i would recommend it to anyone looking for this type of sandle
apparel	buyers be aware that the picture does not show the correct shoe . the real shoe has an ankle strap . also , the shoe seemed to run a half size smaller . i had to return the shoe and lose out on shipping costs
apparel	the shorts i bought came way over my belly button . made me look like a funky old man . i returned them . otherwise the sizing was good .
apparel	i got this because i thought it was a good deal , but the clothes were n't very cute and were n't good quality . i gave them all away , i do n't recommend
apparel	i wore these once and got a huge hole in the toe . should not happen at nearly $ 6 a pair and a logo of gold toe
apparel	the sole of the my shoe started to wear out only after three days of use . i wo n't recommend it to anyone
apparel	i made a poopie in my pantys so you are mean i love camo hats i 'm 5 and i live in new york city in a apratmant that is fancy so you are stupiodo haeds.ps im in the army
apparel	my friend was very happy with them . they are very good quality , and they fit him for the most part . the only issue we had was the length of the arms . they were a little too long . other than that , we were pleased . they got here in time for christmas , and they were just what he wanted
apparel	the foam padding does not have enough consistancy . it stays compressed with in a short period of time . not recommended
apparel	while you might like this bag as a shoulder bag , the adjustable straps do not work well as a backpack
apparel	the color you think you purchased might turned out to be completely different . i recently ordered a blue one . from the image , i was expecting a light baby blue skin . but when i finally got it , it 's a dark navy blue . it looks nothing like the one shown . also , it 's constantly attracting dust . i am very disappointe
apparel	i received the wrong size and color . i returned the product and was told that a refund would be credited to my account ... ..i am still waiting ... ..was told that amazon forbids seller to ship a replacement item
apparel	these sox are the best my husband has ever used . he has asked for me to buy more and he has thrown all his other over the calf sox into the trash . he has been in construction for almost 30 yrs and has never been happy w/any sox i have found for him until now . these make him very happy ! ! thank you
apparel	very ordinary robe compared to picture and descripton . if plush means thick material this is not . it is low quality thin material with a warning to wash in cold.any terry robe i have had before was thicker and better made -- sears , j.c. penney.does not llook durable
apparel	i do n't recommend you make purchases here . i spent $ 61 on these items and have only recieved two . there has been no explanation as to what happened to the rest of my order , or my money . patiently i 've waited for over a month for my items to arrive and nothing
apparel	no lace collar as advertised . cheap , nylon-like fabric . not worth the price
apparel	love the shirt ! this was a birthday present for my son . we are so impressed with the quality that we will definitely use this amazon site again
apparel	these panties fit great wash after wash. great quality and very smooth under dress or pant
apparel	el producto lo recibi en perfectas condiciones , excelente comprarle a ustedes.- saludos maryury
apparel	i got two problems with this here lingeree : 1 . that model at the top of the page is sparkin hot , how come it never looks the same on my girlfriend ? eh ? false advertizing if ya ask me . their shold be a law that all lingeree models hafta weigh 250 and have a bit of hair on their legs like my woman does . or a warnin label `` objects inside this lingeree are uglier than they appear . '' 2 . i paid $ 14.95 and there aint enough there to blow yer nose on . my suggestion : go for the crotchless or the bustless or the fishnet , but all three is just not enough lingeree and too much girlfriend..
apparel	our son love this pair of shoes , he wears it to church or just to a party . he said that they are nice and comfy he can run with them because the have rubber soles . we think that they are elegant as well . we give 5 stars for them ! ! very good
apparel	was disappointed with the color of the shoe , because there is a difference between the left and right shoe . at first i thought the wrong models were packed in the box . but no , it 's the shade of the leather that is different , left shoe is darker than the right shoe . being in singapore , it will be expensive for me to ship back for replacement . ( i had the shoe delivered to my brother-in-law in l.a. , who brought it back to singapore for me
apparel	great delivery of a quality product and the speedy service is one reason i still use amazon today is b/c of sellers and products like this 2 thumbs up !
apparel	when i move around , i sure do n't need a front closure that comes undone ... many times a day ? ! the hook on this bra needs to be changed to a snap closure ! perfect bra in every other sense , but a self unhooking bra ? no good
apparel	do n't get me wrong these are nice high end shoes , however , i was sent an ugly red color instead of the yellow displayed on the products site . nowhere on the products site was the ( red ) `` outdoor plein air '' color shown as a choice
apparel	if you have the body to show for it , by all means wear it alone
apparel	i was not pleased with these . i bought mine at target , and within one month the soles of both sandals were cracked . no refund , since they were used .
apparel	i purchased the crocs butter thinking it would be something special just for crocs shoes . as soon as i opened the package , i noticed the crocs butter is just like any other shoe buffer/cleaner with the black sponge . i already own two shoe buffers , one of which i received free with purchase from a local shoe store . needless to say , i returned the crocs butter , since it 's not worth $ 4.95 , plus $ 10 shipping , which i was not refunded . what a crock
apparel	although the dress may seem to fit the ideal dress from the movie , how to lose a guy in 10 days , the cut of the dress leaves extra fabric right under the area of the bust . this made me look awkward and did not fit well . do n't waste your money on the shipping that you will have to pay for when you return it as i did .
apparel	this workout is short but you will feel `` worked out '' when done . tina cues well and the workout flows very smoothly . no awkward transitions . the ball is used for both total body toning and 4 limb cardio . your core and abs get a great workout too with both traditional and functional moves . i enjoyed the change of using the ball instead of dumbells . definitely `` shocked '' the muscles
apparel	material was not overly thick and designs were great ! look good on my daughter
apparel	comfy , tough , lightweight , wrinkly ( like me ) . surprisingly durable considering how thin the fabric is . good stitching . velcro® back pockets will save your wallet ! does n't offer lots of stupid exterior loops and gear-freak cargo pockets . not for the tidy country-club set who need creases on everything , but just perfect for active soccer dads or when the family hound insists on playing fetch with muddy logs and the like
apparel	they were slightly small and a tad too stiff . but very cut
apparel	at first i was bugged by how sticky this was , but boy did it work ! they gave me 1/2 ounce tube in the hospital ( and charged me $ 9 for it , but that 's another story ! ) it moisturizes and protects your nipples from chafing while nursing , and does n't bother baby a bit . take my advice , bring your own tube to the hospital to avoid being over-charged !
apparel	these are nice sweatshirts . good quality and the prices is half what you might pay for a champion brand . it is oversized so order your normal size and do n't count on much shrinkage
apparel	the new balance men 's m587 running shoe has been an excellent running shoe . it has a built in rollbar that prevent shin-splints and the shoes are extremely comfortable to run-in . i have been buying this shoe for over four years and two deployments to iraq . i recommend this shoe to any runner that runs 4-5 times a week .
apparel	i have run in a pair of 991s for the last 5 years . i was disappointed to hear that the 991 was replaced by the 992 . i purchased a pair of 992 hoping for similar comfort and fit . the 992s are nice to look at , but the similarities stop there . the fit is horrible even after going down from a d to a b width . the cushioning i 've come to love in the 991 is simiply not there in the 992 . i had a new balance representative tell me point blank that he would n't recommend the 992 for running at all . what is that old adage ? if it 's not broke do n't fix it . did new balance even test this shoe before implementing it ? 991 lovers beware , this shoe is not for you . i guess the quest begins for a new running shoe
apparel	we ordered this product , and paid for expedited shipping . 8 days later , it had not arrived . their explanation was that it was 2 day shipping from the day of shipping , but it still took 3 days to get around to shipping . the backpack missed the giftee , and it had to be shipped again to catch up to her
apparel	i am very happy with the above purchase.i am very impressed with the arrival and condition of the item . i like it because it fits well and when you wear it , you feel quite cool . will shop agai
apparel	who has n't wanted a pair of these since they were a little girl ? so glamorous , girly , and sexy . i was surprised how comfortable they are on the foot . they really do feel like slippers , just with the heel as a bonus . i normally wear a 6w or a 6 ½ , so these are a little snug , but not too bad . so glad i bought them- two pairs red black . pink will be next..
apparel	these go on real easy , and come off real easy . they feel like a regular cotton sock except that they wick sweat away . i 'm ordering more
apparel	minimzer is correct , i bought this bra in a 38ddd and it made me look more like a d or dd . it lifted and minim1zed my breasts . my only complaint is that the cup was rounded but the lining made a barely noticeable point . if you want your breasts to appear one or two sizes smaller then this is the bra for you .
apparel	this cologne is the perfect balance of wood and sweetness . it is not overpowering , and it is very masculine . i bought it for my boyfriend , and found that on him it 's even more potent ! it 's aa great fragranc
apparel	the trunks look great as long as you do n't get them wet because once you get them wet they become see-through . i guess that could be advantageous for some , but i was looking for something to wear on public beaches
apparel	i got these cause i am pregnant and trying to find cloths that fit is kinda hard but with these i do n't have a problem because it has adjustable snaps for the wast
apparel	these fit a tiny bit loose but the comfort level is great . shoes at amazon.com are one of my favorite on-line purchases , great prices
apparel	this is a great fit for a silk shirt . i thought it would not be a close fit being silk , but i was wrong . this item fits snug and looks great on . both alone and layered . i would recommend this shirt to people that like the look of a tight tank .
apparel	the fabric in these slacks allow you to sit for hours and then stand knowing your slacks look neat and freshly pressed . they wash beautifully and require little or no ironing . my husband wishes all of his slacks wore this well . the hidden elastic makes the slacks just as comfortable when you are sitting down or bending down as they are when you are standing . frankly i wish i could find slacks for women that were this well made especially at the price hagaar offers . haagar has done a terrific job again
apparel	i ordered 3 products from dance now ... none of them fit being at least one size too small . when i contacted dance now regarding this issue they told me that these shoes are sized for women . men need 2 sizes larger in their street shoe size . i found no reference to that detail on the amazon website . dance now representative told me it is referenced on their own website . but amazon does not make that fact known . so now i have 2 orders i have to pay shipping to dance now as well as their exhchange cost . i am a bit unhappy over this
apparel	brand new , tags and everything ! ! ! arrived within a week , no glitches . just like ordering new from catalog . will search and order again for merchandise all at fairer price or even 50 cut of new brand name items that either are not in stock in your size , or ca n't be found in store or are marked up 20 % 0r more ! luuvv itt ! ! ! ! ! ! ! bonni
apparel	very portable . great picture . easy to operate . all the accessories you need . great sound . playes dvd 's from sony camcorder . very happy with the system . am looking forward to using this camping and on vacation .
apparel	i received an email from txshirts stated that i should direct all inquiries to csr @ txshirts.com . i did this on two occasions and received no reply . customer service finally contacted me only to ask why i had left negative feedback on amazon . they stated they never received any email from me . their gym shorts were not as described . the description said `` covered elastic waistband '' . instead , i received an `` uncovered '' elastic waistband that digs into my skin and leaves indentations on my skin . their response ? i should pay for return shipping in order to get my money back . but who should pay for return shipping when an item is falsely advertised ? ?
apparel	i love this case . i purchased many cases before , but this offers the best protection at a very low price . thanks . covercas
apparel	this is the only haynes t-shirt that does not bunch at the back of the neck . it is light and drapes well . but it is too light for printing .
apparel	i was excited to finally find a black nursing bra . this bra fits horribly . do not buy if you are dd/e cup ! this bra is uncomfortable and does n't hold your goods properly
apparel	i ordered these robes ( in white and ivory ) as christmas gifts for my mother and father-in-law . they arrived quickly and beautifully packaged . last week , i was told that they loved their thick and luxurious robes - they feel as if they are at a spa . i was concerned about the one size fits all sizing , but i was told that she loved the extra coverage ( she 's probably a size 14-16 ) and this is one of the few robes that goes around his expanding waistline ( i buy him xl sweaters ) . i will order one for myself as soon as i am in the market for a robe .
apparel	the upper portion of the boots which is supposed to hug your calf is ridiculously huge . the shoe portion fit . i have relatively normal-sized calves and i was swimming in these boots . i immediately returned tham
apparel	extremely poor quality cloth . very bad color . it looks used . never ever buy any items from this vendo
apparel	i have been looking for a pair of docs for a while . i know they are a new globalized company , and i am not necessarily against that . i am disappointed that you ca n't get a better range of colors . i 've had a few blue pairs and a lovely green . but colors are not really available now except on high tops emblazoned with the brand name . an abomination for sure ! these shoes are very comfortable and apparently well-made . my single quibble with the black pair i got here on amazon has to do with the flimsiness of the tongue . i like a nice strong tongue . ( and who does n't ? ) whatever they saved on material here may have been a mistake . on the other hand , maybe the sole will wear out first ( or it will be a dead heat ) . never thought i 'd buy shoes online , but amazon and the doctor made it happen .
apparel	bra was more padded than i thought when ordering . descriptions of products are not adequate . thanks , though ... love shopping on amazo
apparel	i bought these shoes and wore them to my first fitting . by the end of my fitting , my feet were throbbing , red , and pinched . literally , my pinky toe was purple . i bought my true size , but i still do n't think these shoes would 've been wearable even with a size larger . they must just be really narrow
apparel	i couldnt resist these shoes for the price ... i 've had good experience with bandolino branded shoes . i have two other pairs that are stylish and very comfortable . sure enough , this pair of boots are very comfortable too ! the color is a great burnished bronze , that is a great neutral color to wear ( plus metallics are in fashion again ) . the zip-up is easy , and the calf is roomy . i 'm very happy with them , and would recommend them to anyone who does n't want to spend 100 's of dollars , but wants to get the look and comfort of expensive shoes
apparel	it is a comfortable little t-shirt dress for 9 bucks . be careful because the sizes run small . if you get it , buy a size larger than you normally would
apparel	genuine leather with fur lining are about the warmest things you can possibly wear ! an excellent choice for extremely cold winter weather , well worth the money spent .
apparel	everyone loved me in these glasses for our `` old fashioned banquet '' ! they completed my outfit , great price and a speedy delivery - which i really needed
apparel	i am technically a 32jj ( per some lingerie store lady ) , but have worn 34 dd and ddd since high school ( i 'm 27 now ) and have been on the hunt for a good nursing bra ( 33 weeks pregnant today ) . i tried the `` medela seamless underwire full fit nursing bra '' in a 34g and 34h . this one is the most supportive , but is an underwire ( which after 8 hours , i ca n't wait to take off - and i 've always been a committed underwire wearer ) and the h cup fits , but i 'm nervous about if it will fit once my milk really comes in . i also tried the `` fancee free foam support soft cup nursing bra , '' which i also got in a 34g and 34h is not the most supportive , but is comfortable ( i wear this one to bed , around the house , etc. ) . so , regarding the goddess bra - i just got a 34g and yes , the cups are a little big , which i 'm so thankful for because that will certainly allow for some growth and they are n't so big that my breasts look silly through shirts . not to mention , the cup part that is looser is mostly around the nipple ( i 've been instructed to begin wearing a nipple shield , so it allows for room for that so-not-inconspicuous item to be ) . my favorite part is the back portion , which is a stretchy cotton and does not dig into my ribs by the end of the day like the others . it is also pretty supportive , maybe a 9 out of 10 in supportiveness compared to the medela - but steps above the fancee free . i will likely buy one more g and an h in this style - and call it a day on buying nursing bras because i finally found what i 'm looking for . i 'd recommend buying one that is a cup size below what you normally wear if you 're looking to wear it right now and you may have to wear a size up after milk comes in . this bra really got me excited - enough that after 4 years of ordering from amazon , this is the first review i was ever compelled to write . hope you find the same success with this bra , too . good luck
apparel	at first i thought i would n't like this bra because it has to be pulled over you head to put it on . however , this is the most comfortable bra i bought , and i bought a lot of different kinds . this is perfect for engorgement and just plain daily comfort
apparel	i do n't own this gear bag , and i 'm not going to buy it even though it looks interesting . would this be a suitable carry-on bag , or would i have to check it ? i do n't know . the dimensions are not given anywhere . i want to know more about the products i order
apparel	i love the colts , but this sweatshirt is supposed to be a large , it is the wierdest fitting sweatshirt i have efer seen . the shoulders are to big and the neck is to tight . i wear a large but i cant wear this shirt because it looks so awkward
apparel	this was at 1oth birthday gift for my son . we are california transplants living in texas , and no one here , at the time , had any idea that kobe had even changed his number from 8 to 24 . it was a nightmare ( and a lot of driving around ) trying to find kb 's 24 . i found it on your site and the product was just what i expected , no surprises . my son loves it !
apparel	it 's true that you get what you pay for . the good thing i can say about this product is that the price is right . but the quality was low and the fit was poor . however , if you are strapped for money then they are certainly wearable . but get a half size smaller than you usually would get
apparel	love them . they feel as comfortable as tennis shoes , and give the right support when doing a lot of walking , but at the same time they look more hip and dressier then tennis shoes
apparel	these slippers are very comfy and fit true to size . however , the fabric part between the toes is not anchored to the solid part of the slipper . it 's sewn to the terry lining covering this solid part and when i walk , the slippers fall off my feet . i will not purchase these slippers again .
apparel	i quesss for the price you cant beat it , but i think it should have said patch leather , or leather pieces , also the size runs larger , than regular coats , xl was really more like an xxl.but like i said for the price you cant beat it , i really should have invested more and got a better coat . thank you dlan
apparel	this item was durable , warm , the right size as advertised and the right price .
apparel	it 's october 8th , 2006 . the detroit tigers have just defeated the new york yankees to advance to the american league championship series . people counted the tigers out . everyone thought the yankees would walk into comerica ballpark and put a serious damper on the success the tigers have produced all season long . nope . did n't happen . the tigers won 95 games this year . no one thought the tigers advancing this far was possible , but when you have excellent stars such as magglio ordonez , curtis granderson , ivan rodriguez , marcus thames , craig monroe and kenny rogers , you ca n't lose . the manager jim leyland also played a major part in helping to reshape the tigers as a team , and give them much-needed direction . he was probably the main reason they won so many games . the tigers are now a team everyone can love- not just detroit fans . tv stations are now playing tigers games again and reminding people that yes , the tigers are still around . the fact that the tigers have n't been mentioned for the last 10 years shows that the fans may have forgotten all about the team , but beating the yankees last night was solid proof the team is back , and threatening . proof that the tigers can hang with the big boys . the celebration after the final out in game 4 was wonderful . everyone on the team lifted jim leyland on their shoulders and proudly walked around the field , while the fans celebrated and cheered indicating they still remember those successful championship years a long time ago , and obviously still support their home team . it got extremely crazy when the team decided to spray champagne at the audience , and they enjoyed it ! even a cop wanted to be sprayed . the celebration supposedly lasted an hour . this vintage crest t-shirt should proudly be worn by you . i want you to take a trip to new york city wearing this shirt and walk down the street so everyone can see how much of a proud , loyal detroit tigers fan you are . the days of watching them lose game after game are finally over . long live the tigers . make sure you buy this shirt to celebrate the wonderful run the tigers had in the season of 2006 . you need to wear orange if you live in the detroit area .
apparel	nice to put on after a long day of work or after being outside shoveling the snow .do reccomend
apparel	i have been a 34 size for my entire life and this bra fits terrible ... the fabric is stiff and so uncomfortable..i could not wait to take it off . champion should stick to making sports bra ... do not buy this bra or you will suffer . plus , it looks much thinner in the picture..it is really thick ... it feels like a maternity bra . ugh
apparel	these socks do not fit the sizes specified . the elastic is so tight that you can hardly get them on your feet . i gave them to my 12 yr. old son and they were too tight on him also , i threw them out . this is the first and last time i will buy those socks . the reebok sneakers are great though
apparel	i 'm 19 years old and saw these at bloomingdales the other day and decided to buy them . i took them home , tried them on , and i was absolutely amazed . they are a bit of a low rise , but that only adds to the flattery . and i like my underwear that way . there are a bunch of different sizes you can button the sling to , and once you find the perfect fit , you can hardly even feel that it 's there . i give it a perfect score , and i am definatley going to buy more of these
apparel	i like the look of the shoes and the shiny parts are easy to clean , although the cloth parts are difficult to keep clean . i have a high arch and they seem to support well so i would say over all they were a good choice
apparel	i regret to say that i did not receive the shoes.. ! !
apparel	the main thing here is that the bag shipped with out the strap . i bought it for my wife to carry `` all that stuff '' to work . with out the strap it does not work . i requested another one , got it , no strap . on the plus side is the bag looked and felt as pictured and the packing was , if any thing , over done . gre
apparel	we bought this for our 13 month old for christmas and she loves it . it is extremely soft . her favorite part is the cell phone that rings . the compact also squeaks . i love that it is all soft so that she can not hurt herself with it . this is a perfect gift for a 1-year-old girl
apparel	i was looking for the lightest , slimmest possible wallet , and the dopp getaway is just about perfect . for the first couple of weeks i kept sticking my hand in my pocket to make sure it was still there - it 's that unobtrusive . it 's made out of soft , thin leather ( so thin , actually , that the embossed lettering on my credit cards shows through the surface ) . that might affect the durability , but it certainly keeps the overall bulk of the wallet down . the illustration shows a large embossed crest , but mine arrived with only discreet lettering saying `` dopp '' at the bottom - a significant improvement , in my mind . the wallet has pockets for 3 credit cards and a little pouch , open on the top and one side , to hold your cash . there 's also one additional pocket that 's ideal for other documents you just have to carry . the only slight negative for me was the caramel-colored vinyl lining of the cash pocket . i do n't know why they used such a low-class material there . it 's invisible from the outside , and not really offensive , but if i could change one thing , that would be it . i debated knocking off a star for it , but the overall function and appearance of the wallet is so excellent that i thought it deserved the full five stars . overall , if you 're disciplined about what you carry , you 'll love the small size and low bulk of this wallet .
apparel	for me , they are very difficult to put on . i have to use a long shoe horn . they are n't tight , in fact they are so wonderfully comfortable and warm . they look great if you like the ugg look . i 'm hoping when they loosen up , they will be easier to put on . the top scrunches down when i put my foot in that is why it is so hard to get them on . it could be me though ! otherwise , i love everything else about them . van c
apparel	i got the flip flops for my granddaughter for christmas she wore her cheap ones out from wal-mart and her mother told her white is summer only and no one could find white ones right now i told her i bet her i could and so i did and she loves them and so did all her friends at school . we know it is winter but so far in indiana it is not bad so you can wear flip flops and tanks for now . thank you for the great gift .
apparel	i am a 44dd i am having the hardest time finding a good bra ... i ordered this one and i am a little dissapointed . the underwires in the front poke out and make it look like i have these bones sticking straight out of my chest . everthing else is ok ... no complaints other than the underwire not laying flush with my chest bone
apparel	i buy these wherever i can find them . it 's a bit of a tribute to my aunt , for her middle name , but wish i could find them more frequently .
apparel	great slippers , very comfortable . i love the fact that the front is open in case i just got a pedicure . and the black ones are perfect because they do n't show dirt like the white ones
apparel	unfortunately i never received the product i purchased . the company claimed that they sent via usps and i never received it . so as far as the company is concerned i am out of the money i spent , plus the product . i have received no satisfaction
apparel	good quality for the great price . bought for my 10 year old son and should fit perfect . item was on backorder but still received in less than a week
apparel	waited weeks and still waiting to date for a credit . very unhappy with return policy . wondering if i 'll ever get my credit
apparel	the wheels on the bag lasted less than two months . the bag is now basically unusable .
apparel	i love these crocs ! they are much more comfortable than the original style , and i like the two tone color combo . i wear them even in the winter
apparel	i mailed this for a shower gift so i did n't see the item but was told it was very cute
apparel	poor quality and flared like a maternity top.if you order from lands end thru amazon and the item goes on price break , several of the items i have ordered have gone on a price break.lands end will not ajust the price , you will need to send the item back pay for more shipping and they will re ship , they do n't charge for shpping and they act like they are doing you a favor , the customer service will even tell you that you should have ordered from the direct.the customer service will do little for you since you ordered it from amazon and they will tell you until they and you are blue in the face , that they can not help you because it was ordered from amazon.good luck
apparel	i received the wrong size originally . the company was prompt in sending me another dress , however , i received a third dress which i refused by mail and i am trying to get my credit card adjusted . the dress is lovely
apparel	this shoe is cut right underneath the ankle . everytime you walk the edge of the shoe rubs into your ankle and causes extreme discomfort and blisters .
apparel	these were really easy for my little girl to put on herself . they were well make and very light weight . i like the ridges in the surface and hope they will help keep her feet dry and prevent the shoes from getting super stinky
apparel	the leather was good quality . the wallet was well constructed . i gave it as a gift and it turned out better than i it looked on the internet . grade a product
apparel	beware , the size is not true size fit my small turn out to be something that fits like a large from some other brands . this is not a small , it 's loose fitting and it 's a straight line cut . it 's really bad.it 's so disappointing . everything doesnt holds in places , it doesnt look like the photo at all . the materials is nice but the fittting is beyond horrid . dont buy this dress unless you are really curvy , and if you are a medium , you need a small for this dress , and it will still fit loosly on you . that 's how big of a dress this is . i 'm returning it
apparel	whoever said the 80 's are making a comeback was n't lying ! i love american apparel clothing especially this deep v-neck shirt . just know that it really is deep ! i 'm only in my twenties but i almost feel like an older man when i wear this shirt ; cut lower than other v-necks your chest hair is bound to hang out ! if your cool with that then go buy the shirt cause it ca n't get any more comfortable than it already is ! honestly , i probably wo n't wear it anywhere other than the gym and home , but i still love it
apparel	i bought this as a birthday gift for my husband , and while i was n't expecting the best quality in the world ( because of the price ) , i was still a little disappointed . the company did a wonderful job of packaging/shipping the product-even the buttons were individually protected . i paid for expedited shipping , but they still cut the deadline close , so i was nervous about it arriving in time . the lining on the inside is thick and bulky so it is n't as streamlined as the pic implies , and tends to make the leather bulge a bit in places . ( it was lumpy-looking even in the box . ) removing the zip-out lining does n't change this -- there 's significant padding in the shoulders . it 's also a shinier leather than expected . sizing chart seems a bit inaccurate -- i ordered a size larger than he normally wears in coats ( which is a size larger than his regular clothing ) , but it was still too snug in places , lining or not . overall , though , i 'd say i got what i paid for , if you do n't count the unusually high shipping charges . ( even standard shipping and handling charges were unusually high compared to other companies .
apparel	i love my clarks and i can get such good prices through amazon . i have bought two pairs of clarks with amazon and i plan on buying more in the future . bett
apparel	i bought these to replace an identical pair that i 've been wearing for ten years . i got the old ones in london , and they were made in england . this new pair was made in china . they have changed ... some for the good and some for the bad . there is now more toe room , which i like . however , both heel pads were ill fitted and loose . i had to trim them and stick them back in with super glue . i 'm starting to really break them in now and i think i 'll love them for years to come . they provide good ankle support and keep my feet warm . buyer beware that these boots come very very stiff , and will take time to break in . when i first get them , i just wear them around the house occasionally until i can actually wear them out for a bit . if you try to wear them too long when you first get them , they will most definitely wear blisters on your feet . break them in slowly and you 'll have a wonderfully comfortable pair of boots to last a long time .
apparel	i bought these for my husband and the color said rinse so i thought regular jean color . in fact they were so dark that they almost look black . i have washed then about 5 times but they wo n't fade
apparel	my son runs true to size on most clothing including childrens place but the pjs run very small and when i held them up to each other the different patterns were sized different . at 5 months he is still wearing 3-6 mo in most pjs but already grown our of childrens place 6-9 mo pjs . i bought several pairs and some of them he never could wear . buy a different brand unless you can go to the store and actually try them on
apparel	this was a poorly made product . even when left still on a table , north took about 2 min to locate - something unusable for most people who are out on the run and need to know where north is , now . also it advertises a thermometer on the packaging , but there was n't one i could find . i ended up returning this for a full refund
apparel	i bought this tank in red the color of the fabric is wonderfully vibrant . the quality of the fabric is so nice that i wore the top to dinner with a printed skirt received several compliments on the outfit . caution ! this style runs about 1 size small . athletica offers excellent , personalized customer service and every one of the 10 tank tops i ordered were of a quality for which some brands cost as much as $ 38 .
apparel	i purchased six of these chairs in august for myself and my friends before the start of the college football season for tailgaiting . they were all made by this manufacturer ( north pole ) and had different nfl logos on them ( i only bought one through amazon , the others were bought through different companies due to availability issues ) . at the first game of the season , my chair ( steelers ) broke . at the second game of the season , two more chairs ( bengals and broncos ) broke . they were not misused and no weight limits were exceeded . they all broke in the same exact place ; the plastic pieces at the base of the legs all cracked . therefore , 3 out of 6 broke within probably less than 3-5 hours . needless to say , at $ 25- $ 30 each i would recommend prospective buyers to spend their money elsewhere
apparel	this bag was not what i expected . the leather was cheap and it was n't really big enough to fit much . i would not recommend this bag if you want it to hold a lot of items/paper .
apparel	extremely disappointed in this bag . it was n't even heavily loaded , just some folders with papers , keys , phone , make up , wallet . on the very first use the strap broke before i even got home . also , the stitching is coming loose . also the strap is not leather . a big waste of money .
apparel	i purchased the scarlett version of this bag more than two years ago , and it 's still in perfect condition ! the color does n't fade when you wash it , and it 's the most durable bag i 've ever owned . i will not , refuse to , absolutely can not make me carry a purse , but i carry this bag everyday . the very front zipper pocket is great for change , the small zipper holds my keys and cell and a host of other small items i always seemed to be losing before , and the large pocket is big enough to fit several medium sized paperbacks in . it 's perfect for everyday use , and will last forever . the `` backpack straps '' are comfortable and have never broken . i was so excited when i found this on amazon , and in every color ! before , the selection was red and black only , so this is fabulous ! buy this bag , you will love it
apparel	i loved the look of the boot . the price was great . i guess you get what you pay for . they run a size small . there is also some sort of design flaw with the zipper function and location . you break out in a sweat trying to get the boots on and off . believe me , i tried . i really wanted to keep the boots based on the look . once on , they were really awkward to walk around in because the wedge had no give at all . i am pretty good in heels being in a band and always wearing some kind of trendy shoe . i tend to be pretty easy . i just could not make these work ! sorry
apparel	with a title like 'swirl skirt , ' you 'd expect the fabric to be able to , well , swirl . but the fabric is stiff and not very comfortable . plus , the cut ( of the size 12 at least ) was awkward , giving my tummy a bubble that was n't even there . and the last thing i want is for my tummy to look bigger than it actually is . so i do n't recommed this item
apparel	warning ! ! ! can not use button features to operate zen player because leather case is way too tight ! you can hardly get the player into the case so no amount of time or breaking in period is going to fix the problem . sadly , it 's like having a pair of shoes that are so tight you have to remove them so you can walk .

apparel	my 9 year old nephew told me he wanted `` under armour '' for christmas . i had no idea what he was talking about . i asked - `` under arm deoderant '' ? `` undershirt '' ? i was ever the un-cool aunt for not knowing what he wanted . i found out that 3 of my friends experienced the same thing . ; ) the shirt runs very tight , and even though my nephew is smaller for his age , the large just barely fit him . he asked for a second one for his birthday ( and so did my sister , so she could get the shirt off of him and wash it ) . the kid loves it , and if he gives it 5 stars , so do i .
apparel	they run much smaller than birkenstocks . i sent the size 44 back ( which is comfy in the comparable model in birkenstocks ; is it the boston ? ) and got the 45 and it still feels small . the upper is ok , the shoe is n't the best made thing but is adequate ; it 's just the size thing that bothered me
apparel	this was called learning the hard way not to believe the hype and not to buy shoes on line . the fit was awful , there is no cushioning to speak of in the soles and other than looking good off my feet these shoes are useless
apparel	in the picture it shows of this bra it looked as if it was low cut and comfortable , but it shows it in a smaller size than the one i wear , so once i opened the box i was very suprised that it was so huge and cumbersome . it could not possibly be worn with a low cut top , which is why i bought it . if you were a size 34d or above , beware
apparel	very comfortable and sexy . hanky panky is the standard in comfortable lace
apparel	used the jump rope maybe 3-4 times and the handle broke off , you would expect a quality jump rope for the price but do n't count on it . then again it could have just been mine
apparel	i was a bit dissapointed , i know its my fault , i did n't pay to much attention to the tag that is not the color they show the one you are ordering , it should be the same thing you 're looking physically the thing you 're gon na buy ! ! ! i saw this beautifull gray/orange stripes , and got green /white stripÈs . its very easy to put a picture of the product ! ! regard
apparel	if you are a grandma on a budget , it can be difficult to find useful items for grandsons . i thought that this was a good buy at $ 7.99 for my 11-year old grandson for either his birthday or christmas . i would have given five stars , but there was not a complete list of teams offered
apparel	it 's thin , so you can wear something over it . and it helps keep the chill out . i wear it cycling and golfing
apparel	i love the feel and multiple spaces available the only problem/fear is that i have had things fall out of it when snapped and string tight . i would give it a 5 star if there was a zipper option to keep items secured
apparel	these are comfortable slippers that -- with composite soles -- can take you out on the deck , to the front steps or even your driveway to pick up the morning newspaper . your feet will stay warm but not uncomfortably so . they 're even nice to wear when temps are a little higher because the clog design fits loosely at the heal so you can let your feet `` breath '' a little fresh air . nice value for the price
apparel	these underwear were supposed to be size 34 , but i could barely shimmy them up over my legs . the fit was so tight that i could not wear them , even though all my other underwear is size 34 and fits fine . they are also made of a very thin and flimsy grade of cotton , and the fly does not provide enough overlap to keep everything where it belongs . if you must try these , buy them at least 2 sizes larger - but you would do better with another product
apparel	it has a very loose fit and i feel a little silly , but pulling it out of the package i totally forgot how exactly this thing should look on me . it is made like a very unflattering potato sack sadly
apparel	bought this boot for varying terrain and temperature conditions . it is stable , comfortable , provides good traction , and is warm without being sweaty . i would strongly recommend this boot .
apparel	good quality . beautiful color . however had a side zipper which my husband did n't like as much as a top zipper
apparel	this is a fine leather bag , beautiful , comfortable ! i bought on the mfr website and saved the shipping . its a wonderful product of quality and craftsmanship ! a must have
apparel	oh my gosh ! i was so excited to see this item . my 15 year old and all of his buddies are big fans of napoleon dynamite and this t-shirt is an exact replica of the one worn during the famous election rally dance ! i will be a hit on valentine 's day with this gift !
apparel	these are lightweight cotton thermals at a good price . i wear a large in most shirts and the large size for these fits snug , especially after a wash , which is how i like it for wearing as an undershirt . if you 're buying for outerwear , you might consider going a size larger . shipping was n't 'amazon quick ' but it was reasonable - about a week if i remember right
apparel	these shoes exceeded my expectations , in that they are very lightweight . the soles are made of some kind of stiff foam instead of solid rubber . time will tell how it wears compared to rubber , but the shoes are noticeably lighter than the last pair i owned . they look good , they are very comfortable -- very little , if any , break-in time . if you like the look , it 's a safe buy -- you wo n't be disappointed with the build and feel
apparel	most sneakers these days come in two varieties -- they 're huge athletic clod-hoppers for teenieboppers , or they 're white keds or orthotic shoes for old ladies . this sneaker is the best compromise on the market today . it 's youthful without being for the young . light-weight , low-profile , wide enough for a thick sock , and it 'll get you compliments everywhere you go . my first pair is in black , and wow , they are stylish . today i wore them out shopping , and my back started hurting before my feet did . my one objection is this supposedly 'squishy ' foot bed . i do n't know if my shoes were missing that part or what , but i found the sole to be hard and inflexible . they were still _comfortable_ but it was n't like putting your feet on pillows or anything . if you do prefer a squishier footbed , i recommend a thin insert , so as not to squish your toes . i 'm not sure if they would perform well for athletics -- i 'm going to be saving mine for errands and casual nights out , but i want these in every color
apparel	i was unable to return the item because of restrictions imposed by their return policy i made a mistake by buying i
apparel	if you see the description : made in italy , be careful ! they are made in india . i have written to amazon to let them change . but if you still see made in italy , be careful ! everybody knows the difference
apparel	the moondoggies are very comfy and cute as can be ! perfect for wearing to the park with the kids but nice enough to veture out in the evening ... i am buying another pair .
apparel	the socks are very lightweight , probably would be ok for summer use but not for work or books . they were just ok . i would not purchase agai
apparel	i wrote a rave review of these the day i got them . they were absolutely terrific and gave me purchase doing yoga on a slippery rug . however , the next time i wore them for a longer session , they got stretched out . my toes kept falling out of them and they became twisted around my feet and just generally got in the way . i put on a new pair for another session and when doing any lunges or poses with my legs in a wide stance , they were very uncomfortable . oh well . the `` concept '' is great , but they do n't really work unless you 're doing very little movement . i wish someone would come up with something like this that does the job
apparel	i am a product junkie and i never would have believed i could fit all my stuff in this bag , but i did ! this bag is amazing and takes up so much less space than the assorted bags i had been using ! i am getting one of these for each of my sisters..
apparel	i was looking for a durable checkbook cover that would last for years , yet was n't going to take years to pay for ! ( ha ! ha ! ) this is a nice checkbook cover for the money . my only complaint is that it needs to have a `` tab '' to keep your check register open to the page you are working on . however , it does have a `` loop '' to keep a pen inside , you should desire to do so . all in all , a good buy
apparel	the cap is nice and presumably does what it is suppose to do by keeping my hair out of my face . however , the stitching at the seam at the back of the cap began coming apart from the day that i first used it . it hasnt torn completely ... yet . nevertheless , i would think that putting a skull cap on once with my short hair would cause a tear so sooon . i wouldnt suggest this produc
apparel	1 . packaging was shabby . 2 . the finishing was pathetic with threads hanging out . 3 . the quality and feel of the cloth was the worst i have ever seen . 4 . dont be deceived by the pictures . 5 . the end product is not worth a gift or personal use nor 25 % of the actual cost
apparel	these are exactly what i was looking for . i 've been wearing this type of ear muff for 20 years . everytime i break or lose a pair i spend months looking for its replacement . after i received my first pair , i ordered enough to last me another 20 years . i hate the around your neck ear muffs so popular these days . they are uncomfortable and they cost more
apparel	we have a big smiling rubber rat in the state store where i work , but he is n't nearly as menacing as this sucker ! in fact 's he 's kinda friendly . this guy 's a beast ... blood red eyes , sharp claws , looks like he 'd take your throat if you slipped and fell in the bathroom . no ordinary broom neccesary here , friends , no , what you need is a can of mase and a nightstick . buy this guy , set him in the windows of a dark room , and call the cops . god knows they need some useful stuff to do at night besides drink coffee and play video games . would get more stars , but he 's damn expensive
apparel	i just got these and love them . my only complaint is that they pinch/are a little narrow , even though i do n't have wide feet or regularly wear wide shoes . the dark red color is a little deeper than the picture , but that is a good thing if you want to wear these in both winter and summer . if you 're gon na buy red shoes or any other colors available , these are a great choice
apparel	ca n't believe how true to size they are . they 're quite easy to move in , and they 're simple and beautiful . not at all cheap-looking for the price . i expected less and got more
apparel	this was my second time ordering a dickies jacket and being disappointed , i will not do it again . the zipper gets stuck on a flap of material almost everytime i zip or unzip it . i contacted andrew christian over ninety days ago by e-mail and i was ignored . today i decided to send him a message through amazon and found out it was to late . i thought that the time limit was 180 days . i like everything else about the jacket , but this problem has cost me a lot of time and frustration , there must be a better brand for my money somewhere out there
apparel	i love this skirt . i wear it with my `` live a little '' denim jacket , so cute . i find it to be really figure flattering . i ordered a size 6 and it fit perfect . nice to find a denim skirt that 's a little different than the other zillions out there
apparel	i am picky about the kind of sock i put on me my son 's feet . his feet have been sized as extra wide ( ! ! ) and these socks fit wonderfully , in his size , without being stretched tight . i love the high cotton content the cushioned soles . these are well made socks i will be buying from this brand when it 's time for the next size up
apparel	i ordered these shoes for my wedding , so you can imagine my nervousness . i received them within a week and fell in love ! i 've shown them to my bridal party and my mother and have received nothing but raves ! even at the shoe repair where i had no-skids put on them and the dress shop where i had a fitting no one could take their eyes off my shoes ! order a 1/2 size smaller
apparel	i bought two of these bags so far . both have failed at the plastic fastener , one arm just snapped in no time . the bag itself is ok , but the plastic parts on the belt are really cheap ... i wont buy a third one .
apparel	i wore this shirt for one day every other week and after five months the collar points have worn through and the white material underneath is showing through . it 's a blue shirt so i ca n't wear it to work now . unacceptable in a shirt of this price
apparel	the fanny pack looks nice but the belt did not adjust to be small enough for my hips . i am a 5'6 '' 120 lb . small boned female . the company offered to exchange it , however did not offer any others with cell phone holder . now i will have to pay return shipping plus 4.95 restocking fee to return this item . i did not see the information to learn of this fee before my purchase and am not happy to learn it now
apparel	i love this shoe ! it 's a perfect heel height , classic pointed toe , comfortable design with coverage enough to enclose even a wider foot . perfectly proportioned with all-day comfort . if i win lotto , i plan to order every color with spares in case it 's ever discontinued . the natural leather is lovely , but scuffs easily . i strongly recommend buffing with neutral polish or saddle soap/oil to give it a bit of durability . highly recommended , even for wider feet !
apparel	the shoes are comfortable . easy to wear and feel great with or without socks !
apparel	these boots look good with jeans . can be loose , but comfortable with thick socks
apparel	i 'm very satisfied with this purchase . the jeans are great quality for the price . however , it was not stated that they would be the ( very ) long length that they were . i had to alter them , which was an inconvenience
apparel	i am a bit disappointed in the quality . it looked like a possible reject off the factory line . there are threads uncut and the velcro was sewed wrong in one of the side pockets . you really should not expect too much . you may find something better quality in some of your local cheap department store chain .
apparel	originally ordered a completely different model armband for 15 bux . got this one ... ... we 'll see if my 80 gb video will fit ... ..doubt it ... .amazon ... .bad call on this seller son ! ! !
apparel	these were ordered for my son for regular sledding and tubing activities . he thinks they are warm and comfortable - not stiff like similar snow pants from other manufacturers . they are a great value
apparel	disappointing . i wear size 37 birkenstocks and these are one half inch shorter than my other clogs
apparel	nice shirt . well made . good price . what more can i say
apparel	i have a small head and it makes it look huge ! maybe if i had a big head it would look alright pfff
apparel	i bought some of these - i find they have a large seam on the right side which digs into my skin and is quite uncomfortable . other than that they are ok , but because of this i mostly wear these inside out
apparel	this backpack is sturdy , good looking , very functional and at at least a third of the price of other similar backpacks i looked at , i 'm completely satisfied with this purchase
apparel	very happy with this product . they are substantial so they are `` suitable '' for a medium or large and not someone who is small . delivery was fast and it was well packed . shipping was included , though i did n't realize it until the end of the ordering process .
apparel	this shoe is great . it even came with an extra pair of shoe strings that had a different design . the only thing that i felt it lacked was extra comfort . i wear skechers and have done so for years and i have had other styles that were more comfortable although this was not top comfort it was definitely wearable and did not hurt my feet . it was a great deal that i just could n't pass up and definitely worth the price :
apparel	the sweater i received was extremely thin : i had expected something more like an ll bean cardigan , which i dearly love . i was wrong . what do i do now ? roger hampton ( 503 ) 293-5655 ov10abronco @ juno.com
apparel	i actually had to send this back cause of the size . they run really small .
apparel	i ordered a large and assumed it was adult size ... this large was like a girls size large ... .very small sizing i returned the sweater..
apparel	i was impressed by the look of this bag . it really looked like it would seal the contents well . unfortunately , it did not . i tried several times , and each time , the contents of the bag were soaked ! fortunately i tested it out with just some cash for a day at the pool ... and only ended up with soggy money . if i had put my cell phone and watch in the bag , they would have been ruined . i do n't recommend it
apparel	i actually purchased a 9.5 and felt they were a little too big and then ordered a size 9 . the 9 did n't fit well the arch was too short , so i sent them back and kept the 9.5 . they are very nice , i 've been looking for a nice pair of boots for 5 years . i get a lot of compliments , from people of all ages ( 20-65 ) . not too young looking , not too old looking . they are the perfect boot . one little negative ... .i needed to put in a pad for the front part of my foot - not a lot of cushion . after that i can wear them all day long . i should have ordered them in brown ! !
apparel	: ( these will give you pain . i bought these shoes because they looked rather cute in the picture , and considering they were n't just a $ 5 pair of shoes , i thought they would be somewhat comfortable , if not doable , to wear . buyer beware : these shoes will cut your heels . they run a little small , so i suggest getting at least a half size larger . if you want to do anything besides sitting and looking pretty , do not buy these shoes . i walked for less than 2 minutes before they started tearing and blistering my heels . they also are a little tight on the toes , so if you have a wide foot , these definitely are not for you . i have to admit , they are darling and cute , but they are not worth the pain .
apparel	initially i was going to order several items from andrew christian , until i saw their shipping prices at checkout . $ 2 shipping on each $ 4 tee-shirt was more than excessive , they were going to charge me $ 20 shipping on a $ 42 order ! i canceled most of the items , only ordering a belt and a tee . shipping was still ~ 50 % surcharge . received my order yesterday and found that the belt is defective . the buckle is on backwards ( no , it 's not reversible ... ) plus the material of the belt itself is damaged by a frayed hole . it is n't worth the shipping cost hassle to send it back , i 'll probably just throw it away - but i did learn something . i will never deal with andrew christian again ! i you choose to , please pay attention to the shipping charges when you check out - you may decide to revise your order
apparel	i just received this bag today and i am absolutely in love with it.this bag looks alot more expensive then it is and the inside is huge ! ! ! with a zip pocket and additional large pocket and smaller one that is perfect for my mp3 player . my husband got it 100 % right with this little surprise . so if you enjoy a large bag that looks great on your arm this one is it expecially for the price ! ! !
apparel	this shoe is n't as comfortable as my other keds shoes . it also does n't breath as well . if you have a tendency to develope hot feet , this would n't be a good purchase for you . it also needs the new insoles that the newer keds shoes have
apparel	i am solidly a size medium , but i was swimming in this jacket . i think it is more of an xl . i 'd say the medium is for someone 5'10 '' and 250lbs
apparel	the wallet was a gift for my daughter 's boyfriend . he loved the wallet , the leather , the design , style , and sleek look of the fossil wallet . it was a great purchase and a good value
apparel	comfortable . if elastic waist degrades over time ( not known yet , but has happened to other pajamas ) , there is no back-up draw-string . as with all flannel pjs , easily tangles with flannel sheets
apparel	for the price , this product should receive the cruciatus curse ad infinitum . the material is all synthetic ( i was expecting a wool blend , though the ad said nothing about what the hat and scarf were made of ) , the relatively loose weave means it will not last as long , and one of the tassels fell off the scarf after just one wearing . i dislike being taken advantage of just so i can make my daughter happy . she is disappointed as well . it was a lot of money to pay to get the hogwarts crest on a patch that was n't even fully embroidered . j.k. rowling should be upset that english woolens , with which this product will be associated by people who are not in the know , will acquire such a poor image because of the greed of the licensing people
apparel	my husband loves this coat . he wears it all winter . if you are someone that doesnt like a bulky exceptionally warm lined coat this is it . he is uncomfortable in something like down because it is too sweaty but this is perfect . warm enough and lightweight and comfortable . this is the second one he has purchased .
apparel	i could not believe the quality in these shoes ... horrible ! the material feels and sounds like cardboard or paper . they have an awful smell and are uncomfortable . i bought chinese shoes in china town for $ 2 , they were wonderfully comfortable , still smelled funny , but they were awesome.these are not !
apparel	i purchased this robe for my boyfriend as a christmas gift ... and i wish i would have purchased one for myself as well ! this robe is made of the softest , warmest materials , but is extremely light-weight , unlike most robes . `` luxurious '' is the perfect adjective .
apparel	they are perfect for kids daily lunches . would like to order more but do n't where to start . lost all the ordering information
apparel	the pants are not juniors ' , they are women 's pants that go up past your waistline when you wear them
apparel	they were not as heavy weight as stated..to me they seem more like a regular t-shirt..and the size seems to be a little smaller than norm..after first washing , they really shrink.. i will not buy any more .
apparel	i purchased the white entrance wedge sandal by steve madden from amaon.com and i love them ! they are so cute and they go with everything ! perfect fun shoe for the beach , or for a night out ! people compliment me when i wear them and you will not be dissapointed ! they are so comfortable and did i say that i love them ! :
apparel	sorry , there is no way this shirt is supposed to last even your first five months ... runs too small and was completely to thin/sheer . can be seen straight through
apparel	this listing ise n't correct . item nts1 is a nylon tank top shirt , not a t-shirt
apparel	i wear this shirt waiting tables and i reccomend it to anyone . when washed it is wrinkle free and can survive many washings . the larger size is very roomy and sleeve length is appropriate for long arms . i only wish it came in a broad collar instead of just a point color , but still an excellent shirt
apparel	i could not find these slippers in our local stores . i had two pair that were worn out and wanted exactly the same item . i ordered them , they arrived and i love them . it was a very easy , customer friendly process
apparel	shirts are what i had expected and the service was grea
apparel	good construction and material for the price . size seems a bit different in l vs. r unless i am more asymmetrical now than i noticed before ? nice sheepskin material . i am hoping this lasts longer than the previous moc i purchased by acorn
apparel	i purchased these about 3 months ago . they have very little arch support and very little other support elsewhere . i have been wearing them perhaps 2-3 times a week to the office and home . they are already ripping in the back . i would n't recommend them ; however , i do get many compliments about how cute they are .
apparel	i still love this bra ! it 's great for casual wear , sleeping etc . it does solve the back fat problem , however there is no lift and separate for me . i 'm going to try the underwire version of this bra to see if it helps . it is an extremely comfortable bra that feels great on ! i bought a l for the band size , but there 's just not quite enough coverage for my ds
apparel	i have started water walking in the fitness center pool and found i was slipping enough to bother me . this shoe fits like a glove and is very inexpensive to use . i would recommend it to anyone desiring to use it for this purpose or any other water related activity . i am certain it would be great at the beach , etc
apparel	this strap is thinner than those used in yoga classes . it is sharp on the arch when held there for poses . i would not purchase another one .
apparel	these sunglasses are all right . they were a little crooked , but still cool..
apparel	love it ... love it ... love it ! ! ! every football fan should have one . it is perfect for tailgating . this is the only site i could find it . great price and the free shipping is a great deal . it also shipped really fast , faster then it had originally said .
apparel	the shoes were n't the color that i wanted them to be . to me , there cheap and are over priced ! the quality is not good . they can easily be scuffed . am definitely returning them ! !
apparel	i will be returning this item to the vendor . i rec 'd . this skirt for my daughter and thought it had a colorful embroidery . instead i find the word baske in a mirrored embroidered image . not sure what baske stands for . i guess it 's their idea of 'short for basketball ' . whatever ! you ca n't see the pic clearly . i 'm out the shipping cost on this one . what a bummer !
apparel	so glad i did n't have to choose between the convenience of carrying all my cards and the bulkyness of a holder big enough to accommodate them . this wallet is slimline and holds all my cards . it 's been 6 months since i wrote this review , and i only become more satisfied with this wallet . all my cards are easily accessed , viewed and i know immediately if one is missing . the leather is silky soft and durable . people have been asking where i found this item . i think it 's the best i 've ever purchased
apparel	sorry to give such a bad review but i ca n't in good conscience give a better one . i did this workout one time with the 8 lb . ball and have not been able to do any kind of exercise since . i am entering my second week of taking pain killers for my messed-up lower back . there are several segments ( including ab work ) where the ball is held with straight arms and moved from the down position to up over the head as well as twisting side-to-side . while doing these moves , i kept thinking that they really did not seem sound for that much weight . sure enough by that evening i was dying ! perhaps they 'd be ok if you used the lightest weight ball . i am in good shape and have actually been doing the p90x extreme workouts . i am accustomed to using 20-40 lb . weights and do tae kwon do and i do not have any back problems . i snatched this up when i finally found it for a good price and did it on an off day . just be forewarned-it is really easy to hurt your back with this workout . i love all the other firm workouts but will never do this one again . additionally , when i received this from amazon the ball was misshapen the dvd case was broken from the weight of the ball . they immediately sent a replacement which was damaged in exactly the same way
apparel	i did not expect the jockey to not show any lines but there was absolutely no difference between these and a regular pair of bikini . these should be renamed jockey show-everything bikini
apparel	i purchased this case after getting tired of waiting for creatives leather case to become available . as far as appearance , it is well crafted . when it comes to functinality , it stinks . here are the problems i have with it : 1 ) there is no hole for the microphone , 2 ) the hole for the headphone jack is not lined up properly , 3 ) the charger and sync adapter brick ca n't fully engage the player because of the leather straps , so it is easily disengaged by the slightest movement . this is ok at home , but try using this in the car ( if you want to charge while you listen ) ; it falls out with every turn you make . this case was not designed with much thought about the functions of the zen player
apparel	the sneakers are great . my son loves the wheels on the side
apparel	i purchasese the red ones , and i love them . they really go well with many different colors . i was really pleasantly surprised
apparel	i 'm a pretty sexy girl and these so called panties are just about too sexy for me . ooooweee do i feel hot when i have 'em on . levi 's , shorts , dress or trucker 's overhauls , it makes no difference . the whole rest of the world might not know what you have on under there , but you 'll know and that 's enough to add a certain blush to your face , let me tell you . they made me feel ready for bed all day long
apparel	i bought this sweatshirt last year and it is one of the most comfortable articles of clothing i own . i am a little ashamed to admit that i do n't use it when exercising , its so comfortable i use it to lounge around the house .
apparel	i ordered the 50 's style rockabilly polka dot dress in a 1x . i am a full sized woman with a small waist and a well endowed chest . the cup size for the 1x looked to be about a c cup at the most . i sent back the 1x for the 3x in which the cupsize looked to be a d , the dress has no support what so ever in the chest area so a bra is a must for heavier chested women . the waist and back area was way too large in the 3x . i was not only displeased with the fit but the quality of the material is poor as well . the dots are screenprinted on so after a few washes they will begin to crack and fade , it does say handwash ( but even still some of the dots are already lighter than others ) . i 'm giving the dress two stars because the style of the dress is really nice and if you can get it to fit the right way its not a bad price at all , but it 's definitely not a dress that your going to have around for a long time .
apparel	i got two pairs of these for my kids and they could hardly walk after wearing these . unless the bottom of your feet are tough i would not get these
apparel	beware : this bra will increase the appearance of your breasts a full cup size or more ! the only draw back to acquiring this bra is slyly wearing it without family and co-workers knowing something 's up . this bra is made from good materials . the cups are thick and smooth and the straps are study and comfortable . the liquid is ample but not noisy or lumpy . the cup fabric is itchy at first , but a handwash in woolite will fix that . the only problem i have , is that this bra does n't push the breasts up to the cup ! i prefer low-cut blouses and would feel more confident in a `` push-up '' design . otherwise , it 's a truly effective bra to give you non-surgical results
apparel	i had the worst feet ! i ran my first marathon in may , and i was in a panic . on my long runs in march and the first part of april i was going to quit ! my feet hurt so bad ! i was training on a lot of downhill runs , and therefore landed on the balls of my feet . ouch ! i think i would have been better off to run in nothing , than to wear what i had , which was a top of the line shoe . i was desparate ! i found these asics gt 2110 men 's shoe ( i 'm a woman ) and i felt 100 % better ! ! i had support plus the cushion i needed for my sore feet , what an awesome shoe ! ! i finished my marathon in them , i could n't have done it without them .
apparel	if your name were johnny damon , maybe . but you 're bagging groceries at the star market for $ 7.25/hour . is this jersey really worth a day 's pay to you ? the chicks are n't gon na be fooled into thinking you 're on the team . the sox wo n't vote you a world series share . your mom 's gon na throw it in the dryer and shrink the beejesus out of it , and you 're gon na wish you had that money back when your buddy tommy is selling his old malibu .
apparel	i purchased this dress to be the maid of honor in my best friends wedding . it arrived quickly , looked great , and was an awesome price . it would be hard to beat this great deal
apparel	these are very pretty without too much fluff . the leather bottoms are padded which helps your feet especially if your home is on concrete slab . i love them
apparel	this is the standard style from the new line of performance jocks from bike . this waistband is slightly smaller than the traditional 3 inch , but very comfortable . the pouch fits nice and snug giving you perfect support and the leg straps do n't twist or bind . easy to launder and pretty inexpensive . i got rid of my old worn-out jocks and bought a few of these new ones . they 're masculine , modern and comfortable , but not something that would be embarassing putting on or taking off at the gym ( like an orange or blue jock ) . a good buy . comes in a black version , that is also great . i 've worn for working out , and just around town - good for both .
apparel	since these jeans were ordered as a gift for someonelse , i can not give my own opinion of the jeans , other than to say i received the jeans in a timely manner and that the size and color was exactly what i had ordered
apparel	this is the first time i 've ordered shoes without trying them on , but these shoes were exactly what i was looking for and could n't find in the department stores in my size . i know the name naturalizer so knew they would be good quality . they fit perfect , and the price was right ! thank you amazon
apparel	this is a really comfortable , and it 's very protective , especially in high winds . it keeps you war , and it looks good , i personally added new patches to my jacket , its looks really good ! ! ! this is a good buy ! ! you should get this jacket
apparel	these are the most warm and comfortable slippers . i would recommend these to everyone
apparel	i 'd been shopping for a pair of running shoes and have tried on various brands . these shoes surpassed others in fit , support , and comfort . i 'm so glad kayano comes in wide sizes , because it fits my feet perfectly ! i highly recommend !
apparel	the nine west botamy boots are comfortable and really well made . the leather is very soft also . even though the toe is very pointed , these boots are still comfortable . amazon has a great price on these boots
apparel	even though i favor leather , every once in a while a pleather product comes along that i really appreciate . well , these boots sadly are not in that category . the pleather started cracking after i wore the boots x3 ; the lining was poorly cut to begin with and started unraveling . the sad part is that for the amount of money that i spend on these boots , i could have bought a pair of leather ones after x-mas
apparel	got these slippers for my man for christmas . they are buttery soft , the fit is true to size and they are not lined with something to heavy and hot for the feet . can be worn barefoot or with socks . great for a quick dash outside . i would recommend these slippers and this seller
apparel	the crib sheets were soft , the service fast and they fit the pack and play mattress
apparel	i was disappointed with the shoes when i received them . on the website , the shoes looked gold in color and were described as gold , but when i received the shoes they were beige . i am sorry to say that i could not wear the shoes .
apparel	my daughter simply loves this item . very handy , compact , and versatile . a great wonderful gift for anyone 's daughter .
apparel	i love these shoes , they are totally cute . the only draw back is they are kinda like satin over paper . they are n't as soft as i thought they would be , but i great buy none the less .
apparel	girlfriend loves these gloves , they were thicker than her original fingerless globes , however she complained about the thumbs . she wish they had a better way to hold them on the thumb , and when not in use to restrain it back
apparel	i bought this for me , but the size ran small and it is not of a very good weight . i have a daughter that they did fit and she wanted to wear them under things so she became the proud owner . the shirts are not by any means high or even good quality
apparel	i ordered 2 wristlets - a brown and a leopard print . i was sent two brown wristlets , the return process was difficult , and when i returned the product i did not receive a refund or the correct product ! !
apparel	my first pregnancy i tried several styles of belts , most of which had a wide band in back . i am short , have a short midriff , and am overweight , so wider belts would roll from the top down . i never had that problem with this belt . unfortunately , this pregnancy i am entering my 3rd trimester and have finally out grown the 1x belt , and the store i purchased it from is now closed . i was thrilled when i found this on amazon.com in a larger size . i recommend making it little snug in the mornings and then loosening it throughout the day as needed . the most appealing feature for me is that this band is completely adjustable to give you the support you need for the different activities you will be doing throughout the day . any time you start needing the extra support , just slightly tighten the side straps . when you start relaxing or if the belt starts feeling a little tight , just loosen it up a bit . it 's quick and easy to work with , and if one side needs more support than the other , just make that one side a bit more snug . it 's awesome ! i am a technology education specialist , so i 'm on my feet for , many times , 16 hrs a day training and supporting hospitals with their new computer programs . i could n't have survived even my first trimester without this belt . i raise it a little higher in the back so that i have complete lower back support and belly support . there were days when i forgot to wear my belt that i almost could n't walk after only 4 hrs of work due to lower back pain that would eventually extend down to my fanny and legs . my legs would litterally give out from underneath me until i could rub and relax my lower back for a while . when you are working with doctors in the surgery room or doing rounds with them this is not a good thing . as long as i wore my belt , i never had a problem . i strongly recommend this product
apparel	not comfortable . the `` thong '' between your toes is too thick and too tight . if you are looking for toeless , this is not the way to go . try dkny hosiery instead . expensive , but worth it for the comfort factor and they are very durable
apparel	horrible . must go through hell to return it too , they wo n't give you back the shipping to send it to you , just the cost of the item . do not buy . do not recommend
apparel	they were not as heavy weight as stated..to me they seem more like a regular t-shirt..and the size seems to be a little smaller than norm..after first washing , they really shrink.. i will not buy any more .
apparel	my son loved these jeans . the jeans were very comfortable . the best thing about them was that because my son is so thin the elastic adjustments were perfect
apparel	this bra is definately not for the over b cup set . the openings are too big and you 'd be better off wearing nothin
apparel	with the sale and promotional rate applied . this is a great shoe
apparel	this bag is perfect as a commuter bag on my bike . the cell phone pocket is very accessible and the bag is large enough to hold a change of clothes , but not so large everything gets lost inside
apparel	i really liked my tote bag . what i liked most was the variety of colors and the size of the bag which is pretty durable considering that i use mine to tote my books in college . the only thing that i didnt like was the outrageous amount for shipping . let me tell you when i say the company sent the bag `` stuffed '' in a small manilla envelope but yet charged me what almost 6 or 7 dollars in shipping when in fact the enevelope probably costed about 50 cents to ship . that was foul ! despite everything about the shipping cost the bag is a good bag and i guess i shouldnt complain as much
apparel	these are stylish and nice and perfect to wear under a pair of cutoff levi 's . my cutoffs are so faded , so frayed , so , well you know . so when i peal them off to reveal this butterfly lace up panty ( in black with the pick laces on the back ) it 's like an instant transformation from outdoor girl to bedroom girl . we only had two colors at our lingerie party , white and the black and pink models , but i can imagine all the colors would be nice too .
apparel	if your loved one is a beautiful 5'7 '' , 130 lb slender lady like mine , forget about this piece of clothing . if , however , she is a 5'1 '' 180 lb gorgeous `` petite '' girl , this might just be the excitement inducer you are looking for . you 'll have lots of fun , first trying to put it on her , then trying to use the slits which are in all the wrong places , and then finally to remove it from her body without injuring her or yourself . fun that will come after that is purely optional..
apparel	this is a fabulous find ! my husband loves henley shirts ... but , they have to be just the right fabric weight and sleeve length . after many failed attempts , i finally found the perfect shirt . great look , great feel and most importantly my husband likes it too
apparel	i am totally satisfied with the merchant and the product
apparel	let me assure anyone who is even remotely thinking of buying these shoes ... ... ... .do it ! they are not only beautiful but as high as they are , they are extremely comfortable . the detail is way more beautiful in person as they are on the website . my favorite shoe of the summer
apparel	these are very good quality slippers , comfortable well worth the price .
apparel	purchased this for my girlfriend . told me that fits well and was very happy with this . i am glad to get such a good price on them too
apparel	very comfortable - looks great - makes it easy to move around in bed
apparel	shoe is comfortable but the description says off white or white with beige . which leads you to think the color is mostly white . the true color is neither ! there is absolutely no white in these shoes . i purchased these shoes because i needed some white off/white shoes not beige shoes . no i did not return them it 's too much of a hassel to return things so i kept them and i have worn them once but do not like the color at all . the style is not as cute as her others but they are still a great bargain . the materials are an excellent quality . if you like beige earthtones you will like these shoes
apparel	backpack is light when empty , yet strong to curry the load of books to school . side pocket for bottle very handy . top pocket for cd player or small easy to reach items such as keys , very helpful and practical . i like the base of the backpack being dark color so it does n't look dirty from use
apparel	these pants have a tendency to split horizontally for almost no reason at all . if they split alont the seam that would be one thing but to ctross a seam and just practically explode even when they fit loosely can only mean rotten fabric and that is what you will get when you buy these . i have lost the 3 pairs i biught to the self same calamity and always in public . please save yourself the trouble . by the way the lee version of these pants also do the same thing . be afraid be very afraid .
apparel	do not waste you money on this piece of sh** case not only it is loose it ; s bad quality i just got it two days ago and the arm band came apart , and i have no idea what this white thing is that it comes with it is useless . what a waste of money .
apparel	the quality of this product can not in any way compare to the genuine apple ipod covers . it is very flimsy , does not fit correctly , does not come with a belt clip and most importantly leaves the display area wide open to scratches and breakage . that 's right ; there is no plastic or glass protection for the display area . there is a reason why this product does not cost as much as other ipod covers . that 's because it is of poor quality . also , when you calculate the cost of the cover , plus the cost of shipping it , you do not get a bargin . as a matter of fact , if someone gave me this product for free , i would not accept it because , like i stated earlier , it provides no protection .
apparel	like the last reviewer said it 's tricky to put on using the little straps that go around your bra ... that is a fact . a front closure bra might help some . even though i ( finally and after a lot of cussing ) got the straps around my bra , the garment still gapped underneath the bra on both sides of the back strap , which is right in the middle . that is the only place in the back there is a strap to hold the whole back of the girdle up . then there is one strap under each arm that goes around your bra there . it pulled down on my bra there causing scrunching . there is one strap in front in the middle too , which i do n't need to use . the directions say to attach the spanx/straps to the bra and 'step ' into the garment . right ! ! much easier said than done . for it to stay up properly in the back i think it needs straps not only right in the middle , but also to the left and right of the middle , in between that and the under the arm ones . i ca n't really use mine ... a waste of money , i already removed the tags and ca n't send it back . i have another spanx that is the same but without the little straps and i ca n't use that either , as it does creep down in the back . unless you do n't move that is . so altogether i have spent about $ 150 for spanx stuff i ca n't use . there must be a better way to fasten those straps ... .maybe sturdy snaps or velcro or something , and they should fasten right to the top edge of the garment , as it is they hook half an inch down on the inside and that causes the top edge to tend to roll out and cause bulk there . not happy
apparel	these shoes are so cute and sexy ! high heels makes a girl look so much longer and leaner ! beware though , if you 've never bought naughtys i would go to a store and try them on first b4 buying online . i wear 8 's in everything but these , i wear 7.5 . love them !
apparel	classic wedding tuxedo . excellent fabric and cut . the tuxedo was changed to single breasted suit after my approval .
apparel	the boots arrived packaged in their original packaging and individually wrapped inside . these boots will never disappoint ... they are fun , warm , comfy and stylish ! dont forget to spray with silicon before taking them out
apparel	i just love different and odd things . i love to give people gifts that no one else have.thanks
apparel	this is a nice case if you are looking for something compact . i have a kodak easy share digital camera and it fits perfect inside . the case has a nice size front pouch and 2 side pouches for easy storage
apparel	it 's awful . the s size is too big for me ( my waistline is 34 and in the sizing chart it says `` size s fits 26-36 '' ) so i end up cut it and sew it back so it can fit on me . then after 3 days of wearing it , the velcro is messed up , it can not attached together anymore . the costumer service is an answering machine ( i tried several times to call the costumer service , and only get the machine answer my call ) . i can not return the item , because it says its illegal to return this kind of item . so my advise , dont buy this item or you 'll be sorry .
apparel	seriously , went into the store to find new running shoes , possibly the air 360 . was wearing shoxs in the store . threw them away immediately . these are the best shoes i 've worn in a long while . i 'm one of those ppl that like to take off my shoes as soon as i get home . i forgot that these were on , they were that comfortable . i 'm a heavy , parttime runner . nothing over 5k as i am just starting again . they support my weight extremely well
apparel	these shoes are so light that sometimes i forget i have them on . they are so comfortable than i do n't want to take them off . i have to walk a lot every day and i am not kidding when i said that any other pair of shoes make my feet sore after a few hours of use , but these shoes do the job to perfection . i highly recommend them
apparel	i really wanted this product to work , but it really did n't help with my problem . i always have erect nipples no matter what and this really does n't fully flatten them , or make them less noticeable with t-shirts , etc
apparel	i bought this hat for my 4 year old granddaughter for christmas . she loved it . the downside : the elastic stretch band on the inside of the hat was so tight that the hat would not sit on her head without popping off . we would have returned it but it was christmas morning and my granddaughter was thrilled with the concept of having a cowgirl hat . we ultimately solved the problem by cutting out the elastic band and the hat now fits just fine ! i guess the elastic band is supposed to make the hat fit various sized heads but it is beyond me how the hat would stay on anyone 's head
apparel	dilvered quickly in time for christmas . sweatshirt was great quality
apparel	this is saled as a baseball shoes but it is for american footbal . but the mistake goes more long , because the photo included shows a baseball shoes how you can observ in the marks of the sole
apparel	the webbing was abundant and easy to cut to my needed length . these belts can be made to fit anyone
apparel	this device didnt work properly at all , i lost my money on this purchase.sorry , but that 's how i feel
apparel	i got these for christmas in 06 and they looked great on me . last week i took them to school and i put them in the small pouch of my backpack and at then at the end of the day i took them out at on of the sides had completley snaped in half.there was no way to repair them . these glasses look good but dont waste your money on these . really cheap . i am very unhappy . = (
apparel	i was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the items i ordered -- as well as receiving a 10 % discount coupon for my next order . thanks
apparel	the earmuffs are very nice quality and the color was perfect for my daughter
apparel	we received this product in a clear plastic molded container , however there were no instructions at all , nor was there any label . we immediately thought , this must not be a new product . not knowing exactly how to attach it to the psp or detach it , one of the clips has broken . we also have more questions - can the battery inside this charger be replaced ? if so , what kind is it ? i think we 'll be returning this product
apparel	i agree . cup had too much left at the end and all i can say is pointy
apparel	the boots were not what i expected . the pictures made the books look different then they actually were . they were exremely wide and the sizing was off .
apparel	i was getting some boning too but didnt mind . this ensemble is a lot of fun to wear once its broken in . i wear mine all the time
apparel	i bought this for my husband . we tried it in one car and it kept getting stuck in the lighter socket and the end kept coming off ( it was n't screwed very tightly and could n't be screwed tighter ) . in the other car it fit in the socket all right but every couple of minutes you had to adjust the radio station and even then the music came through fuzzy . also , if you turned the car off it does n't remember which station it was tuned to . we are going to return it to amazon , but i 'm not sure how as i do n't think they have an option for returning it as 'the product just is n't very good ! ' if you want something cheap and are ok with it not being particularly reliable then this is for you , but for hardcore music lovers , i suggest savinf up and investing in a better product .
apparel	ordered a pair ... and they lost my first order . had to contact amazon to help . finally got order..and pants were too small . so..had to re order larger size . got pants in same size as last . wrote back saying i know have two pair of pants that are too small . first they denied sending wrong size..then later wrote back saying they did make a mistate and that new order in correct size was on its way with postage lables to send pants back . well a month later still have not recieved pants or lables . have wrote half a dozen emails asking for a reply and help..no reply . never had such poor customer service
apparel	reliable brand of work pants in a good selection of colors is all we 're asking for
apparel	we were disappointed when we received this because it showed up in a search with silk robes and pajamas and i guess i assumed tht it was silk . rather stiff and uncomfortable
apparel	men here is a tip . if you want to please your lady , use a sexy thong instead . we love how a man looks in a thong
apparel	the robe does not fit me . i wanted to return it , got a return item number , got busy , and did not get it in the mail soon enough . they have a strict 30 day return ploicy . nordstroms does not do this . i could exchange it there . sorry i got a job and not time for petty rules . i will go elsewhere next time
apparel	thank you for this great gift for a baby shower states away that you made helpful and she loves i
apparel	the shirt is of ok quality but the design is hard to see and will probaby wash off quickly . be sure to order a size bigger than you normally would as it is cut small . also my personal opinion is the shipping charge for this very light item is a little excessive
apparel	i have been using this for awhile now . unlike some sports bras that are this supportive , it 's a lighter weight material/construction . i would n't say that there probably is n't something better out there and it is n't cheap - but it 's not bad . for my peers that have this 'issue ' , you know what i 'm talking about ! :
apparel	my wife had one just like this for 15 years and it was time for a new one . this back is almost identical and better quality . shipping was very fast and it came exactly as i expected
apparel	i bought a sweatshirt from them -- the tote was a `` freebie '' and too small for much use anyway . customer service was awful . they sent me the wrong size -- a man 's size , not the woman 's i was searching for ( and the photo had a woman wearing it ! she must have been an amazon ) . i returned it the next day and they refused to accept the return , saying it looked worn
apparel	i bought these slippers for my mother , who is 5 years post stroke . she has difficulty keeping shoes and slippers on because she has no feeling in her left foot since her stroke . also she is always cold even when it is 80+ degrees outside . these slippers have been wonderful . they fit her well , they stay on and they keep her feet warm . when she wears these out will definitly by another pair
apparel	for years , i wore asics . the gt , the cumulus , the nimbus . but i have to say , if you 're fan of any asics shoes named after clouds , you should try the trigon 4 . very similar , but cheaper . also they did not joke when they called it the ride . it has a very smooth transition and insane cushion , but a little more support than asics for those who are neutral gait yet a tad wanting in stabilization without all the weight . a big thumbs ( toes ? ) up
apparel	i searched the internet for a particular type of sock that my son likes , but discovered they were no longer manufactured . so i went to amazon to see what they offered and decided to try the gold toe . the price was excellent and my son likes them very much . ( he 's very finicky about some things and it was a real `` if '' to try something new ) ... i 'm so happy that amazon offered them and at a price that meant it would not be a huge loss if they did n't work out . my son has looked at the price of this sock at some of the department stores nearby discovered that the amazon price is very good ; so now we know where to go when he needs some more . thank you , amazon
apparel	i washed this garment according to the recommendation and it shrank about 2 sizes . . . to the point i can no longer wear it . bummer after just wearing it once
apparel	at first glance , you 'll think these are great - but the wimpy elastic combined with the slippery fabric makes for panties that are constantly sliding off your butt .
apparel	my mouth dropped when i received this item . the inside is like raw material and the piece that holds the money down is not easy to use . for clarity it has 2 outside pockets and no inside pockets
apparel	good bag , i thought it was a little bigger , but it worked out great
apparel	i was givin this case for christmas and i thought it was great for the first month ... ... ... ... ... ... .then i took it off to get some dust off the screen and my screen was totally scratched and it also scratched the space above the click wheel and below the screen . i am a total scratch freak but still i was really mad . warning : if you do n't like your ipod scratched do not get this case ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
apparel	very satisfied with my purchase . the item was a christmas present for my son and they got here in plenty of time and fit perfect . amazon was the only place i could find the shoes in stock and the price was also lower than any other site
apparel	i bought this for a woman who is a small size eight , one of those people who is just a touch too big to wear a size six , and normal medium sized clothes usually run very loose . not this tiny shirt . it looked all right when she opened the package , but when she wore it , it made the kid look as if she had flub . it was inexpensive enough that i wo n't bother returning it , but the item , although well made , was sized so small as to be useles
apparel	i love my birkenstock shoes . they fill great . i am a registered nurse . i am on my feet constantly all day . these shoes are great for the support my feet need . they are really comfortable . i will definately be purchasing more in the near future .
apparel	so i ordered this shirt and i got an entirely diffent one , the packing slip had the right order # . the shirt i received was long sleeved , crew neck with a notch in it . ans when i called them , the person i spoke to was not the least bit shocked/ amazed or even willing to send the right one , she just said send it back ... think twice unless you do n't mind making trips to the post offic
apparel	it 's just what i wanted . i pulled out the removable sections because i prefer a slimmer feel .
apparel	i am very pleased with the terry wrap that i bought as a christmas gift . i had looked in every store i was in while christmas shopping for one but found none so was very pleased to find this one . it is well made , looks good and the price was great . shipping was very quick without paying extra for express service
apparel	okay , this cap is really stylish . but i think the sewing is n't quite finished . there were loose threads all over my caps when i got them . not to mention the parts that were n't even sewed ... no threads at all
apparel	i bought this for christmas and i receive it with a large scratch rite on the hard screen where the screen is . i email back to see if they could do something and they never answer back . very rude
apparel	i ended up giving away these shoes after wearing them one day . we have a recycle area in our apartment building , but it is usually used for things that are not brand new ! these shoes hurt my feet and had no cushioning at all against the concrete i walk on . i will not buy another pair of shoes on line again , unless i know the make and size from hands on purchase before
apparel	i purchased these for my fiance to wear for our beach wedding in puerto rico . the quality is horrendous , the cut is for mc hammer not real men , and the company charged me over $ 22.00 to ship them to me and then told me i wanted them fed ex . not true , the pants were returned , the rest of my order cancelled and i will never purchase anything from this company again
apparel	i realize this is n't an expensive bra , but i expected it to at least fit ! i 've never ordered a bra that was sized this crazy ! the band was way too big and the cups were way too small . needless to say i 'm returning it . save your money , ladies ! on top of that , it took almost a month to receive it because it was out of stock . even though figleaves displayed the item as in stock . this is the third time figleaves has done this for amazon items . i think i 'll skip buying from them in the future
apparel	can you say p a i n ? this is what steve madden shoes are . pain . the soles must be made of cast iron . the upper materials must be made of the roughest of rope or some material meant to be deliberately scratchy and rough . i am convinced that this madden person hates women . if it were in my power , i would track down steve madden and force said person to wear their own shoe designs , only standing , walking and ... ..dancing even until they committed to making shoes that are fit for human beings to wear without any pain .
apparel	not very good pictures or description.wallet was smaller than i expected.quality was ok , not competitively priced
apparel	these shoes are adorable and perfect for summer ! ! i love mine ! ! the only negative thing is that they are wide . i have normal size feet and ordered my regular shoe size . they fit length wise but are very spacey width wise
apparel	good material and does the job that it promises ! ! all other brands claim to do the same thing but `` not all glitters are gold '' :
apparel	i got both my sons these socks and really liked the performance , thickness , etc . however , it has been only two months and several of my three year olds ' socks now have holes in the toes , the heels , and you can see the fabric wearing thin and about to have holes at other places . my 8 month olds ' socks are fine , however , he does n't give them the wear of a three year old . so if you have a baby , these socks are great ! if you have a preschooler , very poor choice
camera	this gadget is a must-have for gadget lovers ... ..and picture lovers . it is compact , solid and fits any small pocket or clutch bag . the images are crisp if you get it set appropriately . if you love attention get this product and if you do n't ... ..not to worry the camera gets all of it .
camera	well , besides a whole bucket full of money , one of them lets you take photos in lower light , okay , that 's obvious . the 16-35mm is a bit heavier , but not so you 'd notice , unless maybe you were carrying it around all day , without eating and you 're a bit over the hill . so why pay the extra money , unless , of course , you do a lot of shooting in the early morning and late evening ? maybe you should n't , because i 've been doing a lot of photo taking with both , film and digital , and as one would expect from the `` l '' lenses , the photos are crisp and sharp . in fact i keep i the 17-40 on the camera i carry around all day , you know , the one i might leave on the table in a restaurant when i got to the restroom . it 's a lot less money to lose to someone looking for a five finger discount . however , my gal pal sara and i take a lot of early morning photos . she shoots old houses , and she never , ever goes out without the 16-35mm . she swears by it , loves it , sometimes i think better than me . so there is a difference , i 'm the kind of person that could happily live with less expensive lense , sara is not . however they both deliver gorgeous photos . you ca n't go wrong if the lense has that red circle around it . jack priest , sailor home from the se
camera	at first it was a little hard to get my pictures to look as good as the samples , but i found that by re-sizing them to about an inch or so on the computer before downloading them that they show up alot better . also , the ones with higher contrast are easier to see farther away . just look at the samples that come pre-loaded to remind yourself that it is possible to get great-looking pics at a surprisingly high resolution . after a few practice downloads i was thrilled with the results . **another plus : this one came with a wall charger . most have to be plugged in to the usb to charge . the wall charger makes it perfect to share on vacation when you 're away from your computer
camera	ok ... i do n't know who reviews batteries but this one is pretty good .
camera	probably a very good case , but not a very operatable one in the field - you have to undo two closures to open the camera compartment , a strap and a velcro . the shoulder strap is not detachable - looks kind of silly when you are trying to use the belt strap . for the olympus stylus digital cameras , look to the lowepro case - better case and value
camera	i am on my third off-camera cord ( about one per year ) . two have broken . as other reviewers noted , the four screws under the metal retaining clip on the `` female '' end of the cord loosen and eventually fail . i have found that a thin narrow knife can be used to remove the black `` spring '' cover over the screws on the shoe . you can then tighten the screws with a screwdriver . if you use locktite on the screws then they will not loosen . canon should do this at the factory . i use this cord with a stroboframe `` portrait/landscape '' grip which raises the flash over the camera by six inches thus eliminating red eye and providing a much more pleasing light . the stroboframe grip comes with the right size threaded screw for this cord . when my cords failed i lost the extended-through the lens metering just like another reviewer noted . i am not a professional photographer and only use the camera occasionally yet the cord still fails . canon should re-engineer this cord to make it more durable . unfortunately , i do not believe that there are alternative cords . it looks like i will need to keep buying canon cords
camera	i purchased this camera based on previous good experience with an older model fujifilm camera , reviews here , price and functions . at the same time , i also purchased the larger xd card . almost out of the box , this camera has given me nothing but grief . what others had said about the blurry photos i can certainly echo . a month or so after purchase , the lens would not open , or it would not open totally . i first thought the batteries were dead and that was the cause ... .after changing the batteries , the problems still existed - some of the time . not always - just sporadically . just enough to cause me to miss many unique and memorable photo opportunities . in addition to that , now that i 'm looking at other brands of cameras i find the xd card i purchased is not transferable so i 'm out the cost of that as well . another malfunction of this camera is after `` erasing '' all photos on the xd card , taking more photos and uploading the new photos , i found that all the photos originally erased were still there and uploaded again with the new ones ? i do n't know if that was a camera or memory card malfunction but it just added to my dislike of this camera . i would not recommend this camera to anyone ... .it 's a total dud . i 'm very disappointed with fujifilm and am now looking at nikon and cannons . good luck fujifulm ... you need it
camera	the picture viewer is a fun way to carry lots of digital pictures in a small device . however , setting it up and loading it was a nightmare . i spent hours writing to tech support and ultimately on the phone to figure out how to move the pictures from my computer to the device
camera	i recently moved into the prosumer level of digital . the canon d30 has proven to be an awesome camera . there maybe better ( d60 ) , but if you are serious about digital , the d30 has to be one of the best cameras for the price . there is a slight lag between shots , but if you are not photographing speeding bullets and express trains , the time between shots is hardly a distraction
camera	excelent product.i get about 15 times the life of ordinary batteries . i would reccomend to anybody who uses their camera a lo
camera	i 'm a long time canon user and love the cameras but the lack of image stabilization on this one has me looking for an upgrade . i can take decent pictures but if anyone else uses this camera , the pictures are fuzzy . take a look at one of the newer canons with image stabilization and i think you 'll be happier .
camera	i 'm like most people with a digital camera . i take a bazillion pictures , develop 10 % onto paper , and then banish the other 90 % to computer storage archives . i mean , i 'd love to display a lot more of those pictures from my computer , but who has the wall space or time to organize all of those prints ? that 's why i decided to get a digital picture frame . i had been looking for quite some time , but was always turned off by the small-ish lcd sizes or poor resolutions . then i came across this coby 10 '' widescreen unit , with the 800x480 pixel display ! there were no reviews on amazon ( at the time ) , but spec-wise it had what i wanted ; a larger display and higher resolution . i took the chance and ordered one and am i glad i did ! the display is huge , and the pictures look crisp . colors are pretty accurate when compared to that of my calibrated lcd computer monitor . the interchangeable frames ( it comes with a black one as well as the white one ) make it easy to match with your décor . the litte remote is easy to use , but easy to lose as well , so make sure you place it somewhere easy to find . the built-in mp3 player is a nice touch . the speakers are n't that great ( it is a picture frame after all ) , but it 's nice to have the frame play music while in slideshow mode . there is a variety of transition effects to choose from . i have n't tried playing videos on it , so i ca n't comment on that feature . that being said , there are a few things that prevent me from giving this 5 stars . 1 . the adjustable stand is made of cheap feeling plastic . i 've seen other frames that have much nicer backs . yes , i know it 's the front you are looking at , but the stand should be sturdier , in my opinion . 2 . the angle of the stand , while adjustable , is simply held in place by friction . it actually has one setting that it can click into , but then it is angled too much to view at a normal position . 3 . there seems to be a software bug that causes the display to act weird in slideshow mode . well , to be more precise , if you are in slideshow mode and you choose either the fade , mask , or cross comb transition effects , then the very top horizontal pixel line starts to show black sections . it looks like dead pixels , but once you exit the slideshow ( or use other effects other than then ones i listed ) everything is fine . i have recreated this problem , but i do n't know if it 's just my frame or all of these . no biggie . i now use no transition effects it is perfect . 4 . this is not really a complaint about the product but more about coby 's specs . on their website they state the lcd is 800x480 . great ! so i ordered the frame and then resized a whole bunch of pictures to that resolution . however , when i got the frame and started using it , i noticed that all of my pictures had black ( blank ) bars on both the left and right sides of the picture . it turns out that the resolution is actually 860x480 ( which i found out after some trial-and-error ) . it would have been nice to know this ahead of time to save me from having to re-resize my pictures . plus , sizing pictures to 860x480 is a really weird ratio ... kinda like getting 4x7 prints . i ordered this from total electronics ( one of the amazon vendors ) and it arrived quickly . when i reported the `` dead pixel '' problem ( which turned out to be a software bug , not a defect , so to speak ) , they responded to my email quickly and offered to take it back no questions asked . now that 's customer service ! overall , i am very pleased with this product . in reality , it rates 4.5 stars . i 'm the type of person that agonizes over something before finally buying it . with this purchase , that was totally unncessary !
camera	the reviews are worthless unless the writer mentions the model of device they are using the batteries for . fifty percent of the reviews here do n't mention what they were using the batteries for . do this service justice and mention the type and model equipment for which the battereis are utilized
camera	this is an elegant leather case for the canon elph cameras . it fits in the pocket easily . i 'm satisfied
camera	nice portable background support kit . stability might be an issue but if portability is your first concern then you can overcome the stability issues with weights or caution . easy and quick to put up . i put it up by myself with very little effort . all rolls up in a nice compact bag for transporting
camera	i loved my 4.1mp sony cypershot i got for christmas in 2005 . then a few days after christmas in 2006 the screen was getting these fuzzy lines in it . if i would tap the camera they would go away . but then a few days later i was taking pictures and the camera just stopped working . it would turn on but then shut off . i had this problem before with low batteries but i changed them and it still did n't work . it would let me review pictures but not take them and now it wont turn on at all and the lens is stuck out . so many other people have had this exact problem after just one year of use . so sad camera dea
camera	easy to get up and going . we run a floral business and it allows us to take great pics for the website ! worth every penny
camera	this canon camera has poor quality interlacing artifacts all though out , on a 1080p monitor . i have used other hdv format cameras , and they were much better . the low light level recording was filled with fairly large digital grain . if you use a 1080i tube then it will probably look ok in high light , but still plauged in low light
camera	i am fascinated with this machine . it has incredible detail although it lacks a little lattitude and details are lost as soon as there are some shadows . the battery so far usually lasts me the whole day when i go touring . if i take care to shut the display down as soon as i dont need it anymore i find that when i am on a cruise ship or visiting another country i can take all the movies i usually want - - and recharge when i get back to my room at night . the only problem is playback on a tv or pc . the bundled software made by ulead is not user friendly and , whereas the previous xacti i had played back images and video clips in the order i had taken , this one separates them and plays back either clips or images . before i played back through my panasonic hard disk dvd recorder and recorded a dvd directly . now i have to go into my pc and do a whole lot of editing and so far the `` movie factory '' program keeps crashing . i imagine somebody will eventually suggest a better software program , or i will learn to use ulead , but for the time being the pictures and clips ihave taken have very good detail , and the machine has operated flawlessly .
camera	this is the worst camcorder i 've ever owned.the picture quality is the worst.i ca n't get a clear picture unless i focus at one distance.if i move a little , or something moves in the picture it goes out of focus.i have n't got one decent video with this piece of garbage yet . i recommend panasonic , it was the last camera i owned and every picture was crystal clear.it 's my fault i did n't do my research before i bought this
camera	i bought this camera for my wife and we find it unusable . the problem is the flash recovery time which takes a good 5 seconds . during this time the camera 's view finder goes black and you can not use it . because the camera is so slow , we have missed many important pictures of our children ; consequently , we found that for any important family events , this is not the camera we use . i own nikon 35mm slr cameras and i am shocked that nikon would sell this unusable product . if it is your life your recording , i recommend that you buy a different camera
camera	i only got about 2 hours of run time per charge out of this battery so i returned it for my money back and picked up a batterygeek universal dvd battery which is now giving me 7+ hours of run time per charge .
camera	i picked this up with a music order for my 350d - big mistake . the class came chipped , scratched and smuged ; tiffen filters are of very poor quality . do yourself a favor , like i did , and find your local camera supply store and pick up an optical grade filter for maybe , oh , 10 dollars more . this tiffen one was so bad that the scratches made their way onto some shots and ruined an entire day of shooting
camera	amazon sent me an email asking me to write a review of this product . usually i like to have actually used the product before writing a review , but since i have n't received it yet , that is not possible . it has been over 1 month since i ordered this with the crutchfield storefront at amazon.com . amazon 's site indicated the product was in stock , but since ordering , it has been placed on back order twice and expected to ship in a few days from now . i just wonder how it could take so long to get a product from manufacturer to end user . i do n't know where this is manufactured , or who crutchfield 's supplier is , but needless to say i am not entirely pleased with this whole process ... which does n't really have anything to do with amazon . i hear dv cable does it 's job , but i 'll have to wait and see
camera	took the camera bag on vacation and it came in very handy . i carried both my camcorder and my regular camera in the bag . it has plenty of pockets for storage and the main space inside is flexible ( has a divider you can place where ever you want ) so you can secure cameras however you wish
camera	i have used this charger battery package for a while now in my digital slr , battery performance is excellent ! the downside is that the charger has issues : the top bay charges faster than the bottom bay and the batteries get very hot when charging , it has not seemed to affect the batteries in the year i have had them . if you are looking for exceptional batteries buy these , and the charger is okay , just beware that it does not charge all nimh batteries but does do most
camera	the philips digital frame truly stands out from all other digital pictures frames that i 've gotten . the resolution and picture quality superb , and the sleek outer design is an additional plus . also , the picture frame can be charged and last a couple of hours without a cord , which is very convenient . as another reviewer said , you have to scroll through your entire collection one-by-one on your memory card in order for you to get to the picture you want . it would be more convenient if you could skip through pages or have a blackberry type rolling scroll on the side of the frame to speed through if you needed to . also , i would like to see philips next frame include a flashdrive slot as well , that way we can upload pictures from our computers to the usb flash drive and directly insert the flash drive into the frame without tranferring them onto a memory card . thank you
camera	i bought this together with the sony alpha ( very good deal from amazon ) . the lens is a great complement to the kit lens or the identical but older km 18-70 . images are very sharp and the lens is built very well . great for wildlife imaging . the other reviewers are right ; the af is n't too good at the long end of this lens but overall a great camera . the end of the lens does rotate while zooming . it may not be good for some filters
camera	the digital rebel is the most amazing camera i 've ever owned . my previous camera was a canon a90 and i loved using all the features on it [ great camera ! ] . i decided recently that maybe i should graduate to a slr because i was starting to get more creative with my photography . i spent a great deal of time researching cameras and finally decided on the digital rebel . after a few months of owning it i still am amazed . the image quality is fantastic , it 's quick and responsive , and every day using it i learn a little more . it 's the perfect intro slr camera for me because everything makes sense and it 's easy to learn . i 've gotten amazing shots that i could never dream of getting with a point and shoot . if you are finding yourself wanting a little more than a point and shoot , go for this camera , you wont be sorry .
camera	i was using this lense for a week now with d50 and i can tell you that in low light indoor shooting this lense is awesome . at 1.8f this lense should be fast enough for any semi-profesional ( like myself ) . at 8f this lense produces the most sharpest photo ever and given that you shoot in nef ( raw ) format and use photo editor software ( i use nikon 's capture nx ) photoes become master pieces . at 22f , outside group portrait are sharp to the last hairy detail on each single person . i highly recommend this lense
camera	the item was exactly as expected . the packaging for shipment , along with the other item i ordered , was unacceptable . a child could have done better
camera	while this lens has an attractive price tag , this lens has serious trouble with sharpness . only at high shutter speeds ( 1/250 and above approx . ) or with a good flash and middle apertures ( f/8 to f/22 approx . ) does it deliver sharp images . horribly slow autofocus . i am already saving to buy and l-series or the is usm version
camera	i already have 2 of the smaller versions for other lenses but wanted to be sure my efs 17-85-mm would be snug as a bug in its own pouch instead of a cheap felt sling thing . well , canon came through again with another of its soft felt line the lp1116 . this pouch is thick and has the same firm bottom made of naugahide that protects the inside lens . the cord is strong and silky and does n't open accidently the way a silky cord would . obviously we ca n't throw the pouch around and we have to be careful but it really does the trick and feels good in your hand . the moment i buy another lens , i shall have to buy its matching pouch
camera	this is why sony is hot ! this sexy little ( yes its really small the size of a pack of cards ) it takes perfect clear and crisp pictures and the battery life is a long 320mins perfect for a vacation , make sure to get a memory stick with it though , because w/o it it only holds about 15 pics . this is my first digital camera and i would definitely buy sony again
camera	i feel that it is just way too much money for what you get . i own a lot of professional ( canon ) equipment and gladly paid the price because they are the best things out there . but it makes little sense to market a marginal product and still expect to command a high price . i have the s80 . no complaint there . the leather case was just way too tight , which invites a fumble as you try to pull out the camera . the flap issue is an issue . the neck chain is a bit short , and similar and better items can be had for a lower price . if you shop around you can also find the li battery for less . i 'm not upset , but just disappointed with what i got for the price
camera	they arrived on time and after that everything went downhill . the batteries charged lasted atleast five hours , so no complaints there , but the charger would keep coming out from the wall . it only seemed to work if it was all the way in and it would n't stay all the way in , i tried several outlets , finally after a whole two months it no longer worked at all
camera	this was delivered so fast that it was unbelievable . they sent exactly what was pictured and it works perfectly
camera	normally i wouldnt write a review , but i have had numerous experiences with this camera that i thought i would share . my sister first bought the camera , and i was amazed with how user friendly it was and i thought the pictures turned out pretty well . shortly afterward , her screen blacked out , without any great impact or weather damage . naturally , i assumed it mustve gotten bumped in the wrong way , tough luck . i then proceeded to buy one for myself , and a couple of months after i had it , my screen also inexplicably failed to work . and then for christmas , my sister received a replacement camera for her broken one , and yet again , shortly after purchase , the screen was broken . i do accept some responsibility for the damage , i imagine that if it was in a purse in a bookbag , perhaps it got rattled around a bit . but three times ? i dont find this to be a coincidence , and i do not reccomend that you risk your money , because you too may have to replace it after 3 months
camera	this camera has a very poor lens . at 1x zoom , the barrel/spherical distortion is enormous ; try taking a picture of a tiled wall . image quality is also so-so when a picture is viewed at 100 % ; scaled down on a computer monitor , the quality is ok. color fidelity is next to nothing when using flash and auto white balance . [ ... ]
camera	i purchased 2 of these cameras and both of them came with a usb charging cradle that would not work . this is terrible , terrible quality control and i will never trust another casio product .
camera	i bought this camera about a month ago and i am highly disappointed with it . the quality of the pictures is very poor , showing large grain , even at shq and low iso settings . no combination of settings seems to improve quality
camera	i got this camera so i could have more control . i 'm learning to use the shutter and aperture settings ... i have n't explored all the fancy settings much , but there are tons of them . i really like the continuous shooting option so i 'm more likely to catch a good action shot . the wide-angle lens has also allowed me to get some pretty cool shots and the macro settings work great for close-ups . i think it 's one of the best buys you can find if you want to take some pretty cool photos , but do n't feel quite ready for an slr
camera	i bought this toy a year ago and tried it on my etx-90ec telescope all i got is hazy moon video , the resolution is poor the maximum pixels is 640*420 which is very pooooooor resolution it didnt reach even 1 mega pixels , hey we 've got now 12 megapixels chips why dont provide it celstron ? ? ? tried to edit it with the included poor software but it was useless i thought it might need bigger telescope so the aperture would be higher and i might able to see some stars or galaxies as per advertisement i went to my cousin who has lx90 8 '' telescope , the result was bright dots seem to be stars i dont recommend this toy its a waste of money if you want really to take serious photograph try to attach your film or digital camera to your telescope by t-adapte
camera	the camera case only works if you wear a belt -- there is no clip on . the case itself holds only the camera , not even space for a spare battery or memory card . ( i 've heard the case will darken your camera , but i did n't end up using the case ) . the neck strap is not useful , it 's too long . at '34 inches , if you 're not careful you could swing your camera into something and break it . ( the canon camera rocks , however .
camera	i 'm using it for a few months now ; i have n't found a single problem so far . earlier , i was using an old finepix and the optic/sensor sensitivity was not very good ; poor quality of photos taken in dark environment . this is not a problem any more . also , i was impressed with the sharpness of photos of sport actions taken with 10x zoom . in general , i was pretty enthusiastic about all the features of this camera ; it took me nearly 3 days to try everything out : - ) . sure , there are better cameras on the market ; however , considering the price it is just a great deal
camera	i 've had this digital camera for almost a year . it 's the fourth camera i 've owned . i spent quite some time searching for a compact camera that i could carry everywhere . being an amateur photographer ( and mostly taking pictures for myself and not others ) , i did n't want to lug around an extra bag just for my camera . it fits discreetly in your pocket or a small purse ( for formal nights out ) . the size and weight of this camera is its best feature , and this carries through to the newer generations of this camera , too . this has been the perfect camera for everything from selling items on-line to landscape scenery . my pictures have always turned out beautifully , with wonderful color and crispness . i have discovered that the `` automatic '' lighting feature is not always the most ideal , but you can re-program just about anything on this camera . it 's really quite a good camera , and given its price these days with the newer generations out there , it 's a steal
camera	this camera is a waste of money and should be taken off the market . after purchase we were never able to retreive pictures . the computer would recognize the camera but stated that no pictures were available to download . it not only is difficult to use but not even an adult could figure out how to take a picture and this product is made for a child . the instructions are complicated and eventually you give up . even putting in the batteries is complicated and you need a screwdriver ( the smallest one you can find ) to achieve it . unfortunately , i have wasted my money but luckily you do n't have to
camera	i got this for my s70 . first off , in order to use it , you have to set the s70 to `` radio control '' ( about 9 button pushes ) . then you had better stay no further away than six feet or so ( and only in *front* of the camera-the remote does n't work from the rear ! ) . oh , and if you want to adjust your framing , forget it-the zoom is immobilized . if you need a `` cable release , '' i strongly suggest simply using the self-timer built into the camera . it gives you 2-second and 10-second settings , and you 're almost certain to have a steady tripod by that time .
camera	bought the camera , charger and the kit as part of the deal . every thing looks good except the missing npf-50 battery . requested for a replacement . in the replacement kit also battery was missing . returned both the items . 59.99 for a carry bag and 3 dvd sis not worth buying this item
camera	this is a great camera- it 's so thin , and takes amazing pictures , even when the subject is moving . the best shot option makes taking pictures under any kind of lighting great quality . i suggest this to anyone
camera	i bought this camera and it took great pictures above water , but none of the pictures i took underwater turned out . i looked at the negatives and it was like i never even clicked the shutter . the negatives were blank where i took the underwater pictures
camera	i received this product in a timely manner . it was exactly what i needed . thank you
camera	i bought this camera in the beginning of january . i was looking for a compact camera ( not necessarily pocket size , though ) that was capable of taking great pictures and that was also capable of taking movies in a decent quality . based on test reports at dpreview and other customer reports i decided for the fuji f31fd . i was intrigued by the new sensor that fuji is using and that seems to be very light sensitive , which is true . after receiving the camera i took a lot of test pictures under various conditions , with and without flash , bright light , low light , different iso settings , different exposure times , etc . i compared the pictures with my 4-year old sony dsc-v1 and the results were amazing . the picture quality of the fuji was very poor . colors were 'smeared ' but the main problem was noise . even under bright light conditions and iso 100 settings the white had considerable noise , same with other colors ( rgb noise ) . i did n't check grey/black noise ( as they do in the test reports ) but the noise in white and colors was just too annoying . what a disappointment . the lens seemed to be pretty poor as well , at least there was no comparison to the sony dsc-v1 with a carl zeiss lens . after one week we returned the camera and i bought the sony h5 . this is really a great camera , i must admit . the picture quality is even better than with the v1 and i thought that the v1 was already pretty good . i can only recommend sony 's h5 , even though it has a different form factor and may therefore not really compare to the much smaller f31fd . what i liked about the f31fd was its size , its responsiveness and the monitor and menu . however , if the picture quality is so poor it also does n't really help
camera	this kit is just junk . the deluxe blower brush is a cheap plastic blower in the tiniest size . there is a tweezers that is just folded aluminum sheet metal - there 's no way that is getting anywhere near my cameras . there are a few sheets of lense tissue and a few swabs to use with the cleaning solution . the lintless cleaning cloth is an about 3 x 5 piece of something akin to reusable paper towels that you 'll use about three times and then throw away . this kit is not worth buying at any price , because it 's not worth the shipping charges
camera	i 've had my d70s for about a year now , have n't regretted it for a second . the controls are laid out logically , with everything to hand . the dual control wheels make adjustments fast and accurate . i personally love the optional grid overlay , i have no excuses for horizons that are n't horizontal . the wireless flash system is great , though you have to buy an sb-600 or sb-800 to get the full benefit . this camera is bigger and heavier than the d50 and d80 , which in my opinion is a positive thing .
camera	after a week the cammera did not work . the shop has a return police , but they did not send a ra number needed to return the item . they asked me an adress in the usa , and whwn i sent it they did nor answered . in my country , argentina , the local distributor said the garantee is not valid for them
camera	i have looked everywhere for this charger . everywhere in town wants me to buy something else that might work . it was great to finally find the actual charger that comes with the camera . it 's just the right size and plugs right into the wall . the prongs fold down and can fit nicely in a carry-on bag . thanks so much for having this item available
camera	i really like the size and weight of the camera . it is very easy to use and the picture quality is pretty good . i had to return the cam because the motor noise is unacceptable . i recorded some scenes while skiing and the whiny noise is very noticeable , even outdoors . all the other reviewers claiming the cam records motor noise are dead on . i will spend a bit more money and get the sony hcr-dc96 instead
camera	this is a great camera for travel and everyday events because of its small and convenient size . we bought it to replace our bulkier sony dsc-f707 . the large screen is wonderful ! the video feature is a lot of fun but due to the small size it is hard to take a steady video . the battery meter is very useful as it tells you how much time you have left . the main downside with this camera is the flash . it does n't work well in very dark conditions for distant or even slightly distant shots . if it were n't for the flash , i would have given this a rating of 5 stars . this is overall a good camera . for more serious digital photography , we prefer to use the sony dsc-f707 as it has a better flash and zoom . however , it is too bulky to carry around
camera	the is-dv only records videos in the 'asf ' format , not mpeg-4 . i bought one from 'egghead.com ' . after 30 days , i contacted aiptek to tell them the problem , they acknowledged that the is-dv only records videos in the 'asf ' format . they said there is nothing they will do about it . do not buy this product . aiptek advertises that the is-dv records video in mpeg-4 format , but it does n't . 'egghead.com ' wo n't deal with me because they say i should deal with the manufacture after 30 days from the purchase date
camera	they sent me wrong lens cover and said i ordered the wrong one ... ... ... .do n't think so since i got copy ... ... .poor customer service all around ... ..
camera	i 'm sure there are those who 'd wax philosophical over the subject of filters and how one brand is `` much better '' than another , but for my canon ef-s 10-22mm on a 20d , i figure canon would be fairly good at making a filter that they 're willing to have branded `` canon . '' it fits fine , does n't interfere with the lens hood , looks clear , seems to attenuate that nasty ultra-violet part of the light spectrum and perhaps best of all , protects the front element . what more would one want
camera	this camera worked very well until the lens got jammed in its extended position . i sent the camera for warranty service ( i had it less than 7 months ) , and they refused to honor the warranty because it was a bit scuffed and a little decorative ring on the end of the lens that had been attached with 2-sided tape had come off . they claimed this happened due to physical damage , but this occurred during normal use : i was just changing modes and the lens did n't retract . do n't bother trying to get warranty service unless the unit looks brand new . even then , do n't be surprised if they renege on the warranty . i had another a410 that did the very same thing ( lens got jammed ) , but was stolen in a break-in before i sent it out for service ( so i suppose it was no loss after all ) . obviously there is a design flaw that causes the lens to extend too far and come off track inside . in short , this camera is not suitable for frequent use in the field . if you buy it , and plan to use it a lot , expect to be buying another camera or paying for a repair that should be covered under warranty ( which i 'm not doing ) soon .
camera	we returned this video camera due to video picture quality . the camera requires a lot of light to have a decent video , even after changing settings , the video had a `` grainy '' look . we just needed something basic to replace our 10 year old video camera and thought this would work , but the picture was worse than our previous camera . purchased the pv-gs65 , next model up with 3ccd 's and love this model . as a matter a fact we still had the gs-31 , used the same tape , shot the same footage , and reviewing the two different shots , the gs-65 did 100 % better . the camera has a great feel in your hand , although the menu button can be difficult to press
camera	i have owned this camera for about a year and i have never really enjoyed it . for a point and shoot it is bad , it takes pictures way too slowly and i often miss out on a good shot . it is also not as user friendly as i would have hoped it to be with so many scene settings . while i enjoy some of them , most of the time my pictures turn out grainy ( in low light ) , whitewashed ( with flash ) or blurry ( of even slowly moving objects ) . i have tried changing the exposure time and shutter speed to counter some of these things , but i rarely get a good picture when i need it . i never had these problems with my elph s200 . this camera is also a lot more bulkier as well , and the cover over the lens has started to stick so that it does not fully open when turned on . if given the option i would not buy this camera again
camera	has any one tried the compatible battery from power101 ? i ca n't believe the price . i am struggling btwn buying the sony brand battery and the compatible ones
camera	i bought this frame as a gift for my husband and he was extremely disappointed with the grainy quality of the photos . we promptly sent it back for a refund . i would recommend spending the money on a better digital frame or save your money altogether and create a slideshow screensaver on your computer monitor !
camera	one of the most disastrous purchases we 've ever made . it works fine until you try to get the video images onto your computer . do n't bother trying to consult the instruction guide ; it 's the worst one you 've ever seen . you could go to the website to attempt to download all the drivers that you supposedly need , but they 're not actually on the website . definitely find another brand
camera	this case is vital to protect the lightweight s1 which could be easily damaged from a drop . the case does not detract from the convenience of the s1 , it adds virtualy no bulk to the camera so that it still slips in a pocket or a purse easily .
camera	the other day i used a friend 's standard digital camera for a little while . the whole time i found myself missing the manual zoom , instant response and convient manual buttons on my d50 . this camera takes amazing pictures . as an dslr beginner i used the camera in auto mode for the first several weeks , now after reading some books on photography i 'm slowing starting to use the manual features . the d50 lets me choose the level of control that i 'm comfortable with , from full manual to full automatic ; and both options are just a turn of the dial away . the body of this camera is built like a tank . metal and high quality plastics abound . the buttons provide good feedback and the switches feel solid and durable . it is a beautiful piece of precision engineering
camera	this is a nice looking brown suede camera case . based on all the stylus models listed , i assumed my olympic stylus 595 would fit in it but , unfortunately , it does not .
camera	i dropped the camera from 2 feet and the metal outer rim of the lens slightly became bent and wo n't close . after some time spent tring to bend the metal back in place , i finally was able to close the lens . besides that , it is an awesome camera . i am able to pick out a color ( ex . red ) and take a picture with that color standing out and everything else black and white . no photoshop needed
camera	i do not trust any batteries except canon for my canon cameras . i have found `` compatible '' batteries do not always charge in canon charger , and do not last as long on camera
camera	i purchased this camera for shooting product photos for our website . i had been using a nikon coolpix at 5mp and wanted something relatively low cost with higher mp for the next few years . we plan to purchase something totally outlandish in a few years for super-quality printed photos , but for now , this camera is an excellent investment . easy and small enough for everyone in the company to carry on trips abroad , but inexpensive enough to not break our hearts if pocket-picked or eaten by a hyena . i 've read some reviews that talk about blurred photos ... i 'm really surprised . i began using ours after i had my son , so many photos were taken without a tripod , one hand holding a nursing child and the other shooting photos ... and none of the images turned out blurry . i have taken a few photos of my son now that he 's a six-month-old super action hero that look like cotton candy on my nikon but turn out crystal clear on the sony . the movie mode is a real plus . i 'm actually on this page today because i 'm looking to buy one of these for my personal use with video recording in mind . we have a digital video camera , but with plenty of 1g memory cards in hand , i 'd rather record action with this camera -- the quality and sound are worlds better . this is a lovely little low-cost camera that 's suitable for a wide range of users . i love it
camera	up to you , but i would buy a generic branded battery of the same type ( lithium bp522 ) . i bought a generic battery and it works just as well -- saved me $ 50
camera	i enjoy all the features of this item . the main compartment that hold the camera is soft and secure . you can open it without worrying about your camera falling off . the back compartment is roomy enough for all the basic gear . the slot for memory cards 1-4 ( depends on the card type ) , batteries ( roomy for four aa ) , and cables can fit in it . the shoulder strap is basic and looks flimsy . it 's not long enough to hold comfortable diagonally but on the side is good . the belt loop is very secure and can fit on belt three inch in width . it can even handle the worst environment ever . hot , dry climate with sandstorms and occasional accidental drops . it has protected my dig . camera very well
camera	im not from usa . my brother bought me the camara in a trip three months ago and it is not working ! ! it has serious conection problems in the body that i cant fix in my country . i lost 1000 us
camera	i bought this camcorder 3 months ago and , after using it a grand total of 6 times , it is broken . it constantly loses track of timestamp on the tape doing things like rewinding 2 minutes ( two minutes on the counter in the display ) , refusing to rewind anymore and telling me the tape is full . it 's a 60 minute tape and it can only record 2 minutes ? ? ? i figured that was a problem with the tape so i tried another one , which seemed to work fine until i got home and tried to watch the footage . the camera counter once again became confused and the whole camera just locked up . i had to power off and on several times before finally getting the camera to rewind the tape to where i needed it to be . lastly , the mechanism for ejecting the tape broke after only one month . one last note , the support for panasonic is horrible too . you ca n't talk to a `` real '' person and instead have to go through an annoying robotic voice recognization `` person '' . i 'll never buy another panasonic product again ... give me sony
camera	i purchased this camera for my 13-yr old daughter as her first digital camera . it was a christmas present so i am highly dissapointed that 3 months after purchase , the flash stopped working . the picture quality was good but it hardly makes up for the fact that she can no longer take photo 's indoors or in low light . i would not recommend this camera .
camera	i bought this camera in oct 2005 . i brought it everywhere . loved it . in april 2006 , the lcd screen blew . canon replaced it with a refurbished camera . in march 2007 , the exact same thing happened to the screen and now they will only repair for $ 97.00 , as they have determined this is the result of impact damage . how they determine this is unclear to me , as it was not dropped or impacted ... apparently , you will spend 100.00/yr maintaining this camera . that , to me , is the hallmark of a faulty product . unfortunate - as i really loved this camera
camera	i bought this for my mother ... she loves it ! its easy for her to use and the screen is large enough for her to view . the print quality is excellent . i got more ( merchandise and quality ) with this hp brand than i would had with any other brand . the price was excellent too . good job hewlett packard for making me a `` smart '' person
camera	i just got this camera a week ago and thought it was great . but today i tried to turn it on and it 's completely dead ! i even changed out the batteries and it 's still completely dead . this is the first digital camera i 've had and i bought it because i 'm going to europe ( two days after it died ) . now i have to scramble to get a replacement before i take off . grrrrr ! !
camera	the only two drawbacks to this lens are that it requires a huge amount of light to take quality photographs and it is relatively slow to autofocus , especially where there is not adequate light . aside from this it is a good but not great lens . it is probably worth the money that it cost , however , i believe that a better lens would be the 70 - 300 mm vr which costs about 4x the price of this lens
camera	great camera . . . one of the few lower priced cams to keep the mic jack and the headphone jack , but beware . .. . this camera does not come with a lens cap , and no remote control . other sources state that this camera does not have a leica lens . this camera does not have a/v input . no flash , no hot accessory shoe ( though it has one which has no power ) . no widescreen lcd . it does record in widescreen but no image stabilization in widescreen .
camera	this is a great lens for any user , professional or amateur . this lens offers incredibly wide focal lengths all while giving very impressive/clean results . a slight distortion is noticeable when shooting at 10mm ( 16mm cropped ) but this is easily correctable with software . in addition , the very fast and absolutely silent usm is a huge plus . i highly recommend this lens to anyone wanting great landscapes or great in door/architecture shots ( especially realtors )
camera	i love this battery charger ! i used to use store bought aa batteries for my olympus digital camera , but after keeping the batteries in the camera for only a week , the batteries were drained of power . for some reason , this twin battery pack can stay charged for a few months if i am just storing my camera . highly recommended
camera	i purchased this camera case for the kodak z650 . this case is perfect for the kodak z650 . it looks and feels like a high quality camera case and does allow for the storage of an sd card or two . i 'm very happy with this purchase
camera	i had high expectations when purchasing a laser range finder for use on the golf course . after a lot of research , i settled on the pro tour laser . as previous reviewers have stated , this unit is very hard to stabilize . i have a feeling this is true of all lasers . even with supporting both elbows on the hood of a car i found this unit very hard to find yardages for objects beyond 150 yards paricularly when bright sunlight is present . on the golf course , finding the flag and obtaining a yardage at longer yardages is almost impossible if there are objects behind the flag such as trees or landscaping . this unit has been returned and i have gone to a standard handheld gps instead . once the center of the green is initially saved as a waypoint , this is a very reliable and quick method to get a yardage , you just have to convert feet or 1/100 's of a mile into yards . i do this with a chart taped on the back of the gps . accuracy is about 2-4 yards which is good enough for anyone but a vey low handicapper . i am staying away from a laser finder until golf courses uniformly put reflectors on their poles .
camera	i bought this hood after reading elsewhere that it fits the 50mm f/1.8 mark i ( the version with the metal mount and distance scale ) that i purchased recently . canon specs the discontinued es-65 hood for this lens . the great thing about this et-65iii is that it is longer , so it blocks more stray light without vignetting on full-frame or 1/6-frame slrs . the interior on this mark iii version is also flocked , providing a bit more light absorption . i 've used those collapsible rubber hoods before while in college , but this hood is definitely worth the investment : well built , fits backward on the lens for storage ( but too long while the lens is on the camera ) , and provides good protection for the front of the lens ( it 's quite deep ) . note that this will not fit the newer 50mm f/1.8 mark ii version ( all plastic mount with no distance scale )
camera	this battery for my cannon camera is a great little `` back up '' battery . my camera came with a cannon battery and charging unit . the replacement cannon battery sells for over $ 40.00 so purchasing this cta battery at less than $ 10.00 is a very good choice .
camera	pros : - reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light . - helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches . - somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall . better to break the hood than the front element . - makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps keep others from carelessly walking in front of you . cons : - will increase lens movement in windy situations , kind of like a sail on a boat . - takes up more room in your bag , even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens . - people take more notice of you , will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile
camera	i am very happy with this set of filters . the price was right and they come with a carry case so you dont have to worry how you are going to carry them if you go lite , camera and filters
camera	i am impressed with the quality of photos with this camera . occaisionally when i turn it on the lense doies n't slide out , which is a little disconcerting . however , if i tap it , or turn it off and turn it o n again , it comes out to the operational position . i enjoy using it , amd would n't hesitate to purchase another one
camera	getting great pictures from this new flash for my sony digital slr camera
camera	this was a great addition to the `` photography basket '' i made my grandson for easter
camera	if you use the viewfinder instead of the lcd field , it does not appear on the lcd , you can only see it through the viewfinder . this is different from previous models . minor annoyance . the quality of the videos was surprisingly good , but it saves them in the quicktime .mov format . mov is not my favorite format , but perhaps others will not be bothered by this . although i had heard that the color on kodaks is not natural , i have found it to be excellent . the overall quality of the pictures is good . for the price , i think this is a very good value and adequate for most casual photographers .
camera	this camera has an attractive look and price but it does not take good pictures . i bought this camera for my 12 year old daughter and although she was happy with it ( she 's happy with anything pink ) i was very disappointed at the quality and functionality
camera	i was not satisfied with the quality of the digital pictures on this ziga digital frame . i returned it
camera	i 've had this camcorder for a week now and i think it works great .. except for the touch screen feature . that takes a little getting used to .. especially when accessing the special features ( such as fader effects ) while filming . the digital still quality is poor when recording directly to the memory stick .. but the same images taken as a still from prerecorded tape is much clearer . all in all it is a good product .. just takes some getting used to
camera	i purchased the canon off camera shoe cord to use with the canon ex 580 for weddings . i needed the cord to use the flash on a braket to avoid red eye . it does what it 's supposed to . no complaints .
camera	this is not at all suitable for young children . it 's awkward and difficult to use . we 're sending it back . totally inappropriate for children
camera	i recently purchased the g600 printer dock and have n't even gotten to try it out yet -- the print cartridge that came with it did n't work . i ordered another and inserted it and it still does n't work . it constantly tells me the cartridge is empty and needs replaced . lots of time and money involved in this mess -- -stick with hp !
camera	this bag is great for your slr digtial camera . it has space for your extra lens . everything that came with you slr camera fits in this bag . this bag is a great buy and its not that expensive
camera	grainy iso 100 pictures at any light conditions . usage of 5mp and low sharpness options partially solves the problem , but if you take pictures with panasonic dmc-fz7 and compare ... it will be clear that a garbage trash is the right place for this camera . i had panasonic dmc-fz7 and the only cons . is really noisy high iso sensitivity mode . in fz8 camera panasonic implemented the venus iii processor ( fz7 has venus ii processor ) . as a result picture quality really improved at high iso sensitivity modes but dramatically changed for the worse in iso 100 mode
camera	isiklandirmanin iyi olmadigi yerlerde netlik sorunu oluyor . birde floresan isik altinda beyaz dengesi tam tutmuyor . diger ozellikleri gayet guzel . bellek kartina cekim yapabiliyor olmasi cok guzel
camera	the camera case only works if you wear a belt -- there is no clip on . the case itself holds only the camera , not even space for a spare battery or memory card . ( i 've heard the case will darken your camera , but i did n't end up using the case ) . the neck strap is not useful , it 's too long . at '34 inches , if you 're not careful you could swing your camera into something and break it . ( the canon camera rocks , however .
camera	through most of the 1990s , i lived overseas in both europe and asia . unfortunately , my number of photos from these times are limited to a handful as i hated looking like a `` tourist '' with my bulky camera ! nowadays , i no longer have to worry about that because of cameras like this one ! i intially bought this t7 after using a friend 's t1 and being impressed with the size of it . the t7 is obviously considerably smaller , which is even better ! i bought this camera right as they were coming out and paid well over $ 400 for it plus a 1gb memory stick pro . both are investments that even to this day ( over a year later ) i am very happy with . i have taken this camera just about everywhere and wherever i go people love to look at it . i can say i 've probably sold at least a dozen of these to people that fell in love with the size of the camera and the quality of photos it takes . as far as size , that is the biggest plus to it 's advantage . it can fit anywhere . even with the optional case that you can buy for it , it still easily fits in a trouser or jacket pocket , without even a noticable bulge . as far as photo quality goes , as most of the reviews note , the camera is very limited when it comes to night time shots . i 've found that these shots are often hit and miss as far as what you 'll get , but for the size of the lens and the size of the flash , what can you expect ? after shooting a few thousand photos with this camera , i know what will be a good and bad night shot , and with the playback feature , you can quickly see the quality of your photo and retake if needed . is it perfect ? no , but that 's super tough in a camera this small . some reviews note the difficulty trying to take a photo while holding the camera still . i 've never had issue with this , but i could see how it could be an issue , it 's just never one either my wife ( the primary user ) or i have dealt with . i would venture that probably the vast majority of buyers of this camera will likewise not have a problem . i 've recorded more than a few .mpg movies with the camera and it surprisingly outperformed some of my bigger ( and more expensive ) point-and-shoot digital cameras . i have been very pleased with that . another drawback noted by many reviews is the lcd screen and the chance of breaking it . i put a plastic screen protector ( the thin plastic sheet type held by static ) on it as soon as i bought it and have n't had a problem . i 've sat on the camera before ( by accident , of course ! ) and have had it in luggage and the like , but have never had a problem . the most significant drawback that i 've had with the camera is that it can take more photos ( esp with the 1gb card ) than the battery will last . buy a second battery and you 'll be more than good , but it 's just something to keep in mind . i would highly recommend this camera for anyone who travels , or anyone who wants a camera to take quick photos . it can be carried anywhere and for the vast majority of shots , it 's all that you need . i can say that we have many photos of our kids ( and really good ones , too ) that we would never had gotten if my wife did n't regularly carry this camera in her purse and diaper bag ! i 'm happy enough with it that i 'm going to buy a second one for myself ( especially now that the prices have dropped so much ! ) so that my wife can use our first one entirely for her own photography . i give it five stars and would definately recommend it to others
camera	for the price paid , this is a great camera . should last me for a long time . debated buying a slr , but this seems to have all the features of an expensive slr ( actually it is a slr , just no interchangable lenses ) and a lot easier to use
camera	this camera/mp3/camcorder/webcam/voice recorder is way to good to be true ! i brought one because it was cute and looked perfect for mini movies . but i was sadly mistaken ... this camera just takes cheap pictures and videos . the only thing that actully worked properly was the voice recorder that i had no need for . after about 3 days of trying to make it work a little better i gave up and sold it on ebay for the same price as i brought it for . it 's a great idea ... but it just is n't a good camera but if you want a voice recorder this is pretty nice . the mp3 player is n't all that wonderful either . it does n't work with itunes . or easy work with windows . hope this helps ... i wish i would have read this before i brought this camera
camera	my kids can see better through a toilet paper roll than this `` telescope . '' meaning , you ca n't see a freaking thing through it . do n't waste your money
camera	i was completely prepared to give this tripod a five-star review . it 's lightweight but sturdy , easy to assemble and disassemble , and very adjustable . i used it to tape a church service and sat it next to me in the pew with its legs retracted , like a short tripod , and it was wonderful . it 's also nicely finished , and when you collapse the tripod and tighten its knobs , it stays together and does n't flop around while you 're toting it . unfortunately , that evening i had trouble docking our new sony camcorder , and when i looked at the bottom of the camcorder , i saw that the stabilizing pin from the tripod quick release had broken off in the camera ! to my great relief , i was able to pull out the pin with no trouble , but the angst factor was pretty high there for a couple of minutes . i was very careful attaching and removing the camera from the tripod , so this is not `` consumer error . '' ( i ca n't keep the quick-release plate permanently attached because then i ca n't dock the camcorder ... bad on sony there ... but still . ) your mileage may vary , but this tripod is going back to amazon , and i 'll be shopping for another brand .
camera	i 've been using 35mm slr cameras for over 30 years . for the last 9 or 10 years i have gone through several under $ 400 digital cameras as the technology has improved . this kodak z710 is a very economical compromise . the built-in 10x optical zoom is a great feature . the z710 does not have image stabilization ( is ) as do some of the more expensive models but if you have a moderately steady hand and you press the shutter button rather than pound it ( and the whole camera ! ) that 's not really a problem . another feature of this camera that i really appreciate is the manual settings position which allows much more creative control of a shot . check out the kodak web site for more information on this . i bought this camera from an amazon dealer for less than $ 200 shipped to me . that 's cheaper than a reconditioned unit ( same model ! ) recently sold on ebay
camera	bought this camera for my wife . takes good pictures but handle this camera with extreme caution . if you drop it be prepared for a large repair bill . fuji customer relations is sub-par . warranty does not cover any impact internal damage . i 've had better luck with nikon and kodak and will steer clear of fuji in the future
camera	one of the reviews i read before purchasing these suggested that the reviewer should 've had them for her celine dion concert . i took the suggestion and they were perfect ! they fit nicely in my evening bag and brought celine closer to me as i sat in the second mezzanine at caesar 's palace ! not only that - but the price was right ! i could n't be happier ! plus , now i have them for our next trip to rocky mountain park to get up close and personal to some wildlife
camera	did not get kodak max , instead recieved regular kodak crv3 battery . i thought i was ordering a better version , seller needs to change misleading picture !
camera	i won the kodak printer at a scrapbook convention then went on the hunt to find the refills at a reasonable price . purchasing the 160 count made the price per print the lowest beat out anything i could find in the local stores . it is a great convenience to be able to whip out a 4x6 print instead of having to download it to a store 's website , wait a few days , go there pick it up , etc . great value
camera	works as great as orignal battery . you will never know the difference except that is a lot cheaper !
camera	this cable did not fit my camera as stated . because of the cost factor , i chose not to return it . the shipping was more than the cable was worth
camera	this camera took some great pictures , and i enjoyed it 's size and functionality for several months . i was sitting in a lawn chair at a barbecue last weekend when i was passing it to a friend who was also seated . the camera fell about 2 feet onto soft grass . the end . the lens assembly is shot , according to my local camera store , not economical to fix . this was about the softest fall a camera could take , and not work , it was like landing on a pillow . i will not buy hp cameras again
camera	i love this camera ! i shake when i take pictures and this easter every picture i took came out perfectly ! there are so many options on this camera i am having fun just playing with it to see what all it can do ! i would recomend this camera to anyone who is looking for a high quality camera at a good price
camera	it 's great . nice top storage for memory cards and extra battery . compact . perfect for camera size .
camera	i mainly use the camcorder for recording my kids . i bought this camcorder a couple of weeks ago . i had the sony hc-7 before for a couple of weeks which i returned to buy the canon camcorder . the high light performance of both camcorders are excellent . with the sony camcorder , i felt that the best color performance can be achieved by reducing the color intensity . the low light performance when recording 1080i is similar for the two camcorders but much better with canon when recording in 24p format . this is the main reason that i prefer the canon . the 24p recording is more sensitive to motion which can be a problem if recording motion . the still images from canon are lower resolution but to me they looked better than sony . this is especially true when taking flash pictures . the sony seems a little better built . the hdmi cover on canon is poorly built . i liked the controls on canon better than sony . the auto focus and automatic white balance worked better in canon than in sony . the auto white balance in sony worked poorly in indoor light . sony has supershot infrared recording and canon does not . sony has more manual controls than canon . [ ...
camera	my sony fx1 has great low light capability , 3 lux , but eventually you will need extra light . using your software to lighten dark shots will likely reveal some degree of graininess , no matter which camera you use . i 'm so glad i bought it . used it for my birthday party . though the overhead light was good , dark corners of the room require more light . if you consider yourself advanced , semi-pro , or a pro videographer , you must have a light . my only major beef is it runs at either 10 or 20 watts . no variable for 5 , or 15 . it is worth getting a long life battery like the np-970 . independent power source ( battery ) is a plus . but no outlet plug adaptor that i know of
camera	i do n't like pink so i bought the blue bag . i had bought a black one , but it was so skimpy i returned it and prayed until this one arrived . i had no trouble with amazon crediting me for the return , either . it was so cute ! i 'm too old for `` cute , '' but i kept it because i needed a case for my new hp r717 . it is small , yet padded enough to trust that your camera will be cushioned if you drop it . i have dropped my camera and it was not injured . it has a little pouch inside to store an extra battery for my camera , not the big aa batteries , but the flat type that come with my r717 . i recommend this little bag , or the pink one , even if you do n't like pink ... or blue . they are well cushioned and snug , but not too snug you think they will tear . the are sturdy and have nice shoulder straps and magnet closures
camera	here is the short version . oct05 i bought a fujifilm finepix f460 digital camera for $ 299.99 . nov06 camera stopped working correctly - snapshots have alternating bright/dark horizonal strips across them . jan07 i sent the camera in to fujifilm 's service center for repair stating that the camera was always handled with care and that a ~ $ 300 camera should work for more than just 1 month after its warranty expires . jan07 the service center sent me a repair estimate for $ 70.00 + tax and shipping totaling $ 85.95 ( i spent $ 16.52 to send it to them so my total expense would have been $ 102.47 for the repair if i accepted ) . feb07 i contacted the service center and stated that i think they should stand behind their product and fix the camera once they verify the malfunction was not caused by user abuse . and that i do n't think that it makes sense for me to pay $ 100 to repair a $ 300 camera that stopped working only 1 month after the warranty expired . the service rep , named christina , asked me to fax her a copy of the original reciept and she would see what she could do . i complied . mar07 fujifilm returned the camera to me unrepaired with a note saying that i did not reply to the estimate . now i will now send them the camera and its memory card and a printout of this review asking them to refund the cost of the camera , its memory card , and the shipping i paid .
camera	i have purchased the pv-gs65 and everytime i use the camera with autofocus it makes everything blurry and only stays in focus for about 3 seconds . i returned my camcorder and got another one ( pvgs65 ) and i am still having this problem . everytime i have used the camera i have to use manual focus . if anyone else has had this problem or knows how i could get this fixed please email me or post another review . brandonwg8677 @ comcast.net thank you
camera	i purchased this and spent 3 days on the phone with hewlett packard trying to get the correct adapter so it would fit my r818 camera ( the dock has a thin port , roughly 10 connectors ) while the r818 has a mini usb plug ) . hp was less than helpful when it came to trying to get the correct adapter , getting a different answer each time i spoke to a different rep ( even being told at one point that no supervisors were working ) . i was finally able to get someone willing to send me one , but said it was going to be 10+ business days to get it , which by then i 'll be on vacation ( and i purchased it well in advance giving myself time to get the adapter , thinking it was not hard to get ) . i was looking forwared to using the dock on my vacation . i would definately *not* recommend this if you have the photosmart r818 digital camera , unless you like the stress of spending hours on the phone with hewlett packard trying to get a correct part , and waiting 10+ business days to get it
camera	have used this lens from the deer stand while hunting , at sporting events ( indoor and outdoor ) and at concerts . fast focusing and great image stabilization ( is does use quite a bit more power , though ) . have not had one problem with it . solid build and has a little heft to it . it is a bit pricey , but i chaulk that up to it being about the best on the market . would recommend it to anyone looking for a top shelf lens .
camera	my husband bought me this camera for my birthday in may 2006 . i loved this camera . well , it stopped working on christmas eve . i used it that morning with no problems , put it on the charger to recharge for later that evening . when i removed the camera that evening , the screen remained black . it would not take any pictures . after talking with the customer service folks , i sent my camera in for repair . it was under warranty , and i had not done anything to break the camera . well , they voided my warranty stating that it was `` impact damage '' and my repair bill was $ 111.00 . you have got to be kidding . i called to question the voided warranty since i had not dropped the camera . the technician i spoke to explained that `` impact damage '' could happen if the camera bumped up to something in your purse . so i asked to speak to a manager . i am sorry , but if i am going to spend this much money on a camera , i expect a little better quality . i have called and email the kodak company several times to have someone talk to me . nobody has bothered to return either my calls or emails . i would seriously think twice before spending money on a camera that can break by no fault of your own only to have the warranty voided and billed an amount comparable to a brand new camera . i have discovered that the quality of a product is only as good as the company that will stand behind it .
camera	i received the remote this evening and have not been able to get the remote to work with my canon rebel xt camera . followed the directions that were furnished with the remote to no avail . it appears that this remote is defective
camera	if you have the big lenses ( 400mm f/2.8l is usm or even the 70-200mm f/2.8l is usm ) this is totally worth the addition . the 2x does not kill the autofocus on the f/2.8 and effectively doubles your lens with very little distortion around the edges . check compatability on canon 's website . you wo n't be disappointed
camera	i was going to buy this camera for my teenage daughter today , but after reading the reviews i decided that it is not a god risk if the customer service is that bad and the screen seems to break without any kind of impact . i 'm sure it takes nice pictures , but a lot of cameras take nice pictures . i have to go where the service will at least respect you .
camera	beware of this camera ! the camera overall works great . we have had it for more than a year now and it takes clear , bright pictures and is very easy to use . very nice compact size . however , as others have pointed out , the battery is the fatal flaw in this camera and we will be looking for a non-elph replacement for fear we will run into the same problem again . there is no battery meter until it needs to be recharged or replaced . we were warned about this so i thought , no problem , i 'd get two batteries and be ready to switch them when charging was needed . but what we found out is that the batteries themselves quickly retain less and less charge so that now , they last only a few minutes each before another charge is needed . i had previously thought that this problem of retaining less charge over time was only for the much older battery designs and am dismayed to find myself looking for another camera so soon .
camera	watch out they will not ship it for 40 days after you buy i
camera	at least if your going to decieve people about the lcd screen in the back , at least make the picture quality decent . i mean this barely qualifies as a picture . some pictures are so bright it just looks like a splash of light . this was sickening to me because my daughter was excited and it broke her heart when i had to return it because she expected to at least be able to see the pictures . definatly stay away from this camera
camera	i bought this sweet little thing because i am planning a day in nyc and do n't want to bring along my regular camera , which is bulky . this camera is nice and small and would fit in any purse or coat pocket . it has 5 mp and a 3x optical zoom which is great for the price . the pictures i took outside turned out outstanding . inside pics were a bit pixelated , but i may have had the settings wrong . the camera is easy to use right out of the box . perfect for a second camera to keep on you just in case
camera	this was the best item i ever bought for my camera . i do a lot of walking with my camera , and thought i would use it as a walking stick , which i do , but the best part of this monopod is what i never thought would happen . my pictures are never fuzzy ! i can take low light photos and have they come out clear . i paid very little for this item and would never be caught without it and my camera . the three levers on the bottom allow for quick expansion at all different lengths . the carrying case allows for this item to be packed next to my camera without it getting scratched
camera	the lens adaptor threads on very easily and i 've not seen any loss in color or light from using this filter
camera	i was looking for a pair of roof-prism binoculars like this , for hawk and bird watching . i had looked at swarovskis , but they were way out of my budget , nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution . these binoculars are crystal-clear , with sharp focus . the 42mm lens lets in lots of light , lots more than the 35 's i 've been using . i wear glasses and the twist- up- and -down eyecups are a blessing . there are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm , nice because i always used to lose them . for the price , these ca n't be beat
camera	the first day i took them out to hunt with them they fogged over . i brought them home and there is fog inside . also inside is some dark crap that you can not get to ... and it is on the lens . i called bushnell 's help line and they told me ... '' well , it is n't internally fog proof , just externally '' when asked about the stuff on the inside . `` that is probably fungus , that sometimes happens '' i just bought the binoculars ! ! ! he stated i could send them in and miss my entire hunting season and they would take the fungus out . avoid these at all costs ! ! ! they are a shoddy product with an even worse strap that is plastic and cuts into your neck
camera	i believe this is one of the best lens for about $ 1000 . forget about zoom lenses even if they are l. this lens is far better than 70-200l in my opinion . it is very sharp at f2 and even more sharp at f2.5 . with zoom lenses you have to set to f/5.6 for better result and f/8 to match this lens . it is very well built but not excessive heavy , come with hood and bag , but unfortunately , canon have decided to remove the hard cases for all the l lenses . combined with a tamron 1.4x teleconverter this lens provide very good optical quality on par with any zoom l lenses at 189mm focal length . yes i know i lost the convenience of a 70-200 zoom lens . but i am really happy that i decide to change the plan of buying a 70-200is to 135/2l+1.4x . this not only saves me the money but also let me to get better pictures , especially at wide open . better portrait lenses , like 200/1.8 and 300/2.8 , would cost several thousands of dollars . trust me , once you play with primes , you will not like zoom anymore . i am also using a 24-70l to shoot my small kid . after using this lens , i do n't like it anymore and thinking about change to primes someday , the only reason preventing me doing that is the 1.6x crop factor of digital camera . a 35mm/1.4l will become 56mm which is really not good . order from amazon with free shipping even though it says not in stock . they shipped mine in 2 days and this happened before even though item stated `` in stock soon '' . pros : very sharp at f2 and super sharp start from f2.5 . very fast lens with f/2 very good bokeh ( background blurring ) . overall extremely good picture quality with good contrast/color . smaller size , less weight and black color compare to those white 70-200s . it is a l lens : best build quality , fast/quiet ring usm af with ftm . cons : no hard case . no inexpensive . effective focal length is 216mm on 10d/20d/rebel/300d which is a little difficult to use for portrait
camera	i bought this battery in july 2004 . i charged it as soon as i got it . i put it in the camera and then used the camera about 10 days later . the battery was dead . so i charged it again and put it in the camera again . i used it and it seemed to work fine . but the next time i went to use the camera ( approximately 2 weeks to a month later . ) it was dead again . as i write this review i am sitting in a hotel room in prague . i charged the battery ten days ago . i used it once 7 days ago and took approximately 15 to 20 pictures ( did not use the flash ) . i then used it again today . i was able to get another 15 to 20 pictures before it went dead ( did not use the flash ) . i bought the lithium rechargeable battery because they have the longest life and no memory . so now i have to charge the battery everytime i use the camera . this was a big disappointment . i get better life out of the standard duracell alkalines . it appears that this technology has n't been perfected or that belkin has not perfected their quality control . beware when buying this product
camera	i purchased this frame as a gift for a friend of mine . when i saw it on her desk and noticed the terrible quality of the images , i was embarassed that i had given such an inferior item as a gift . perhaps the images she had loaded were quite low resolution , but the pictures looked terrible with huge pixels . i would not recommend this item at all
camera	price went up ! ! ! great value for money spent . will be buying a `` ball '' attachment for better adjustability . got some great steady shots with 48x digital zoom with the canon s2 i
camera	this is one of the four cameras , the only digital camera , i used to learn portrait photography . the class was on how to take portraits not how to use the camera . i wanted to graduate from the point and shoot but had to consider my budget because i wanted an slr film camera also . i got the canon rebel ti packed with two lenses . it made sense to me to purchase a canon digital to interchange lenses . my original choice was the canon digital rebel , however , in my web search , i found the eos 10d for $ 750 with no catch . there were no required additional purchases scam when i called . this allowed me to spend the extra money i would have spent on the camera on accessories . since it 's digital , i am not shy about trying out the features . when i first got the camera , some of the photos were dark or very light . after tinkering around and learning what the sensor-indicators means i do n't get that anymore . the 10d is more camera than i need that i 'm sure i will have it for a long time .
camera	i bought this camera because i 'm going to jamaica and i needed a camera , the video camera was a bonus . when i first tested it , it was during the night time , however in a well lit room , but i could n't see anything . i figured i could deal with that as long as it took good pictures during the day . when i stepped outside , which was very bright and sunny , all i could see on the screen was white . i tried all the settings and still encountered a white screen . the only time i actually saw anything on my screen was when i was inside during the day . i brought it back right away , thankfully i had bought it at wal-mart and they were happy to refund my money . i hope anyone reading this review will take my advice and not buy this video camera . i would have loved to give it zero stars if amazon gave that option
camera	i bought the meade captureview 8x42 1.3mp digital camera binocular . the first one had software / hardware that hung up after 3 pictures , the second one had so many pixels missing from the screen it was unreadable , the third one wouldnt turn on and the black side flashing fell off on removal from the box . a truely tatty product
camera	i purchased this at a photographic store because a professional said you should n't go higher than 1.4x . just keep in mind -- 1.4x is only `` 40 % better '' . it worked really well , but did n't increase the zoomage enough . i decided to go with a 2x ( that 's twice the zoomage ) teleconverter by kenko instead . i gave this one to my brother-in-law for christmas . you have to think about what you want -- i want to get in really close to the birds . i have a 70-300mm zoom lens and 1.4x takes it to 98-420mm . it is an improvement , but not nearly enough ! if you want to get twice as close , this is n't going to do it for you . if you want to get half-again-as close , this almost gets you there . as far as quality , the quality is definitely there . five stars for quality , 3 for insufficient zoomage
camera	this is n't a full review but some thoughts i 've had after using it for a long time . stabilization- the fact is that if this is the camera you take everywhere with you , you are going to either lose shots or have to use the flash . if flash does n't bother you , no sweat . but i 've never like the look of it . ease-of-use- great . voice memo- i use this feature all the time . it would be nice if it had a pause button because without it i end up with many small files . ex- this is where you set the exposure . casio does a great job putting everything in one place . the only thing they should have done better is that if you have changed a selection ( e.g . iso 200 to 400 ) and hit the shutter release it should take the shot . instead nothing happens . you have to click set first . it 's an extra step that you have to make during a critical time
camera	this is the worst camera i 've ever owned . i 'm not exaggerating . i 'm so upset for wasting money on it . the only pictures that turn out , are outside in bright daylight . it takes horrible pictures in low light , there 's a high level of noise in the photos . the video mode moves in and out on its own , ruining the video . i sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos . my friend 's $ 88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing . it just plain sucks .
camera	one of the reviews i read before purchasing these suggested that the reviewer should 've had them for her celine dion concert . i took the suggestion and they were perfect ! they fit nicely in my evening bag and brought celine closer to me as i sat in the second mezzanine at caesar 's palace ! not only that - but the price was right ! i could n't be happier ! plus , now i have them for our next trip to rocky mountain park to get up close and personal to some wildlife
camera	i have to agree with the other reviews of this scope . i purchased this scope as a christmas gift . when i opened it , the equatorial mount ( the basis for the entire scope ) was broken . i contacted celestron and was promised another part for it , which never arrived . i contacted the company again and finally had the replacement part shipped to me . it did n't fit . finally , i was sent another telescope to replace the original telescope . the equatorial mount was in 1 piece.. yeah ! too bad the optical tube had a screw that was bent and i could not assemble this one . i even had the chance to speak with the manager of the technical support ( who was the original person who offered to send me the part that never arrived ) and all i got was a bunch of excuses . i finally took peices from both boxes and made myself one entire telescope . it 's february and i just now have a product that works . ( i have n't had time to try it though ! ) celestron offered no refunds for this telescope , so buyer beware . if they are not willing to satisfy customers , your business is better served with a company who will stand behind the product it sells . good luck
camera	i only wish i could return this camera . its automatic focus does not work well in photographing landscape scenes and plants ( what i do most ) and its manual focus is difficult ( very difficult ) to use . my much cheaper , and lower resolution , old minolta does a much better job in low light conditions . i find i have to delete half my photographs due to bad focus . in addition , photo files take 5 to 6 seconds to save to my so-called high-speed memory card . do n't buy this camera
camera	bought the camera on a recommendation , and also what looked like good specs on the web . owned it for less than two weeks when the lcd screen cracked ( below the surface of the protective cover ) . turns out this is a very common problem with these cameras . panasonic will not warranty fix this ! if you do get one , or own one , be very careful not to use the left nav button . if you do , be very careful on the pressure you apply . this is the camera 's glass jaw , and you might end up `` bricking '' a brand new camera . i am replacing mine with a canon
camera	if you are looking for a still shot digital camera ok.. but why buy this monster for that ? i have a t1 that does the trick there and gives 5mp . ok , so maybe video ? ok , but then why do i want a dvd with nothing but raw footage ? cant edit it without a lot of work . ( where is the firewire port , or even the ability to edit an mpg file ? ) geeez.. anyway.. i am taking mine back . it is totally useless to me as i already have a still shot camera.. save your money.. dont do it..
camera	this product delivers exactly as promised and we could not be more pleased . the pictures are wonderful . the initial downloading process was straighforward and problem-free . we actually purchased three photo frames for ourselves and our children and they love them as much as we do . the slideshow feature is wonderful as well . everyone of our friends that have seen the photo frame are equally amazed by this product as some were not aware that such a product even existed . to be sure , they are expensive but worth the cost . we will enjoy our photo frame for years to come as we update with new pictures regularly . thanks to the folks at philips for getting this soooooooooooo right .
camera	i purchased , through work , the powershot s70 in july of 2005 . i 've always owned nikon products personally , but the features for the price of the s70 swayed me away from my usual nikon brand loyalty . in the 12 months i 've had the s70 , it 's been sent to the factory twice for repairs -- the second time was just 6 days before the warranty expired . the first time it was sent in was because the lens door failed to turn on the camera and it was almost to come off of its track . eight months later , the flash quit working in all modes and the door was failing again ! the flash and door problem occurred while i was in yosemite np , so you can imagine the disappointment in being in a place like that with a camera that is only half functioning . now , the warranty is expired and i hold my breath every time i slide the lens door open . i have no faith in the canon s70 and have lost a lot faith in canon products as a whole . the only bright side of this experience is that the factory repairs were completed within 2-3 weeks , which i thought was fast for warranty work
camera	i have gotten better results with sterlingtek batteries for a fraction of the price ... like less the $ 15 shipped
camera	this bag is very small . my canon 20d fits nicely with a small lens , but you can not fit more than one lens with the camera body . we kept the bag for informal use when we only need the body and one lens to avoid always having to carry a bulky bag
camera	i purchased an off brand to use with my fxf-10 when this case was on back order . it was terrrible , so i ordered this case and am thoroughly pleased . the camera fits perfectly into the case and , although it is described as a `` soft case , '' it is durable and will protect your camera with style without adding additional bulk
camera	i bougt this camera and a olymus camera , both in the same price range , the kodak camera was by far deficeint in quality of image and workmanship . avoid this at all cost the olympus was well made , durable , higher quality picture and ease of use
camera	thes item is gretes item i used befoer for these prise ! ! yes is true is very clear optics , you can see in total darknes about 350 m it 's agood rand , price and qulity .
camera	i bought this lens based on the super telephoto ability and low cost . you truly get what you pay for , and this thing is n't worth a plug nickel . i took a few shots on a tripod and could not believe how terrible this lens was @ 300mm ( 480mm on a digital rebel xt ) . incredibly soft . even stopped down , i would never want to make an enlargement from it . stay away . do n't believe the fools who are novices , you will be disappointed with this lens . you 're much better off to buy the older used 100-300mm 5.6 ( the l version costs more too ) but both are so much better than this junker . you 're even more crazy if you think you can take decent photo 's with this lens handheld . having switched from nikon when switching to digital , i almost judged canon from this one lens , which i 'm glad i did n't . do n't waste your money or learn the hard way like i did . this lens also had terrible purple fringing , almost as bad as the kit 18-55mm . after extensive research and testing i now own and am happy with the following canon lenses : canon 10-22mm canon 28-105mm ( 3.5 version ) canon 100-300mm ( 5.6 non-l version ) i will sell for the l version when i can afford it . the kit 18-55mm makes usable shots , but when i could afford it , i sold it too . you will get better results buying a rebel xt and an older 100-300mm than you would with a brand new xti and this terrible 75-300mm lens .
camera	this is a good battery and lasts for a long time . good value
camera	i so love the size and shape of this camera . this one takes some good pictures , and appear to be quite clear . it 's better than the integrated camera on my cell phone . this camera may seem like it 's taken a poor quality image , but when you transfer them onto a pc , they seem so clear ! however it is recommended that you get a memory card for this camera as it only has 14mb of internal memory . as this camera was a gift to me , i 'd have to say it was the best birthday present i have received
camera	picked mine up used on ebay for $ 180 . with the growth of the vr market everyone is dumping there old lenses . you can get a used one for a great price . this lens is great for the serious amatuer . i have taken some incredible pictures with this lens . the autofocus is a little slow and i have heard people complain about softness on the high end but i have a photo blown up to 20 x 17 taken from my d70 at 300mm . of course i shoot the photo on a tripod ... . i have not experienced the softnes
camera	i read other review , and decided to give it a try . as soon as i recieve it in the mail , and opened the box , i realized this was a mistake . cheap quality binocular with `` high power '' being a selling point . it came in already broken with two eye ruber pieces falling apart . you can see how the cheap glue was being used to put it in place ! it is extremly heavy to hold in hands for more than one minute for nature observation . you will be constantly ajdusting the focus . your fingers bumps with focus bar while you are holding it . indeed strap , case , lense protectors are all cheap crap , and annoying to have it all on~ ! i am taking this back , and buying made in japan `` nikon eagle view '' 100 times better . you get what you pay for~ ! ! ! ! !
camera	it was suggested by amazon.com that i buy this product since i was purchasing a canon powershot s2is digital camera . not knowing any better , i bought it . it does n't even work with this model camera . i bought a memory card reader instead at a local store bypassed the need for an adapter altogether
camera	offers no eye comfort whatsoever . magnification is very weak . stick to original eye cu
camera	the battery works as specified , the pricing was excellent and the order came in very timely . i 'm completely satisfied with this product and vendor
camera	this microphone is listed as a compatible accessory for the sony hdr-hc7 video camera on most websites , including sonystyle . while the microphone may be of good quality ( i did n't have an opportunity to thoroughly test it ) , it is only marginally compatible and a very poor choice for the hdr-hc7 . the microphone does plug into the mic jack on the camera and appears to work , but the shoe does not fit the hot shoe bracket on the camera . ( note that there is no direct way to tell if it is actually working without playing the tape back , at which point it 's probably too late to make a correction . ) after nearly an hour of very irritating chat room discussion and , finally , direct conversation with a sony technician , i learned that there is a `` jury-rigged '' bracket that will allow you to attach the microphone near the camera on a tripod . otherwise , there is no way to fix it to the camera . the sony technician finally admitted that it was `` curious '' that sony lists this as a compatible microphone . if you have a sony hdr-hc7 , choose a different microphone !
camera	this is a great camera . plenty of resolution . excellent shot speed . sturdy frame . the kit lense does n't do the camera justice . buy the body separate and add a better lense . on the bad side , i had a small glitch with the camera 's firmware soon after purchase and had to return it for a fix . it was two months before the camera was returned . sorry , canon ... you lose a star for that
camera	as an owner of the sony dcr-hc30 model dv handicam , i want to warn everyone about my horrible experience with this product line . design and feature-wise , these handicams are great . the problem is , they are built like junk . from the day i opened my box , i got a message that told me that the heads were dirty and needed to be cleaned . in retrospect , i should have returned it for a replacement then and there . but being a basically optimistic guy , i decided it just got dirty in transit , and i got a head cleaner and cleaned the heads . it worked fine for about 30 days - just about the amount of time in sony 's crappy labor warranty . and from that point forward , i have gotten dirty head messages constantly , which at first could be `cleaned away , ' but now , even when the message is gone , problems persist . i often get bars across the screen during playback , and i have already determined that i have lost many a precious memory of my infant children . sony 's solution to this situation is their standard `` flat rate '' repair program , truly a bargain for $ 250 or so - more than half what i paid for the camera in the first place . and sony wonders why their brand value has all but disappeared ? they are just another electronics brand now , and one with sub-par quality and service at that . guess i 'll be buying samsungs or canons next time around . are you listening , sony ?
camera	this battery is backwards compatible with the d50 , d70/70s , and is used in the d80 and d200 . so if you have any nikon dslr and want a second battery , you want to get this one so that when you upgrade your camera you can use the battery . this battery has built-in circuitry that tells you the actual charge status of the battery , and it is accurate . this is a big deal ; *if you are using the d200 or d80* it lets you know when your really do need to switch batteries or charge up . this is the first battery i 've seen that is accurate in this regard . kudos to nikon . ( this feature does not work in the d50/70/70s but the battery otherwise works fine )
camera	even though amazon specifically recommended this bag for the panasonic lumix ( dmc-fz20pp ) camera , and even though i had to return it because it was too small , and even though my camera does not appear on the compatibility list shown in another customer 's review , amazon annoyingly continues to recommend this bag for my camera . to add insult to injury , amazon tried to deduct shipping from my refund by claiming that the error was not their fault . ( it took two emails to get the full refund , and that was even after i put a large message in my return box not to deduct shipping -- aargh ! ) regarding the bag itself , construction seemed sound and this might be a good bag for a small point-and-click camera that requires no accesories
camera	this is a poor excuse for a lens coming from canon . can only be used at a certain zoom or you will get a circular ring around the photo . please do not waste your money like i did
camera	i bought the camera in may of 2006 , as a graduation gift for my son . he loved the style and compactness . he experienced focus/zoom problems after 1 use . unfortunately he did n't start to use the gift for 2 months or i might have been able to return to amazon for a refund . contacting fufifilm has been overly cumbersome . their website is not straightforware and their voice response system is not user friendly or responsive ( long waits ) . they have had the toy camera ( as this is being written ) for over a week and when i called yesterday for status , they told me that the camera `` has n't been diagnosed yet '' . i expect it will be , once their 90 day warranty expires , which will limit fujifilm 's liability to the 1 repair . i have a mean case of buyer 's remorse . i might as well have taken the ~ $ 235.00 spent on this camera and tossed it in the street . if you own one and it does n't require repairs , you might like it . if it ever requires repairs , you might feel as i that you would have been better to purchase a disposable digital camera . save yourself the potential aggravation and look to a camera that has a longer warranty , a better support environment or by all means purchase the extended warranty . you may still face the frustrations but will have the consolation of knowing that it will cost you no more then shipping to have it repaired . i bought it in may of 2006 ... .i feel like i lost it in july of 2006 . if i could have given the z1 less then 1 star , i would have . that 's what it deserves ! ! % $ $ # # 444en fujifil
camera	i bought this camera to take pictures of my sons playing basketball . my other camera shot dark grainy pictures indoor . i have had a lot of success with this and really nice outdoor shots as well . what i just started playing with , and i love is the video feature . it is so easy to use and the images are better than i expected . i bought this camera in december as a present to myself and i have used it constantly and recharged the battery twice . this is major to me as my nikon was devouring batteries in an afternoon . the optical zoom is clean , but the digital is definitely noisy . i have had fun shooting pictures of my kids because the shutter speed is so quick and i do n't miss the shot .
camera	cons only , no pros : the velcro closure is week and opens easily terrible look the side zippers are a mistery , totally useless no space for extra memory or battery attaches only to a very small belt the flash opens spontaneously while inserting the camera in its pouch making it difficult to get it out later on and probably damaging the flash
camera	far better models for similair price range - dissapointed with the quality of the finish etc etc . works fine though .
camera	i have had several people take my pictures.at first , everything is fine.the pictures are ok.the next day , my face looks like a pile of baby vomit.it is soooo blury.then it got 2 the point where every picture i took was blury.i tried fixing it online ( like on the program for the camera ) and it would not work.i hate this camera ! ! ! not to mention the battery sucks.it lasts maybe 3 1/2 hours.this camera should be $ 99.00.trust me people ... ... if i could rate this thing at a zero i would.it is not worth it.however , a camera i absolutely love is the sony cybershot dsct5.an awesome little camera
camera	excellent ! they have a really long life and are the perfect backup for your rechargeables
camera	when i had seen this camera on net , i had anticipated to be quite big but this one is really small handy ... except for the lcd panel which is cumbersome to open always , its a great camera ... the zoom is amazing and so is the image stabilization to go with it ...
camera	i bought a sony icd-mx20 digital voice recorder a week ago . i was surprised that sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named `` digital voice editor '' . sony customer service staff told me that if you lost the cd that came with the box , you had to buy a new one . only patches of the software are available to download . the customer service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device . this immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged . sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post-sales services . think twice before making your buying decision .
camera	instead of this pick up a plextor convertor box . it takes the output of the camcorder ( composite/rca or s-video ) and compresses that to mpeg-2 ( dvd ) or mpeg-4 ( or divx ) and includes software which easily burns that to dvd or cd ( mpeg-1 or mini dvd ) . look for plextor 's m402u box . unless you really want to deal with 3.125 mb of data per second ( 25 mbps ) , or about 180 mb per minute , or about 11 gb per hour through the firewire link , get the m402u . your options will be greatly expanded , and you wo n't tell the difference by looking
camera	i purchased this camera to use with my previous church 's media ministry , based on my trial use of the vx2000 . that was three years ago . this camera is still running as well as it did when i bought it . i use it upwards of 3 times a week to create content for web and dvd production , plus , i get great digital audio recordings when i plug directly into my current church 's sound system . the ability to tweak audio and video input on the fly is incredible . now that i am creating a multimedia team for our church , i 've convinced the church to buy one for themselves
camera	not too long after i purchased this camera the screen turned white when i turned it on . i would turn it off and on and nothing would help . finally i would take the batteries out and put them back in . this seemed to fix the problem a few times . after that i thought it was just operator error . but it was n't . the camera finally gave out and the white screen never went away . so after being annoyed i left the camera alone for awhile . an event came up about a month later . i got my camera and tried to turn it on . nothing happened . so i changed the batteries . still nothing happened . i 'm not sure what happened . i do believe i purchased a lemon camera . i 'm hoping to resolve these issues with samsung . it was one of the cheapest cameras on the market at the time . so i guess you get what you pay for !
camera	if you purchase this lens adapter for the xacti hd1a , you will not be able to take still photos using the built in flash . the adapter blocks the flash and causes black shadows in the bottom half of your photos
camera	try to call panasonic customer service @ 1-800-973-4264 and tell them you have question about your camcorder first . panasonic service is the worst one in this world .
camera	i bought this camera to replace a 3mp kodak cx series when i thought i had lost it . my 3mp took great pics and i never had any problems with it and i did n't want to have to learn to use a different brands software . the kodak easyshare software did n't impress me much when i bought the first camera but they have made some improvements and the updated version is much better . the kodak gallery is a nice option that allows you to share pics without sending large email files . i have n't used the c533 a lot since i bought it but the pics i 've taken have come out great . but just like the other reviews state , slow shutter speed at low light and it does like batteries . however , if you spend the extra money for the lithium batteries you 'll get much improved battery life . all in all a great value and a perfect camera for a point and shoot person
camera	of course , it had to be kodak . no matter what people say , i have always and will always use a kodak digital camera , i 've found this camera to be a real warrior , last one i had lasted about 4 year and this one looks even better , photo cuality its very good and colors are great , no excesive blue or red in your pics , night photo taking its excelent in close shots . 4 stars beacuse its really a batterie eater , but its nothing a 25 $ batterie charger can`t solve . sorry for grammar mistakes but english is not my natal lenguaje
camera	my 5-year old daughter spent all day taking pictures of her and her baby sister in san francisco . we put new batteries in that morning . the next day i was wondering why the picture numbers had reset . when i tried to download the pictures to my computer , they were all gone , and the battery icon was flashing . based on what i 've read here , it appears the batteries died after one day of use and the pictures were all erased . the picture quality is about the same as an old camera phone -- pretty poor , but good enough for my 5-year to enjoy . but what good is that when there are n't even any pictures the next day . i 'm hoping the store will take it back
camera	i am pleased with the purchase . very good value . picture quality is good and it is easy to operate . only negative is that it was advertised as wood frame when in fact it is plastic . however , it looks good . this is my second purchase of this product : one for myself and one as a gift
camera	this is the worst camera i have ever owned in my life . i had a fuji 1.3 mega pixle camera that took better pictures than this one ! i have taken this camera on 2 vacations now , and both times i brought along my olympus slr film camera , and both times , the olympus pictures are clearer , brighter and all but maybe 1 will work , with this stupid sony cybershot , i end up deleting 3/4 of the pictures because they are blury or have all kinds of funny things happening , the only pictures that do work with this camera is during the day time , or in bright lighting . on the first vacation i went on with this camera , my friend brought along her kodak 1 megapixel camera she got free and it turned out better pictures , as did my olympus , on the second vacation i returned from today as i write this , i just downloaded my pictures , and deleted 2/3 's of them because they are so bad , the ones that came off my film camera are perfect ! my sister also has the exact same camera which she brought with her , and as i went through her pictures , same thing over 2/3 's of them did n't work , i would have just assumed i 'd gotten a defective camera if it was only my sony that did not work , however hers did n't either , i would also assume perhaps it was myself that was the problem , however , i took a number of the exact same picture on this sony as well as my olympus ( as a back up and thank god i did ) and the pictures from the olympus , as well as every other camera i have ever used , have come out fantastic , on this camera though , they come out horrible , so bad in fact that i 'm embarrassed to show people ! believe me , if i had n't gotten it free as a present i 'd be writing a nasty letter to sony , as it is though my next camera i 'm saving up for and buying from a brand that does nothing but photography equiptment , therefore knows what they 're doing . sony makes great tv 's and home entertainment systems , anything else i 've bought from them , or known someone who has , has been junk , their camera , their car stereos , their computers ! sony should stick to tv 's and home theater , it 's what they 're good at , camera 's not so much , unless you 're looking for something cheap that you 'd only use in the day , even then i 'd recommend a disposable , they even work better than this camera
camera	i have been using kodak cameras for years . this is my third kodak digital camera . it does everything , including taking excellent close-up wildlifephotos . it is as easy to use as a point and shoot . however , it does have all the bells and whistles needed for a professional style camera . it is well worth the money . look no further this is the camera for you
camera	i guess i really should n't complain because my husband won the camera in an office rally . but the pictures it takes are disgraceful for a samsung product every two to three pictures are blurred unrecognizably-where you ca n't even tell what you have taken . if you have found yourself among the fortunate few who actually found success with this camera thank your lucky stars . even if it is a less expensive choice versus the other cameras on the market today spend the extra money it would be worth it not to miss any family moments like my family did , on this useless piece of crap
camera	you wo n't go wrong with a panasonic dv . i 've had a few models . i have several of this model for my business . they 're rock solid reliable , nice and small for portability , and the quality of the recording is very goo
camera	this product is good for its price . the mini tripod inside the switchgrip looks very good and holds my canon pro perfectly . the travel bag is also very useful
camera	the worst thing for this is , you have to bring a bench of disc with you and replace disc every 20 min if you are capturing hd video . i think most of buyers would take hd video if you buy a hd camcorder . but a small disc can only hold 20 min hd video , have to change disc time by time . the cmos sensor is worse than ccd but it is the best sensor among cmos in this price today . a lot of noise will come in low light condition ! i bought it for $ 800 and return it . i think you 'd better buy sr1 with a 30g hard drive . that would be a much better one !
camera	i originally bought the edit 120 ( no detachable case ) but was looking for a separate bag in which to keep the cables that are not used often ( to leave at home ) . then i came across the edit 120+ with the detachable case which fit the bill exactly . not haven actually seen the detachable bag yet , i was somewhat concerned about the method/design of the atachment . it needed to be easy to remove , but it also needed to be secure ; the pictures i found on the internet did n't show how it was attached . i was relieved when i actually saw how it was attached . there is a slotted bottom on the main bag the entire length of the bag ( an open slot is at each end ) . the add-on bag has a wide semi-rigid flap that slides through the slotted bottom and a fold down tab on the free end that is secured by velcro . the attachment method is secure and is almost invisable , and the design compliments the aesthetics of the original bag . i think the original bag is very good , and the add-on detachable bag makes this a superb choice . unfortunately , you have to buy this as a combination . if you originally bought the 120 single bag version , it does n't have the slotted bottom on it and ca n't be retrofitted ( and i do n't think they sell the detachable bag separately )
camera	i bought this camera around the beginning of july and have used it several times already . i 've upgrade from a nikon coolpix 3200 to this one due to smaller , sleaker size and more megapixels . this camera takes excellent pictures , in broad daylight as well as in the dark . red eye reduction is wonderful , however the flash does go off about 4 or 5 times . it 's not broken ... it 's supposed to do that for everybody who thinks their camera has a glitch . overall , i think this was definitely a good buy and am looking forward to taking the camera on vacation !
camera	i was looking for a pair of roof-prism binoculars like this , for hawk and bird watching . i had looked at swarovskis , but they were way out of my budget , nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution . these binoculars are crystal-clear , with sharp focus . the 42mm lens lets in lots of light , lots more than the 35 's i 've been using . i wear glasses and the twist- up- and -down eyecups are a blessing . there are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm , nice because i always used to lose them . for the price , these ca n't be beat
camera	i owned this lens for about a year before upgrading to the image stabilized f/2.8 version . overall i was very happy with the f/4 lens and miss having it available because of the significantly lower weight . sharpness is amazing and comparable for both lenses , and the f/4 can provide plenty of background blur . if you are shooting mostly outdoors i would recommend the f/4 .
camera	took some nice pictures underwater in cuba . pretty easy to use . worked fine at our depth ( ~8 meters , 24 feet ) . still waiting for the chance to use it at greater depths .
camera	bought the camera on a recommendation , and also what looked like good specs on the web . owned it for less than two weeks when the lcd screen cracked ( below the surface of the protective cover ) . turns out this is a very common problem with these cameras . panasonic will not warranty fix this ! if you do get one , or own one , be very careful not to use the left nav button . if you do , be very careful on the pressure you apply . this is the camera 's glass jaw , and you might end up `` bricking '' a brand new camera . i am replacing mine with a canon
camera	product is hard to review because you sent me the wrong battery . as of 1/29/07 it has not been taken off my credit card . how would you rate my review
camera	the article that receipt is difrente to that of the photo that appears . the conector to the camera is not usb/fire wire , but it is a type nini stereo
camera	yes this is a very good first camcorder . i am a first time user of any cam corder . i have olny had mine for a month or so but i have made several films with it and it is very inersting . but the software is harder to use that movie maker . but if you are a first time buyer then i would go for this becasuse 20gb is engough to use.. but the battery life is short but u wont need to make a feature length film ! ! ! it is just fantastic . enjoy.. do
camera	i had been waiting 3 years for any manufacturer to market a camera similar in specification to the canon eos1 . as exploration health , safety environment advisor , work takes me to middle of the desert or the oceans . the wait was for 35mm film quality , with speed of picture taking ( 5 frames per second is barely enough to capture dolphins - hence the 8 + fps of the eos 1 was desired ) . there was a parallel wait for an image stabilised 28-300 zoom lens . let 's cut the story short . if i want a camera to bring on holiday , it would not be this one - the battery and charger are too heavy and bulky ; instead i would choose the eos20d without hesitation . but having hundreds of failed 35mm film frames i decided not to wait any longer but to buy the eos1d mark ii because the 1ds mark ii is not fast enough at 4 frames a second . with 35mm cameras , after a few seconds on the shooting , i would have to run back inside to the cabin ( of a ship ) to change film . if there is large enough memory card in the eos1dii , there is no need . this camera is built with seals against the environment ( and so does the 28-300mm lens ) . instead of being scared of running out of film , now it is easy to keep the shutter button pressed while panning ( and hoping ) the dolphins do their jumps into the air . with the 28-300mm lens attached , there is no need to change lenses either . dolphins riding the bow wave of the ship could be captured at 28mm while those further away could be caught with 300mm setting . it is a disappointment that the battery is not lion but the older nimh . but as with any photo gear requiring a battery it is wise to have a spare , whatever the substance . i just wish canon package a small travel size charger instead of the standard one which is very bulky . it has connections for two batteries ( yet it could only charge one following the other ) but most people would be happy using one battery while the other one is being charged . you just try to convince some airport officials to let you on the plane with the above kit , binoculars , laptop , mobile phone , gps ... ... .ext . hard disk ... .as hand luggage . for work , i am committed and therefore bear the weight and troubles of hauling the hardware . but for holidays , i would choose the eos20d with built-in flash because who would want to lug around 3 kilos all day plus flash gun and possibly a tripod ? the camera gets 4.5 stars but the battery and charger lets it down . why just 4.5 stars ? one of the beauties i had thought with digital slr was not having to do anything in processing , just transfer the images to the computer . wrong . the .jpg straight out of the camera is not sharp enough . post processing is required . why ? why is that necessary when the canon s60 ( which i use for different assignments ( with underwater housing ) ) does n't need to ? that defeats the point of having a .jpg file at 5.5 meg when the 1.5 meg of the s60 looks sharper straight out of the camera ? still , there is raw if the standard output is not suficient . incidentally , the eos1dsii also produces 5.5 meg .jpg and those also require post processing . for those of us who are not interested in working longer than necessary ( me ) 16.7 million pixels would seem a bit wasted . i am still waiting for the camera which produces sharp .jpg files in-camera without having to post process , and can shoot at 8+ fps with a sensor size equivalent to 35mm film . meantime i shall have to learn to shoot with raw files and post process . also incidentally , the sensor size of the eos20d is smaller , which means although itself is lighter than the eos1d series camera , having to carry around an extrawide lens is not my idea of fun on holiday . the magnification ratio for the eos1dii is 1.3 whereas the eos20d is 1.6 . this means i could still travel reasonably light ( compromise ) with the 1dii and 28-135mm is lens attached . sure it is possible to use stitching but that is more time spent at the computer and time is precious . any regrets ? none what-so-ever . it is state of the technology at the moment . another benefit of using digital is that , it does n't matter if you had been shooting iso 100 all day . come the night if you want to shoot the rig with a moon as backdrop , just change to iso 1600 without having to bother about `` pushing2 the film in developing . it 's a beauty when an is l lens is attached . you 'd need is when there is machinery vibrations and the ship is moving with the swell ! good job canon . now you need to shoe horn in a more capable cpu ( to process the images in-camera ) , fit the 1dsii sensor into this one or this motordrive into the 1dsii and you may persuade me to part with more cash .
camera	i bought this camera in february , and after taking 6 shots the camera almost died , i could review the photos i had taken , but when switched the dial to take photos the camera turned out black either the lcd/efv , and only turned off when i removed batteries , i sent it to fuji repair center , and got it back again almost one month later . then six months later the camera did exactly same thing , i have n't received my camera back yet , but i 'm sure never will buy a fuji camera again and of course my camera will died again in the next months after i get from the repair center and at the end of the day i will have wasted almost 500 dlls
camera	worked like a charm in my panasonic ag-dv30 video camera ! having 5+ hours of battery life really helps when you 're on vacation and do n't want to mess with charging batteries or being `` selective '' in your shooting . this gives you the freedom to tape what you want and edit out the boring stuff later . worth the money and a good deal here
camera	this scope is not a good starter scope for anyone interested in astronomy . here 's why : 1 . the objective is too small , only 60 mm , 2.36 inches , so it is too small to bring in the light necessary for even a beginning look at the universe . i suppose it is adequate for the moon , but that is it . the planets will appear as very small disks . one will be able to see saturn 's rings , but the image will be very small . forget it for deep sky objects , clusters , galaxies , etc . 2 . the mount is an altazimuth , which will not follow the celestial object in the sky . the earth is rotating , and anyone focusing on a star or moon will quickly find the object drifting out of the field of vision . a better mount is an equatorial mount which makes it much easier to track objects . 3 . the 4mm eyepiece is too powerful for this scope . the observer will find it hard to look through ( very small eye opening ) , and will in most cases cause blurred images . the 20 mm eyepiece is the only functional eyepiece . the barlow is a 3x , which again is too poweerful for this scope . 4 . the mount will vibrate when touched , which will cause the image in the eyepiece to `` shiver '' , which is very frustrating . even for the low price , do n't be enticed by this scope ; it has too many flaws . save your money for a larger scope with a better mount . jim `` konedog '' koenig , astronomy buf
camera	loved the concept of this camera ... small , 10x zoom and sleek looking , but the first one lasted 3 days , had it replaced and the second one lasted 1 week . both stopped operating completely . so given that kind of problem i do not recommend this camera
camera	in the never ending race for larger and larger megapixel counts , the d70s has fallen behind the pack . ( however , if that 's the only measure by which you 're judging a digital camera - you really should consider further research before plunking down several hundred dollars . ) nevertheless , it 's quite a good camera . what i like about it most : - it looks and feels solid . some of the reviewers that pan this camera for feeling flimsy and plasticky are apparently still stuck in the realm of pro cameras that cost several thousand dollars . it 's not a bulletproof titanium box that you can back a hummer over , but it certainly seems to outdo dslrs in it 's category . - very good battery life . - backwards compatibility with decade 's worth of nikon slr lenses . my gripes : - the latch that keeps the pop-up flash in place broke in less than a week . - inability to meter through older manual focus lenses . - lack of full functionality with flashes other than the sb-600 and sb-800 . - nikon 's raw software and control software are n't included with the camera , and are imho overpriced . ( ... and on top of that , nikon has split what used to be one overpriced software package into two overpriced software packages ... ) what would improve this camera the most : - iso 100 and iso 3200+ - ability to store multiple custom white balance presets , and then pull them up on the fly . - replacing the `` idiot modes '' ( i.e . `` portrait '' , `` landscape '' , etc . ) with modes that you could customize

camera	seems a little much to pay for an `` extension cord '' but upon receipt i see it is of very high quality and nice build on the connectors . plus , its a brand item from canon , so what can you do
camera	i bought a sony icd-mx20 digital voice recorder a week ago . i was surprised that sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named `` digital voice editor '' . sony customer service staff told me that if you lost the cd that came with the box , you had to buy a new one . only patches of the software are available to download . the customer service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device . this immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged . sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post-sales services . think twice before making your buying decision .
camera	i bought this camera owning 2 more digital cameras . one kodak and another canon ( a70 ) . amazing product ... pro ... almost everything.. cons ... no audio on video i definetly recommend the product for the price
camera	i ordered the sony dcr-dvd108 on april 9 . i still have n't received the camera . what i have received are 2 e-mails stating that the product is late without any sort explanation why . as far as i 'm concerned it is too late ! the first stated that the shipment would leave on april 16 . when i purchase the camera , i did so because the add stated that if i wanted the camera by april 12 , i needed to order it in the next 11 hours and 23 minutes . this i did . the next e-mail that arrived just this morning and i 've been informed that it will arrive between april 26 and may 3 . i have already missed recording one of my seven year old daughter 's gymnastics competitions and now if stick with their delivery dates , i 'll be missing 2 more . well , i 'm not missing 2 more and amazon is getting the camera back . the best part of this is that i do n't even have the option of canceling the order because amazon is and i quote , `` ... preparing these items for shipment and this portion of your order can not be canceled or changed . '' if you ca n't get the order out on time , you should respect your customer enough to offer cancellation of the shipment or better yet , try some real customer service and have the product shipped from a competitor at your cost . i can tell you with certainty that sort of customer service would bring your customers for life .
camera	i am 67 years old and started out in photography as a kid with a contact printer and a box camera . i have had all types of cameras over the years , mostly 35mm film canon slr 's . i too bought all sorts of these 5-7 mp point and shoot digital cameras before returning to my true love , slr 's . i have had my digital canon rebel xt about a month now and i ca n't keep my hands off of it . it lacks nothing . although the kit lense is good , i bought a 28-135 canon zoom lense with image stabilizion and have produced stunning photo 's with it . i love the way you can use the 7 points to focus , i mainly use only the center point with focus lock and never get an out of focus picture . i guess the nicest thing for me is that i now do n't have the urge to buy every point and shoot camera that is paraded out on qvc or hsn that has a `` wonderful '' new feature like `` low light or non-shake . '' this canon has every good feature in the known universe and you ca n't outgrow it . its a camera that will let you be as good as you can be , it wo n't hold you back . the battery life is great , the built in flash is good but i bought a 430ex and that 's even better . i never figure i 'm wasting money buying accessories for this camera as it will be my main squeeze for many years to come . i always missed my 35mm canon slr 's and now feel that i have an old friend back again , only much much better . believe me , you ca n't go wrong getting this camera , its beyond description ...
camera	i bought this item as a gift , and it ended up becoming mine . i have to say , i am greatly dissatisfied . here are some main issues i am having with the camera : 1 . it is very poorly designed . the look and the feel of the camera are not elegant . buttons are really ugly , and operating the camera is awkward , and for some functions requires both hands to operate.. 2 . the camera has been having issues with turning on and off occasionally . 3 . the worst , by far , is the picture quality . colors are just plain terrible . automatic settings are a disaster of photography . i have used a canon ( 2mp ) before getting this one ( 5mp ) . the canon was far superior in quality , colors , lighting.. i do n't need large files of trash , i am perfectly fine with smaller files with great pictures . as a result , i am strongly recommending getting a different camera . i have had great experiences with canon ; and seems like sony and nikon are doind a good job too . but hp must stop making cameras , and indeed many other devices .
camera	i purchased this lens to take photographs of vintage wristwatches . i use an original canon digital rebel and the shots are really very detailed . it is easy to use in fact , i can hand hold the camera and capture the details in the hand-made craftsmanship of the watches . its f2.5 opening is a welcome change when you are use to shooting with a zoom lens and it is quite sharp edge to edge . if you own a canon digital slr and want to pocket some extra coin then this is the lens for you .
camera	two months . . .the amount of time in which i saved to purchase what i thought was an 8 megapixel camera for a steal . . . one week . . .to find that no matter what i tried i was utterly dissapointed . . . 1 ) no matter the setting every picture is drowned out by the flash and withouth the flash the picture is nothing more than i horrible blur . 2 ) the 5 minute 2 time flash is horrible . . .every person i try to get a picture of thinks it has taken the picture before the final flash even goes off resulting in 90 % horrible family photos . i could go on but i wont . . .i cant even stress my dissapointment in my waste of money . . .there is a reason that it is not the bestselling camera on amazon . . .because it is not worth it . i now have to save up for another and hopefully pawn this off on someone with less expectancy in a camera
camera	i purchased this item two weeks ago . my thought was that it seemed like a reasonably priced , perfect addition to the `` tools '' necessary for a budding amateur backyard astronomy hobby ( its advertised contents , construction , and `` glow-in-the-dark '' planisphere ) . after closely examining the item for the past ten days , i 'm forced to conclude that i was in error , and that you really do get what you pay for . as celestron is one of the most reputable names in astronomy , i must confess that i assumed that quality would follow in all products that bear their name . i have found that this does not hold true in the case of these sky maps . the major problem with the package is that it is rife with misspellings , letter transpositions , apparent omitted words , and just plain ( what we used to call in the old days ) `` typographical errors . '' additionally , when i compare some of the technical information on the maps ( i.e. , star magnitudes , astronomical distances , etc . ) and accompanying descriptions with other authoritative astronomy sources i have in my possession , i also find numerous apparent errors and discrepances . when using a product like this , it is essential that one be able to trust the data and information it contains . since i 'm not able to do this , i must rate this item with one star . when i purchased the item , it was marked down by twenty percent . i note that in less that two weeks since my purchase , the price has been further reduced by another thirteen percent . in this case , do n't be fooled ( as i was ) by an attractive price . avoid this product . ( i do n't have a substitute to recommend at this time . )
camera	i am [ ... ] the unit because it will not run a slideshow from a media card . 16 mb of internal memory for a slideshow is just not enough ! read on ! if you call they will tell you that the slideshow from cards is not possible because on page 13 refers to excluding pictures from the slideshow on only on internal memory . this is not a definitive statement that slideshow is not possible from a card only that excluding individual pictures from a card is not possible . ( because the unit is not capable of writing to a media card . ) looking further on p13 it states : `` choosing slideshow frequency note : this function applies to photos stored on all media . '' page 27 in faq states : `` 2 ) q : can i switch between different slideshows photos by using different memory cards ? a : yes . when you connect your memory card to photoframe ( tm ) , it will slideshow photos stored on that specific card . '' finally , the quick start guide faq states : `` q can i switch between different slideshow photos by using different memory cards ? a yes , digital photo frame will slideshow photos stored in the card or camera currently connected . '' clearly the three references i provide indicate that the dpf can operate slideshows from a media card . in reality slideshows from media cards does not work . philips how about a firmware upgrade ? i bought this thing to allow my mother who is not computer savvy and lives far away to look at family pictures . i was planning on sending preloaded cards to her . all she would have to do is insert the card and turn it on . ( mom is 75 and this is as technical as she gets.. ) . do not buy this dpf for older , none computer savvy people . since media card can not be used , you have to use the internal memory for slideshows . the internal 16mb memory can hold about 70 pictures - that 's it . it is also unclear the maximum size a file can be . i believe the internal memory converts the file to a dpf friendly format and renames the file when copying from a media card . ( how is mom going to tell me which picture to print if the name changed ? ) why have media card slots if they are useless ? internal memory is way too small ! do not buy and save yourself the hassle .
camera	at 300mm this lens is very soft , it 's hard to get a shot that looks like it 's in focus . to do so , you need to shoot at about f/11 , and then since there is little light available , you usually have to bump the iso to 800 or 1600 just to get an acceptable shutter speed . of course , the high iso then introduces other artifacts . the focus is also dead slow and often does n't lock on . this is a lens that i have constantly fought with . do n't upgrade to the new 70-300 is either , as it 's only marginally better . buy the 70-200 f/4l . it 's a far superior lens
camera	in my opinion this is not a marketable product . the cameras features are irrelevant if it does not work . there is clearly a design fault and the product should be withdrawn from sale until there is a fix . when it did work it was a convenient pocketable unit . as for hd - possibly at high noon in the sahara , but in anything but perfect light the results are dissappointing .
camera	this cable came in a cheap packing and it does not have any logo on it so you ca n't say which company it belongs to . i have used a lot of sony products and i feel it is not up to the standard of sony . it works great had no problems so far . it is flexible kinds so you do n't have to worry about positioning your laptop according to your tv .
camera	like other reviewers , after careful research , i decided to purchase this product . it was affordable , received good reviews , and was of bigger size than others in the similar price range . when i received it in mail , i was quite happy : it worked great out of the box and it looked even nicer than what i had expected . the screen was bright and very attractive . the problems started about three weeks following the purchase . first , the slideshow option ( the kind with music ) stopped working . whenever i pushed the slideshow button , the screen would completely freeze and i had to restart the unit in order to use any other function . i thought , no big deal , i would just exchange the frame for another one . my second unit arrived yesterday . this one , however , started having problems right out of the box . after about 5 minutes into the slideshow , the screen started flickering , than shaking , became completely staticky and finally it re-started automatically . i played it two more times after that , each time with a similar thing happening 10 or 15 minutes into the slideshow . it is obvious this photoframe has a lot of potential ( big , bright screen ) ; unfortunately , the software is very buggy . i checked the portable usa website and it does not appear that they have any patches that could be downloaded as a fix . i will have to return this unit again , this time for a refund . my assumption is that this product has received many positive reviews because people like it after they initially open the box . however , i would be curious to learn if others have had a similar experience after several weeks or months of ownership
camera	small and compact . let me see everyting i wanted to
camera	i have owned this camera for ~6 months and have finally deciced to replace it . i bought this camera to replace another nikon coolpix that was stolen from my house . but this one does not have a view finder to begin with and is way more complicated to use . i have always liked nikon cameras but the s9 just does n't make it . i can not use it outside because i can not see the lcd screen . sorry nikon but you blew it on this camera ! ! so i replaced it with a canon powershot a710 . what a difference in ease of use and ... it has a view finder . also my 1g memory card from rhe nikon fots in the new canon .
camera	after a week of using this i find the motor noise that others talk about is nothing . mine is a refurbished model from tigerdirect , so maybe the motor was already fixed : - ) my mother in law has a camcorder that sounds like a blender . the zr 500 is ok in low light , but you can adjust the exposure manually to correct if it is n't to your liking . you can also adjust the focus too ! my friend who is a mini dv guru said that in this end of the consumer spectrum this camera is on par . i 've made two practice dvd 's ( with firewire , no problem at all ) with this camera and like what i see . for those of you that have bad motornoise : try your video software to edit the noise out . power director has that feature . i am happy with this product , but i would rather have a higher end model now that i have a bit more in my budget for a camcorder . a great camcorder for beginners !
camera	i bought a sony icd-mx20 digital voice recorder a week ago . i was surprised that sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named `` digital voice editor '' . sony customer service staff told me that if you lost the cd that came with the box , you had to buy a new one . only patches of the software are available to download . the customer service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device . this immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged . sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post-sales services . think twice before making your buying decision .
camera	sony continues to exhibit the highest quality in their product design and manufacturing process . this case is very slim , compact , well made , and has a very luxurious feel to it . it completely enhances the look and attractiveness of the sony camera it is designed to hold
camera	the camera is good . had it 1 week now . low light it works and produces fair results . bright light is much better . small and light weight . you must use the supplied docking station to transfer as ther is no usb port on camera . there is the dc in and tv out on camera ( as well as the docking station ... just no usb ... why ? ) 30gb hard drive is plenty ... maybe too much . if you fill this up you are looking at 8 dvd 's and hours of transfer . the software is weak and conflicts with roxio 7.5 . roxio became unusable . roxio stinks anyway . found a simple program to burn after this ... ashampoo . plan on getting adobe premier elements , too . amazon had the best deal ... 89 less 30 mail in rebate from adobe . much better then the software in box . my first cam as we now have a cute baby . easy to keep it rolling and have gigs to save .
camera	it is a great compact camera with a good zoom . i can now leave a larger lens on my nikon dx 70 and use this for closer shots . you do need to try different settings to make sure you get the color you want . i really like it for most general quick shots , carry it wth me most of the time
camera	this is my third digital camera , i bought it after my tot dunked my previous camera under water . i did a lot of research before i bought this and it was highly rated in consumer reports . after a few months of ok pictures ( the macro setting is not very good though ) the lens cover started sticking but i learned to live with it . i would manually open up the lens cover each time . then the lens cover got stuck in the open position and i was learning to live with that . but now the camera is almost completely dead . it will not power up properly and sometimes it beeps . i 'm not sure but i think i am out of the warranty period with this . i will not buy another canon camera . this camera was made too cheaply . i wish things were not made to break right away
camera	the camera fits perfectly . the case is very stylish . best of all , its pink
camera	after discovering that the makers of a great camera would only offer such an inferior case , i did some more looking . what i ended up with was a pelican case . for those not familiar with these cases stop by any camera/photo shop , and they most likely carry them . they come in many sizes and are simply an airtight , waterproof high impact plastic case with very snug fitting latches . the inside is solid soft foam that you pluck to fit what ever you want to store in the case . i purchased the 1300 for my finepix 3800 . the case easily holds the camera , battery charger , mini tripod , and 3 xd cards . they come in 4 or 5 colors , and can be used for almost anything you want to protect from damage
camera	this is a great camera . plenty of resolution . excellent shot speed . sturdy frame . the kit lense does n't do the camera justice . buy the body separate and add a better lense . on the bad side , i had a small glitch with the camera 's firmware soon after purchase and had to return it for a fix . it was two months before the camera was returned . sorry , canon ... you lose a star for that
camera	i purchased this camera in december 2005 to replace my 7 year old sony digital 8 camcorder . unfortunately , everything except size is inferior in the panasonic compared to the `` ancient '' sony . the color is not nearly as sharp , the low light capabilities are laughable and the battery lasts half as long . the sound quality was adequate if not watching playback on the camera itself . the camera 's highest volume setting is too low to use if you want to listen while loading video into your computer 's editing program . the panasonic does have a relatively convenient manual exposure feature many other minidv camcorders lack . this allows better light control when shooting in auditoriums with spotlights . it uses a toggle to control the exposure and , while it is not as easy as the external thumb wheel on the sony , it is adequate . unfortunately , it functions so poorly in low light it would n't provide adequate color in an auditorium . i thought the image stabilization would be a great feature but my video is much shakier with the panasonic than my old sony . maybe it 's because the camera is so small it 's hard to keep as stable as the larger sony . video editing on a pc is equally easy on the sony and panasonic but the panasonic 's poor user manual would make it very difficult for a novice to figure out and your picture quality will be much better with sony 's digital 8 . if you do n't have to record in minidv format or have a built in 3 megapixel still camera , i 'd recommend buying an inexpensive sony digital8 for about a third of the price of the gs250 . if you do have to have a minidv camera and you wo n't be shooting in bright sunlight , try another brand . this upper end 3ccd camcorder will now have a home on a closet shelf where it will stay unless i need a very small camera to chase action in a cross country race or similar event on a sunny day . otherwise , i 'll use the old sony so i can share the video i shoot without being embarrassed about the picture quality
camera	i have been searching reviews of the nikon coolpix s7c to make sure that it wasnt just me - and i am finding that indeed countless other reviewers are having the same problem , and many have taken it up with nikon only to be told 'sorry ' . in a nutshell , i am a professional photographer and have owned about a dozen digital cameras ranging from the early elph to nice new slr models . i purchased the nikon coolpix s7c for my wife , and it is by far the worst one i have owned for many reasons , but the chief problem is they have simply screwed up the way this camera does things automatically and the result is horrible pictures . the 'electronic vr ' is simply digital image sharpening , the iso adjustments in low light are terrible , and what i simply can not believe is how terrible the autofocus is . couple that with the design of this camera that makes it difficult to shoot steadily , and you literally end up getting more than 50 % blurry pictures
camera	this is a terrible product : 1 . the binoculars are very heavy and awkward to use . 2 . the pictures are extremely poor . 3 . the company offers poor service and packaged instructions are very brief and insufficient . w
camera	i wish i 'd bought this a loooong time ago ! it is so helpful , esp . with macro shots . highly recommend
camera	the battery is half the side of the battery came with the camera an last half the time , an number or not the same , an it , s not the same battery . do not buy any thing from them because lying about what they are selling
camera	i am very pleased with this camera . i especially like the light meter that tells you how many apertures you are away from the correct exposure . i am using this for my photo class and is easy to use
camera	have had an olympus 4.0m.for 4 years and been very happy with it . as a gift i got this canon and was very diappointed in the color quality and sharpness . shot about 600 pictures people were blurred , not crisp and dim even on a sunny day . had to return it.do n't bu
camera	if you 're looking for a high-quality telephoto zoom lens that is fast enough to use indoors , you may have found what you 're looking for . the 70-200/2.8 lens produces beautiful results that are overall on par with the 135/2 prime lens ( although not quite as sharp ) . the main downside to this lens is that it 's big and heavy . i do n't mind carrying it around my neck on the camera so much , but when you go to use if you have to put extra effort into keeping the lens from shaking in your hands due to the weight . and it 's not exactly the sort of lens that i would want to toss into my backpack , just due to the immense size . if you do n't mind spending an extra $ 500 , consider also the 70-200/2.8 is ( image stabilization ) version of this lens . it weighs even more , but the built in is unit should help compensate for shaky hands whilst using the lens
camera	though being a nikonist for years and knowing the possibilities of that camera i could never imagine the results and performance of this item , easy to handle , incredible small for the capacity and giving the same options to get the same quality of pictures than the d80.i have both
camera	when i first opened up the `` super quick charger '' i was a bit put off ... it 's small , it 's cheap looking ... compared to the old nicd charger i used to have it was very unimpressive . then i plugged it in . say what you will about this barebones solution , it works amazingly well . it charges the batteries quickly and the batteries last a really long time in between charges . it does exactly what i was looking for . if i could improve anything it would be to implement some sort of cover on the battery slots . while it 's not essential to the process by any means , it would look a lot better , and the batteries would be less prone to being jostled out of their positions in mid-charge by a curious cat .
camera	very easy to install ; great tool for easily downloading photos to computer and removing from camera ; would recommend to anybody
camera	i am extremely happy with this purchase ! i love the 10x zoom when taking pics of my kids
camera	i purchased this for my wife for valentine 's day . the installation went fine but i have two problems with the device . first , the software to do the picture transfers is awful . you can only select pictures on your computer to download - you ca n't see what photos are on the device in the software . in order to delete photos you have to do it manually from the device itself . i checked the webpage for updated software - no joy . the crop feature is nice ( and well used ) but otherwise i feel like i am looking at a windows 3.1 application . second , the image quality on the device is very poor . i did n't have very high expectations , but this was lower than i expected . reminds me of the picture/screen quality in the very first color cell phone screens , maybe a bit worse . you can make out the picture , but not much detail at all . the advice of cropping the photos to only show headshots is an excellent idea , it 's the only way to get a decent picture . overall , i 'm a little disapointed . but then , you get what you pay for..
camera	kodak v705 black : small , can carry in pocket . wide angle lens , great for group photos . fast start up time . video mode is easy , built in mic picks up all the sounds.camera can stitch 3 photos together-great for vistas . i am happy with this camera . bought another v705 in silver for my friend and she loves it.kodak makes easy to take photos . weak flash- try not to be more than 6-8 feet away-or use photoshop on photos
camera	the new nikon en-el3e battery is a slight update for the nikon en-el3 provided with earlier dslr models such as the d70 . it adds a contact that allows new cameras to determine how much charge is left in the battery . the battery is grey to distinguish it from the black en-el3 . the en-el3e is backwards compatible with the en-el3 : you can put it in your d70 or d50 . the reverse is not true . the number of pictures that the battery gives you depends on a lot of factors , including shooting style , lcd usage , and of course , camera . ( the 2.5 '' lcd on the d200 will use up the battery much quicker than the smaller d70 . ) it is sufficient for a day of shooting . unless you are using a d200 in some professional capacity , in which case , you 'll probably be investing in at least one backup battery
camera	i agree with m. arse with the 2star rating . i was disappointed with this camera from the beginning . not a user friendly one and the pictures turn out very grainy with bad color quality unless you are in an optimum light . i 'm interested in the 7 mp camera canon offers . i 've read that it has much better shutter speed . recommended ? ?
camera	i purchased this camera case for my granddaughter for christmas to go with the camera her parents had bought for her . this is the first time i have ever been disappointed with a product i purchased from amazon . it was , in my opinion , not worth the price i paid ! the picture looked much larger that it actually was . i wil continue to purchase through amazon but i will be much more careful and definitely return it if i 'm not satisfied . in this case i did not have time to find another camera case . thanks for giving me the opportunity of expressing my opinion . linda sutto
camera	i would like to add to the reviews already posted , especially for anyone considering this lens as an alternative to the 80-400 vr . this is one of the only times i can remember when i have had the money to buy a nikon lens , but have not been able to bring myself to do it . the 80-400 is 6 years old , uses ancient mechanical ( slow ) focus , and has yet to be updated with vrii technology . all that , and it still costs more than the pro-quality canon 100-400 is , which has canon 's af-s equivalent too ! that said , i like long yet portable lenses , and after giving myself fits decided to `` settle '' for the 70-300 because it has vrii and af-s . if you are in the same boat then buy this lens , it is a gem for its intended purpose . i get sharp results wide open at 300 , and the light weight more than offsets the slower apertures . i would have loved this lens if it was an f/3.5 , but even at 4.5-5.6 i have really been surprised at the results . save the $ 1000+ until nikon updates the 80-400 dinosaur
camera	i will start off by saying , i loved my sony cybershot . when the alpha came out i could n't wait to get one . it died after 200 pictures on day three of a three week once in a life time trip through south america . amazon said it was out of their hands because it must be returned within 30 days . i 've spent 3 hours so far dealing with sony . most people i spoke to or on-line live chat support were unfamiliar with the product and transferred me around to business support , computers , video . they also contradicted one another . when i did get to someone who knew the product i was told firmly that despite the camera being a lemon and malfunctioning after only taking 200 pictures they the would only 'repair it ' not replace it . now i am stuck with a lemon , and i fear i have a history of further disappointment and frustration with this camera . i highly recommend you read all the customer reviews . other people have had problems with the camera , i ignored them because i had faith in sony and thought the other alpha owners ' dud cameras were unusual . if you decide to purchase anyway , i highly recommend you do not buy through amazon , but through a real store with a good and fair return policy , that stands behine their products . places like microcenter will exhange , no questions ask . i am kicking myself because amazon was $ 100 cheaper then microcenter . penny wise pound foolish . i love amazon , but , i will never buy anything other than books and dvds from them . lesson learned on electronics .
camera	this is something you will really need to keep you camcorder save and sound . defenitely worth the money
camera	i bought this camera for myself at christmas . it is my first digital camera purchase . i love the clarity of the pics . i love the shutter speed ! i do wish the lens cap would stay on better , but that is so minor compared to my likes of the camera .
camera	nice looking . good quality . but the case has two large flaps on the sides which make it difficult to put the camera in and out .
camera	i received this as a gift and at first i thought it was great , but then i realized it would only display 142 images . i worked with technical support for several months ( they are not the speediest or most helpful ) . i resized , renamed , restructured the photos , tried them on different media and finally they admitted it was a bug . i rma 'd the unit at my shipping expense of course , only to recieve another with the same problem . i would n't recommend this purchase
camera	i 've had other 3 digital cameras and this is the best i think , i shots very quick , flash is brighty , and even soft flash for more natural shots . can browse pictures very fast and is has a lot of posibilities to edit inside the camera , is light tiny and slim . one of the best cameras . i do n't find a negative feature on it . i love it
camera	pictures do not come out very good . poor quality ! i would not recommend it
camera	for $ 14.00 , you should get this sleek little package to protect your camera and battery/accessories . if you 've ever accidentally dropped an expensive camera , you know just what i 'm talking about . it 's nice looking as well
camera	be careful ordering this item - make sure it 's the right one for your camera . while it says it 's for the a95 , it is n't . while it does n't say in the header that it 's the la-dc52c , it is , and the a95 camera requires the la-dc52d . i had to return the wrong one and reorder the right one . i purchased the wrong one based on amazon 's direction when purchasing accessories and do n't want others to make the same mistake
camera	i am starting my career as a professional photographer , and i have n't had any problems with these filters . they come in a nice case , and are easy to attach to my lenses .
camera	reasons to buy it : 1 . cheap , a mere $ 140 . 2 . packed with features . from complete auto mode ( point and shoot ) to fully manual mode . 4mp and 3x optical zoom good enough for most situations . 3 . picture quality is good . it 's better than the other two cameras i own ( olympus c720 uz and sony dsc s600 ) . 4 . compact . it 's smaller than it looks in the stock photo . 5 . fast . switches on and is ready for the first shot within about 1.5 seconds . other things i liked about the camera : - good ergonomics . fits nicely in my hand , all the buttons are well placed and easy to access . i can even switch on the camera and take pictures with one hand . - powerful flash . enough to fill up a moderate size room . - great video mode with sound . it also comes with an audio video cable so that you can connect the camera to your tv and watch the vidoes and pictures on your tv . - lcd is decent size and is fairly bright , which means it 's even visible outdoors in the daytime . things i did n't like about the camera : - manual could be more detailed . there is a bsaic manual and sort of a quick start guide . but there was no 40 page booklet which explained each and every feature in detail . - the auto focus illuminator ( for help in focussing in low light ) is a little bright and can be annoying sometimes . but the upside is that you get good focus even in really low light conditions . - does not come with a battery charger . i bought rechargeable batteries and a charger separately . i have owned the olympus c720 uz and the newer sony dsc s600 , but i think this camera is better than both of them .
camera	if you are looking for a good small camera , and have no intentions of being ansel adams , this is a good camera choice . i travel alot , and this camera is perfect because it can fit in my pockets or a small purse . it also takes pretty good pictures
camera	i purchased this camera case for my granddaughter for christmas to go with the camera her parents had bought for her . this is the first time i have ever been disappointed with a product i purchased from amazon . it was , in my opinion , not worth the price i paid ! the picture looked much larger that it actually was . i wil continue to purchase through amazon but i will be much more careful and definitely return it if i 'm not satisfied . in this case i did not have time to find another camera case . thanks for giving me the opportunity of expressing my opinion . linda sutto
camera	when i received the camera i thought of giving it a 5 star because the good looking and nice picture . after 6 months use , i wish i could give it a 0 star . it 's true it looks good but it 's very hard to hold the camera . it droped twice when i took pictures . also the lens is too small . the dirt is very easy to get onto the lens and very hard to clean b/c it 's small . thanks the dirty lens , the picture quality is worse than ever . the battery is very small too . after 6 months use , it can not hold enought power to shoot 10 pictures ! they have to put the buttons here and there to fit the small space . it 's not a user friendly camera .
camera	i own several canon lens for my 20d and this is hands down the best . i had a 28-135 which was a very good lens regardless of some reviews , and i got many excellent photos with it - this is distinctly better in all ways . ( of course , it costs a lot more ) . recently went with the grandchildred to sea world and i got 100 % good photos , with several really outstanding ones . it is light , accurate and has is - what more do you want ? you can replace a slew of lens with this one and perhaps selling the old ones will help pay for it . bought it as soon as it was available and have not regretted it one moment . if you have one lens , this is the one
camera	i am on my third off-camera cord ( about one per year ) . two have broken . as other reviewers noted , the four screws under the metal retaining clip on the `` female '' end of the cord loosen and eventually fail . i have found that a thin narrow knife can be used to remove the black `` spring '' cover over the screws on the shoe . you can then tighten the screws with a screwdriver . if you use locktite on the screws then they will not loosen . canon should do this at the factory . i use this cord with a stroboframe `` portrait/landscape '' grip which raises the flash over the camera by six inches thus eliminating red eye and providing a much more pleasing light . the stroboframe grip comes with the right size threaded screw for this cord . when my cords failed i lost the extended-through the lens metering just like another reviewer noted . i am not a professional photographer and only use the camera occasionally yet the cord still fails . canon should re-engineer this cord to make it more durable . unfortunately , i do not believe that there are alternative cords . it looks like i will need to keep buying canon cords
camera	image quality is pathetic . it generates ludicrous amounts of noise even at the lowest iso ( 80 ) . rest assured , you will be disappointed . i returned mine within a day
camera	i had an olympus stylus 4mp and loved it but wanted a newer model . i purchased this 710 and love it . olympus makes it so easy to take pictures with pre-set options and image stabilization . i love the smaller size of this camera and it was easy to use . there is no way to give it 4 1/2 stars so i gave it 5 but there is one thing i do n't like about the area for the usb plug in . you have to pop off this cap ( it hangs off the camera ) and maneuver the small end of the cable in the camera ( tight fit with the cap hanging there ) then pop the cap back on..it just seems flimsy and i wonder if that cap will eventually break off . in the 410 it was much easier to access this as it was near the memory card . that is the only design feature i do n't care for on the 710 . it is a great camera and i am very happy with the purchase .
camera	i no longer own my previous and much finer camcorder , so i finally found myself in the market for purchasing some kind of camcorder until i could get back on my feet to get another good one . i thought this one may do , good price , looks sharp , purchased on impulse . . .big no-no . i will say the camera takes decent pictures ( as the previous reviews state , almost exclusively outside in broad daylight or indoors with very good lighting ) . other than that , do n't bother . the mp3 is a cute function ( and quite possibly the most practical ) . the video , uhh , let 's not even go there . the voice recorder , also not bad - records in wav format and can be transferred to pc . jack of all trades , master of none . . .i guess that would be the best way to finally describe this item . i will say that i 'll be saving up now for much better camcorder and no more `` i just got ta have this right now '' save your $ , find a quality product - even if you have to pay a little more for it . trust me , it will be overall better in the long run . .
camera	i have an olympus fe 100 camera and the battery did not fit ! my niece has an olympus fe 140 camera and the battery did not fit in hers either ! the company does not accept returns on batteries that are opened so i was just out of luck
camera	seems panasonic has finally dropped the hammer on the pseudo dslr market , with 420mm at 12x or 749mm - 21.4x at 3mp is outstanding especially with ois . excellent pictures out of the box , menu operations are plentiful , nr can be reduced and the jog dials front and back for aperture or shutter is very professional . leica lens is crisp and sharp , i shoot in aperture priority with nr at minimal and the pictures even in jpeg look like they have been post processed , simply amazing . after experiencing this camera i sold my nikon d80 , attachment lens and soft pictures nikon was giving me is unacceptable , i went thru every menu option including using the much hyped rgb3 which by the way gives cartoon colors has no comparison to the panasonic . high speed usb is my only complaint for data transfers , noise reduction for higher iso noise is a bit over powering but acceptable but controllable at your liking , a 3 '' , screen would be nice but maybe on the next model . btw , moon shots with the raynox 2020 at 3mp give a zoom of 47.08x optical or 1647 mm optical , hand held shots with ois ( image stabilization ) enabled gives jaw dropping pictures , you actually have a telescope with ois at your reach , simply amazing . 100 % satisfied .
camera	i bought this camera for my 4yr old granddaughter who can handle my digital camera quite well and found it to be a total waste . the camera was much smaller than expected , trying to figure out what mode you 're in is ridiculous and the display is quite difficult to see let alone interpret . nothing is a simple `` one step '' procedure which you would expect for an item geared towards children . i was so frustrated setting it up that i did n't bother giving it to her . the software installed okay but was also far from `` kid friendly '' . i wish i would 've found and read these user opinions before making the purchase . ironically , the reviews i did see made it out to be better than the other cameras on the market for kids . i believe you 'd be better off purchasing a `` regular '' inexpensive digital camera for your potential `` shutterbugs '' .
camera	at least for now it is : - ) . during the course of the past 10-12 months i have owned 7 , that 's seven , digital cameras : canon s230 ; kodak v530 ; 5 different models of casio 's : z60 , z600 , z850 , p700 ; and most recently presented my wife with a red s770 for valentine 's day . i also had a pretty good chance to evaluate canon sd450 ( my brother-in-law owns one - it was actually a gift from my wife and i to him for his 21st birthday ) , casio ex-s600 ( a good friend of mine owns one ) , and panasonic dmc-tz1 ( once again , a gift from my wife and i to my father-in-law for his last birthday ) . if you read any of my digital camera reviews ( and i 've written a few by now ) , then you know that i 'm not particularly fond of canon 's lately - i think they are overrated and overpriced for what they have to offer . as i also mentioned before , i 've tried several different kodak models ( and i used to work for the company too ! ) , but all of them turned out to be a waste of my time , to say the least . i became a big fan of casio 's , although not all of my experiences with them were great . but being a huge gadget `` freak '' that i am , and constantly wanting new `` toys '' , i have always craved for more . over time , my tastes in digital cameras have changed from having a simple point and shoot type of camera to wishing for more power and manual control . so one by one , i returned/sold all of my cameras , and after extensive ( and i really do mean extensive ) research , i got myself an lx2 . i must say though that i probably would n't have without getting to know my father-in-law 's tz1 first . i was actually quite impressed with it . powerful zoom , sharp lens , decent picture quality . i also played with some other panasonic models in various stores just to get a better feel for them , as well as spent a few hours on the phone , and exchanged numerous e-mails with a friend of mine who owns an fz30 , and who swears by it . unfortunately , lx2 was not available anywhere locally , but i felt that i got a pretty good understanding of what panasonic 's cameras are all about , and after some more thought and consideration , i went ahead and bought it from amazon ( nice thing about buying from amazon is that you can always return whatever it is you bought , including digital cameras , within 30 days for a full refund , no questions asked ) . i did know about the `` noise '' issue at high iso 's , but it was n't a decisive factor for me , and i 'm glad i did n't pay much attention to it and got the camera anyway . it turned out to be one of the best purchases i 've made in a long while . here is why : pros : - superb design . this camera is wonderfully crafted . and i absolutely love black ! it gives the camera a nice , clean , professional look . i do n't think i 'll be buying another silver camera soon after having this one ; - intuitive controls , and menus . i charged the battery , put it into the camera , and started using it and taking pictures right away , without even going through the manual once ; - a load of features , including a large , bright , widescreen lcd ; wide angle , super sharp leica lens with a 4x zoom ; mega ois - optical image stabilization control ( optical means it 's done mechanically , which is a true way of doing stabilizing , comparing to other cameras where it 's done by `` tricking '' the camera into using higher iso 's ) ; and many more . in addition , it has a joystick for an easy access to different menus , has a number of manual controls , as well as provides ability to shoot in raw format ( more on that later ) ; - it comes with silkypix developer studio software for working with camera raw files . for someone who is not familiar with raw - it 's a `` pure '' , camera specific picture format . it varies upon a manufacturer , meaning that canon raw is different from nikon or panasonic raw , for example . and it 's `` pure '' in a sense that it 's of a much better quality than a standard jpeg ( jpg ) , and does n't suffer from loss of information , such as white balance , or brightness . there is a lot more to raw than that , and i 'm not going to go into details right now . what i want to say , however , is that having previously owned a camera which supported raw format ( casio ex-p700 ) , i must have tried about a dozen of different raw editing software packages , including products from adobe , ulead , arcsoft , photofiltre , picture window pro , acdsee , lightzone , image broadway , and more . silkypix delivered by far the best results of all . the only one that i would probably put next to it is bibble ; - noise - what noise ? ! i really hate it when i hear people complaining about noise in this camera ( after having it tried myself ) , or any other compact digital camera for that matter . are you really that naïve that you think that you will get absolutely no noise in your images using a compact digital camera ? think again . you might have noticed that i 've used the word `` compact '' several times here . i 've done it on purpose - it is inevitable for a compact digital camera to produce some noise . some cameras are better than others , but no matter how hard you try , you will see some . this camera is no better or worse than any other one that i 've had/tried . at higher iso 's ( above 400 ) , it 's slightly more visible , but who in the right state of mind is using anything over iso 200 on a compact digital camera , such as this one , anyway ? i always have mine set to a 100 . if i feel that it does n't get the job done , i shoot in raw ; - picture quality is very good . yes , it does take some time getting used to , but once you familiarize yourself with everything this camera is capable of , you can achieve spectacular results , especially if you do n't mind doing some post processing . as much as i like everything this camera has to offer , there are , however , some things that kind of irritate me . here is a short list of bad things about this camera , otherwise known as cons : - first of all , this camera has actually been somewhat misrepresented . it 's been advertised as a 10.2 megapixel camera , which is not entirely true . 10.2 mp resolution is available only in 16:9 ( wide ) aspect ratio . two more ratios are available - 3:2 , and a more conventional 4:3 , but those offer 8.5 , and 7.5 mp resolutions respectively . so if you compare this camera to others that do n't have a widescreen format , or if you prefer to shoot only in a regular 4:3 mode , then this camera should only be referred to as a 7 mp digital camera ( because not all the pixels are actually effective ) . obviously , panasonic is aware of it , and marketed it having higher pixel count on purpose , to boost consumer 's interest ; - i expected to see a compact digital camera . what i got instead was actually a smaller compact camera than i expected . i was really surprised to see how small , yet convenient to hold and operate , the camera body was . what i did n't like , however , was the lens . not the lens itself , it 's actually quite superb , but the fact that it sticks out . i like cameras with lenses that retract all the way back to the camera body . i realize that it would probably loose some features , like the wide angle , and perhaps zoom , but i still wish it did that . it would be so much more ... umm ... compact ? ! the way it actually is makes it quite difficult to find the right case for it . almost impossible , i should say . i 've tried a few , but they are either too small or too big . i just ca n't find one that would fit right . i put an order for an slx1b case for it , which is specifically designed to fit lx1 , and lx2 models , but i hear they are not that good . we shall see ; - i 'm not a big fan of a pop-up flash . i always keep forgetting to open it when i need to use it . and it also seems a bit flimsy . i 'm treating it as carefully as i can , but i just ca n't stop thinking that it might break soon ; - i hate the lens cap ! ! ! there , i said it . it 's probably just one of those small annoyances that keep frustrating you until you get used to it , but for now i 'm not really happy with it . summary : despite very few minor negatives , i think lx2 is probably one of the best , most innovative cameras on the market today , and i sure am glad to have one . it offers more than any other camera in the same price range , and can even compete with some dslr 's when it comes to picture quality . if you are someone like me , who wants to have more control and/or learn more about digital photography , or a dslr user who just needs a solid backup to carry everywhere , then this camera is not be overlooked ! highly recommended
camera	probably would buy other camera if i could do over this one takes along time to gechage after flash . it is very touchy and you get alot of blurred pictures . you have to learn how to be very steady with it
camera	i purchased this lens back in march of 2005 to shoot static `` warhammer models '' with my 10d . i found that longer lenses such as the sigma 105mm , the canon ef 100mm , and the tamron sp autofocus 90mm all were `` too long '' with the 10d 's 1.6 focal crop and would result in requiring me to use a lot more physical space that what i had room for to get the shot . the canon ef 50mm f/2.5 is nearly a perfect match with the 10d for this purpose . its small , its compact , and its short focal length do not require that i be standing three feet away from the model i 'm shooting . as far as shooting at non-static objects , such as insects , the lens is slow to focus and loud , in both noise and vibration , which results in `` startled '' subjects and missed shots . the same also applies for non-macro shots as well . its slow focus makes it a poor choice for action photography , and its loud enough to draw attention to you when you are attempting other shots as well
camera	i have owned numerous celestron telescopes up to 11-inch apertures , so i expected better . i ordered this for my daughter - it arrived defective ; the primary mirror had slipped from its bracket , making collimation impossible . in celestron 's defense , it likely happened in transit . amazon 's return policy is not a hassle , and i 'm upgrading her to another telescope . i 'm sure that had this particular scope not arrived in a defective condition it would have made a great scope . only criticism is the plugs on the back to cover the collimation screws pop out a bit too easily
camera	i recently bought a new celestron nexstar 4se telescope and this eyepiece accessory kit . much to my disappointment , the eyepieces in this kit did not fit very well into the eyepiece holder of the telescope , and when cold ( nights in colorado are 25-45f ) , the eyepieces did not fit at all . celestron customer service was horrible and did not pay attention to my problem and did not follow up by email as promised . when i called a second time , they had no clue about the construction of the eyepieces and no thoughts about how to fix this problem . amazon replaced the kit ( thank you amazon ! ) , but the replacements did not fit either . i 'm returning that kit too . i finally bought a kit from meade ( 3 eyepieces and a moon filter ) that fit properly and are very easy to use . to be fair , if these eyepieces fit your telescope then they are a tremendous value ( hence the rating of 2 stars rather than 1 ) . the meade kit is a worse value , but because they work in my nice new scope , they are the best for anyone using a nexstar 4se
camera	the black of this is the same as on my camera , and with all the parts together , this is one professional looking set up ! i am not sure if this hood cuts down on glare/reflection , as i have not used it on a sunny day , but i do n't see why it should n't . and as cheap as this little product is , it is pretty much a must have with this camera ! ( s3 is ) one last side note , should you alreay own a extra lens or two . and they happen to be metal , be very carful about screwing them into this plastic adaptor ! i made that mistake and had to put the whole thing in the fridge for an hour , so the metal would shrink , and i could get the pieces apart
camera	my hunting buddy purchased a nikon 800 . my intent was to put him in the shade . that nikon kicks the crap out of my bushnell yardage pro 1000 . tried new batteries , tried bluffing , even tried to lie but nothing helped this product past 500/600 yards . my opinion is this product is not worth the postage . anyone with similar opinion or someone that has had a good experience with this product .

camera	this lens has extremely fast ( and quiet ) focus , and is razor sharp . what more could you want , when photographing wildlife up close

camera	this is a 1.2 volt battery charger . useless for anything that requires aaa 1.5 volt batteries
camera	before that it was kind of nice , but it can not focus in even semi-low light . it is definitely light and easy to take everywhere , but there are so many conditions where the results are disappointing . no way i would call the output hd quality , just the best sd ever with a 16 * 9 format . and then it broke
camera	this camera/mp3/camcorder/webcam/voice recorder is way to good to be true ! i brought one because it was cute and looked perfect for mini movies . but i was sadly mistaken ... this camera just takes cheap pictures and videos . the only thing that actully worked properly was the voice recorder that i had no need for . after about 3 days of trying to make it work a little better i gave up and sold it on ebay for the same price as i brought it for . it 's a great idea ... but it just is n't a good camera but if you want a voice recorder this is pretty nice . the mp3 player is n't all that wonderful either . it does n't work with itunes . or easy work with windows . hope this helps ... i wish i would have read this before i brought this camera
camera	i bought this camera after owning an olympus digital camera for years . i was extremely happy with my olympus , but wanted something smaller that would fit in my purse or diaper bag since i 'm expecting . this camera was such a disappointment . just about every single picture i took had huge white blobs all over it . ( this only happened when using the flash . i must admit the camera takes great pictures in broad daylight without the flash . ) plus , if you used the zoom at all , the pictures came out fuzzy . the first digital camera i ever owned ( 7 years ago ) took better pictures ! the store i bought the camera from would n't take it back because i waited two days past the 14-day return policy . so , i sold the camera and took a $ 100 loss . i 'd much rather lose $ [ ... ] than keep this camera
camera	i bought this rangefinder for golf . it is small enough that i could keep it in my pocket . it really helps me with the approach shots to the greens . it takes a bit of experience to be able to focus on the flag . i usually use a person on the green as my target . after i got an approximate read , i use the scan mode to find the exact distance to the flag . be careful with the tiny battery cover . it came loose and i lost it on the golf course . fortunately , i recovered it amongst the green grass . the cover is also green . i now put a tape over it to secure the cover .
camera	i received the xacti a few weeks ago and it 's performing like i hoped it would . the controls are a very simple and intuitive . all the required hardware is included . does not require any additional software to run on mac or windows . i have a macbook with boot camp running windows xp pro . the camera works easily with either platform . it is recognized as another drive and does not require any additional software to download the images and movies onto the hardrive . i am using a sandisk 2gb sd memory card . another big plus is not having to wait while downloading real-time like you would have to with minidv . the quality may not be the same as minidv but the convenience and ease of use make up for the difference . the quality is much better than a digital camera when taking movies and people will think it 's just a camera by it 's small size . my old camera was a 2 mega pixel canon powershot a60 . this is rated at 6 mega pixel . you can definitely see the difference in the pictures and movies . when filming movies , the higher frames per second sample rate makes the images smooth , even when taking pictures of high speed objects like helicopter rotor blades and airplane propellers . this is my first camcorder so i ca n't really compare to anything else ( except my old camera ) but the ease of use will make you want to use it all the time and people will start to tell you to put that thing away
camera	this is an awesome little camera . except that you ca n't use it at night ! there are horrible white spots in nighttime photos when the flash is used . apparently these appear because the flash is so close to the lens in this camera , and so dust reflects badly . it 's a known problem [ ... ] also , it 's totally annoying that sony uses all their proprietary technology . as a result , the cable for connecting this camera to the computer is unwieldly ( uhh , have you heard of usb ? ? ! ! ) , and you have to buy a sony memory stick , which probably wo n't work with anything else you have . on the flipside , you can take movies that are n't limited to 30 seconds with this guy - i think that might be a result of the memory stick technology . but other than that , the design and operation of this little guy seems pretty slick . the lens is not one of those that pops out , so not sure if that affects image quality at all , but as far as i could tell , quality was good . in the end , what good is a camera that ca n't take usable pictures with its flash ? ?
camera	amazon is selling this at nearly 50 % off ! the eyepieces are great for a beginner and the great case has room for more when you add them . the filters are really cool .
camera	when it comes to buying camcorders , i personally like the one with the build in memory . but after using this camcorder i was forced to change my mind . unlike other sony camcorders , first of all , it offers upto 40x zoom which is a lot . its a good use of your money . you can have it for under $ 400 and still works better than a lot of choices out there . easy to use , touch screen , takes still photos , has a good speaker so it 's easier to record video and voice , fits into your palm so to speak , and if you use rewritable mini dvds , you would n't have to worry about go out of memory . so when it comes to sony camcorders , i would say the better quality of this one would get the job done properly .
camera	i would spend a little more money and buy a better quality camera . the picture quality was not good at all . i previously owned another kodak camera with the same megapixels and the picture quality on that camera was much better . just after a year of using the kodak c300 camera , it stopped working and i did not use it that much . i now own the sony cybershot dsc-w50 that takes great pictures , i have n't had any problems with it and i have been using it on an almost daily basis since may 2006
camera	canon 's 28-135mm with is ( image stabilizer ) is a far better choice for the money
camera	this diffuser is the same quality as the one that comes with the nikon sb 800 flash . it is much better than other aftermarket diffusers that require velcro . this is made to fit the sb 600 perfectly . it snaps on and off easily . angled at 75 degrees it provides excellent fill . i use it on the sb 600 set up as a slave with the sb 800 for fill and back lighting . it should have been included by nikon as original equipment but is inexpensive and cost effective . much better than the built in plastic flat diffuser
camera	i have one and panasonic does n't have driver or processing downloads for it or even respond to requests . the proprietary video format requires special handling in your pc and can leave you with a camera full of useless clips . are they abandoning this product ? look on the panasonic website and see for yourself
camera	unfortunately i received the items damaged . the exterior postage box was unharmed but the paper boxes were obviously dropped at some point before packaging .
camera	i bought the 250d lens to use with my sony dsc-f717 and it is just wonderful . i can also use it with my canon g3 because i bought a canon ladc58b conversion lens adapter ( which is required and is inexpensive ) . i had been hearing a lot of good things about this lens in digital photography forums and i have seen many wonderful examples of its use . i recommend this lens to anyone who wants to make their `` macro '' photography shine . get one ! just be clear that there is the 52mm and the 58mm and do n't be confused as to which one will fit your camera . edit : just a clarification : this one 'is ' the `` 58mm '' even though above ( on this page ) when you click the links `` see more technical details '' and `` see all product description '' it mentions `` 52mm '' . this is misleading and confusing . at the very very top of this page it says `` 58mm '' . let me just assure you that this particular one 'is ' the `` 58mm '' and 'is not ' the `` 52mm '' . late edit ( aug 04 , 06 ) : well , it looks as if amazon finally corrected that misleading info i mentioned just above in my clarification
camera	this unit would be beautiful except for the fact that the input power plug and the on/off switch has a serious design flaw . i received the unit and it worked one time upon the first plug in of power . after that it became intermittent for about two or three switches off and on . it then failed completely and would not work at at all . i returned it and ordered another identical unit and it worked only one cycle on and would not come on at all after that . on both units the mp3 player continued to work . there is definately a serious problem with the power input receptical and/or the on/off switch . but for this problem it would be a wonderful unit
camera	i purchased this at a photographic store because a professional said you should n't go higher than 1.4x . just keep in mind -- 1.4x is only `` 40 % better '' . it worked really well , but did n't increase the zoomage enough . i decided to go with a 2x ( that 's twice the zoomage ) teleconverter by kenko instead . i gave this one to my brother-in-law for christmas . you have to think about what you want -- i want to get in really close to the birds . i have a 70-300mm zoom lens and 1.4x takes it to 98-420mm . it is an improvement , but not nearly enough ! if you want to get twice as close , this is n't going to do it for you . if you want to get half-again-as close , this almost gets you there . as far as quality , the quality is definitely there . five stars for quality , 3 for insufficient zoomage
camera	this was my first digital camera , and after reading everything i could get my hands on to read about digital cameras i chose this one . it so happens that the last 35mm camera i owned for years was also an olympus
camera	ok , this camera was inexpensive so i bought it for my kid for christmas ( 2005 ) . it actually took better pictures than my other camera ( other model sony cyber-shot ) , so i did n't give it to my kid , i kept it . i bought it a few weeks before christmas , it was opened and used on christmas day . i just used it days ago , and it just did the thing where it starts turning on , then immediately shuts off . it has been less than 1 year of use , but a week over 1 year from purchase . sony wants to charge me $ 111 and change , to fix it ( the camera was less than that when i bought it ) . i was just using the camera and it just shut off ! i searched inet to find many other people experience same issue . this camera is disposable ! ! ! ! i took my extra 256mb chip out of it to put in my other sony camera , and my wife said you ca n't see the screen ( lcd screen ) and you could n't for a long time . the other camera has the same issue many other people complain of as well . i also have 2 different model sony dvd writers for computer which are malfunctioning , and a sony vega 36 '' tv which is n't worth the money . i will never buy another sony product again !
camera	this lens is fairly inexpensive and the reason for that is while it definitely lets you get really close and the image is definitely larger than without it , the fact is the fz7 and the fz30 macro settings are already so good that the image is perhaps 15 % or so bigger than without it . if i can i 'll post a couple flower images to permit comparison with and without the lens . the camera i have is a fz7 . because i want as large an image as possible of my focus i am very happy
camera	rated one star for the lack of value . you can buy the same canon brand case for under $ 14 and a higher capacity , imho better , albeit non name brand , 1200mah battery for under $ 10 from amazon . the neck strap is not worth the difference .
camera	considering the price this camera works great , i use it for taking family pics and is wonderful . what i dont like is the lack of zoom great product anyway
camera	the 5x7 digital photo frame from pacific digital is very cheaply made , the lcd is very dark and flickers constantly .
camera	installing the software was a piece of cake , using it is quite another matter . the basic introductory instructions are easy enough but after that it seems to require a phd in mathematic astrophysics to get round all the available toggles , tweaks and options . first attempts ? the moon came out real nice , but saturn was a white blob with no fine detail . nothing like type of pics that the super-whizzkids proudly display on the celestron site . will go back to night school and one day you might see my fine efforts published as well ( oh - was using it on a classic lx200 in good see'ing conditions - sorry celestron !
camera	we bought this bag for our panasonic pv-gs400 video camera , this bag is just the perfect size , we can fit our pv-gs400 , tapes , extra batteries , recharger , video cables , remote control , and even a small tripod . has different comparments . on top of functionality is done with a very high quality . i highly recommend it , just check your camera dimensions and compare with the bag before you buy
camera	i 'm still learning to use this camera and all the features . so far it is amazing . i 've been taking pictures of the kids and it looks like a pro did the shots . i use the auto mode a lot and it works great . the zoom is amazing . i love that it tells me when i am focused . also it has great battery life . i 'm very happy with this camera
camera	i was extremely disappointed with this camera . it 's a shame there is no option for zero stars , because it does n't even deserve one . i bought two of them for a vacation to belize because we were planning to do a lot of activities in and around the water , and we were hoping to capture those memories without risk to our digital camera . now i really regret not putting a little more money into a waterproof case for our digital camera rather than wasting money on this camera and developing pictures that were only worthy of the garbage can . all of the pictures from both cameras were very grainy - terrible , terrible quality . the camera that we took pictures with while diving was slightly better than the one we never even submerged in the water . those pictures were so grainy that we could n't even tell what the pictures were supposed to be of . extremely disappointing for a camera that was n't even submerged in water . not to mention both cameras said that there were more pictures left on the roll when there were none , so we took shots that we thought were going to be really amazing only to find that they were n't even on the negatives . i was so disappointed in this camera that i wrote to kodak and they offered to send me two new disposable cameras . unfortunately our trip to belize was a once in a lifetime trip , so i have absolutely no need for replacements - the damage is done . and i have no desire to ever use one of these cameras again . if you are planning on using a disposable waterproof camera for capturing valuable memories , do not waste your money on this one . the only thing you will receive from the photo lab is disappointment . i wish i had done more research before purchasing this one - please do n't even bother with it
camera	after springing for the cybershot in august so i could have a compact camera i would actually take places , i 've been very , very pleased . the last camera i had was an older sony dsc that was quite bulky , ran on batteries , and had shutter problems -- but it took great quality pictures and the interface and features were perfect , so i thought i would go for the dsct5 , since it avoids all of those problems . only a tiny battery to charge , no sticky shutter ... and it 's sexy as hell . the screen is huge and very bright . i hate taking pictures with flash in general , and i find that the flash makes nasty redeye more often than not with this camera . ( and the camera gives you the impression you cant change shutter speed or anything ) however ! you can easily change this by going into the over/under exposure options and under exposing your photos when you are in dark environments . they come out surprisingly well and blur-free
camera	i bought this lens based on the super telephoto ability and low cost . you truly get what you pay for , and this thing is n't worth a plug nickel . i took a few shots on a tripod and could not believe how terrible this lens was @ 300mm ( 480mm on a digital rebel xt ) . incredibly soft . even stopped down , i would never want to make an enlargement from it . stay away . do n't believe the fools who are novices , you will be disappointed with this lens . you 're much better off to buy the older used 100-300mm 5.6 ( the l version costs more too ) but both are so much better than this junker . you 're even more crazy if you think you can take decent photo 's with this lens handheld . having switched from nikon when switching to digital , i almost judged canon from this one lens , which i 'm glad i did n't . do n't waste your money or learn the hard way like i did . this lens also had terrible purple fringing , almost as bad as the kit 18-55mm . after extensive research and testing i now own and am happy with the following canon lenses : canon 10-22mm canon 28-105mm ( 3.5 version ) canon 100-300mm ( 5.6 non-l version ) i will sell for the l version when i can afford it . the kit 18-55mm makes usable shots , but when i could afford it , i sold it too . you will get better results buying a rebel xt and an older 100-300mm than you would with a brand new xti and this terrible 75-300mm lens .
camera	over 90 % of pictures i took by this canon are blurry . no way can you fix it . i really got fed up with it . waist your money . waist your time . more important , waist your precious moments !
camera	i have used the camera for three months , and absolutely love it ! the pictures are crisp ( even very close-ups ) , and the video feature is right up there . sound pick-up is excellent . i have created two dvd 's combining videos and still pictures . folks have thought the quality was very good . the battery life was rated very good , and i have found this to be true . i carry the camera with me nearly everywhere i go . people are impressed with the size . drawbacks ? because of its size , there are no connections from the camera to a computer , tv or battery charger . the docking station is small and lightweight . because of the battery life , i have never been away from home long enough to need recharging . i recommend the camera without reservations , and will look first to casio in the future
camera	i love everything about this camera but ... .the display is very touchy . i only owned the camera for 2 months and my display broke . i had it in a case and must have bumped it just right . my display shattered . mind you there is not a view finder so you can only guess what you are taking pictures of . this is not covered under your warranty . my camer has been in the repair shop for 3 weeks now and since the camera is so new there is no parts available yet . so i am sitting here with no camera , which is really bothersome since i love taking pictures . i figured i would spend more for a nice quality camera and have no worries but who knew this would happen ! so i highly recommend this camera but you must be very very careful with it !
camera	the photoshare digital frame is a classic example of poor engineering . the `` plug and play '' ability is aggravating , at best , freezing two of my computers , requiring endless reboots to transfer images . photoshare provides zero customer support or technical assistance when you have problems interpreting the very poor operations manual . the expensive battery is almost impossible to install . the power cord has to be super glued to stay in place . and the frame is sloppy and dangerous - very easy for unit to fall out . buy another brand or just put pictures on disc and use a portable dvd player instead .
camera	it fits in the s1 , but it does n't always charge -- the contacts arent the same size as the oem version . when it does n't charge i just re-insert the batter and it works , but its sort of a bummer
camera	i am far from an expert however even for an amatuer this lens was horrible . i took about 400 shots with my digital rebel xt and got so frustrated witht the poor quality of the auto focus that i immediately returned it / got a refund . in all but the brightest lighting conditions this lens was extremely slow with the autofocus . in many cases the lens could not focus and continually hunted through it 's entire range . since most of my photography is of animals i simply could not wait for the autofocus to work and missed many shots . i tested the autofocus against my canon 18-55 ef-s ( packaged with the rebel xt ) and a canon 75-300 ef . in every instance where the tamron could not focus the canon lenses had no problem ! when the tamron would focus i found the pictures were not as sharp as my canon lenses . again i 'm far from an expert however i was only printing 4x6 photos . i replaced the tamron with a quantaray ( sigma ) 55-200 dc which has proven to have a very good autofocus and great optical quality ( for amatuers.. ) bottom line.. it was hard to part with the tamron because i was really enthused about the zoom range however i would much prefer to use 2 lenses can focus than 1 that does n't . i have read many reviews with the same problem noted . tamron needs to get thier act together
camera	hi , i bought this camera and installed the driver from both the cd and then the web . it caused my computer ( a good , modern , fast computer ) to crash both times . the camera worked without interfacing with the computer , but , then , what 's the point ? also , the pictures and movies were very grainy and low quality . the tech support when i had these problems was horrible . they really did n't stand behind the product at all and to me that 's the most important thing ! maybe i could have gotten it to work , but not without some input from aiptek . i 've never written one of these reviews before , but this really got to me . do n't buy this camera is my advice .
camera	date on still photo will not print , it 's no good where yoy need that type of info on the printed photo
camera	this is not the best way to get started in astronomy . the low power eyepiece is fairly useful , the higher power one less so , and do n't even think of using the barlow . the maximum useful magnification for a 60mm scope is about 120-140x , assuming the objective lens is of good quality . when you use the middle and high magnifications provided with this scope , you exceed that limit and the increased image size is more than offset by breakdown . to their credit , the manufacturer has provided a reflex `` red dot '' finder in place of the useless 5x24 finders that plague so many similar scopes . even so , what you can expect to see in this scope is rather limited . some star clusters will be dimly visible , but galaxies and nebulae will be barely -- if at all -- visible . in a way , it is hard to fault celestron for making and marketing this scope . their upper-tier instruments are quite good , but the big money appears to be made on mass market toys like this . in one sense the sale of these scopes subsidizes their good models . just make sure , gentle reader , to stay away from the toys . using an astronomical telescope is not like playing an mp3 file and but rather like playing a guitar . it is a learned skill . and you must do a lot of homework before you buy a telescope . buying without prior experience is like buying a car without knowing anything about driving . if you want to see the wonders of the sky , contact your local astronomy club and attend one of their star parties . the members love sharing their hobby and can set you straight as to how to get started . the best way is to learn the sky with the unaided eye and 10x50 binoculars ( decent ones are available on amazon ) , then graduate to something along the lines of a 150-200mm ( 6-8 '' ) dobsonian ; celestron 's own 6 '' starhopper can be found on amazon for under $ 290 . for more information on buying telescopes , see my encyclopedic guide on amazon : `` so you want to buy a telescope .
camera	unlike many reviewers i am not diver . i bought this to for the peace of mind that my camera would n't get ruined taking pictures of my son at the water park , pool , and beach . this equipment exceeded my expectations with always clear photo and underwater flash . this case has out lived an s400 and s500 . well worth the $ 170 price tag
camera	i stumbled across this little gem by accident . i was picking up supplies at office depot and they had a kodak z650 ( display model ) on sale for under $ 100 . it was a ridiculous impulse buy -- i already own 4 digital cameras ... the last thing i needed was another camera ! but what a delighful suprise this camera turned out to be ! it 's come the closest to rivaling the image quality of my old olympus c-740 . i had never seriously looked at kodak cameras ... i always steered clear of them based on bad press and negative comments about them from my friends who are `` serious '' photographers . but i could n't be happier with this little bargain ... it basically serves the need i wanted to fill -- a 6mp camera that takes the kind of quality shots i was used to with my c-740 . there are a few negatives in that it can be a little slow in processing the shots , but there is very little shutter-lag when taking the shots . i 've gotten some amazing birds-in-flight shots with it -- something i 've never been able to accomplish with any of my other cameras , including the c-740 . some low-contrast shots come out a bit noisy , but for the most part the shots are very crisp and sharp . it handles low-light settings better than any of the others in this class that i 've tried . at less than a third of the price of my canon s2-is , this little camera outclasses the others by a mile . i stumbled on to a good find in the z650 ... it 's not going to give you dlsr quality photos , but no point-and-shoot will . this camera is perfect for any one who likes to take great outdoor and wildlife shots . i just wish someone would have given a good report on kodak cameras before i spent a small fortune on the others
camera	well , i do n't even know where to start for this camera . but about a year ago , when this camera first got launched to the digital camera market , it costed nearly twice as much as what you can pay for it now . for the price , this camera has alot to offer . i just love the color tone of fujifilm . you get a very studio-like effect with fujifilm ccd technology . this camera has many manual controls and features that will interest both professional and amature photographers . the 9 megapixel can really be helpful when it comes to cropping . the pictures taken by this camera is bright and clear . the camera picture can be noisy if you set the iso above 400 . so , for the best result , just set the iso level as low as possible ( lets say iso 80 ? ) . the 10.7x zoom lens is very convenient when you want to get close to the subject you are shooting . i used this camera for every occasion and it never failed me . i heard alot of complaints about the poor battery life of this camera , but just buy nimh battery that is about 2500 mah and above and you should get about 200-250 shots . make sure to buy at least a 2 gb memory card because the picture files are pretty big , especially in raw format . also , for the price , this camera feels very solid in the hand . it feels very professional and sturdy ( made in japan ) . the buttons are nicely placed and very easy to use . make sure to buy an external flash if you want to do some serious light photography . i recommnend the sunpak 383 non-dedicatted flash to go with this camera . it works together really well . anyway , for $ 407 , you can not get a better camera than this one . thank you amazon for making this good deal possible . again , i highly recommend this camera .
camera	the camera fits perfectly . the case is very stylish . best of all , its pink
camera	easy , fast and serius tool , for cleaning your optics . the easy use is discribe in the manual that is very clear to understand . cleaning is fast with the nikon lens pen , cuase it has the necesary to do the job well done , as any profesional tool . now i have 2 of them , for my two camera bags .
camera	i agree with the two previous reviewers . there needs to be a user manual and there is n't one . the fine adjustment will adjust the vertical angle maybe 15 degrees . this is n't very helpful for star gazing . the maximum height of the tripod is only 45 inches . this is an uncomfortable height for looking through binoculars while standing . celestron should have a users guide showing how their tripod and binoculars are supposed to work together
camera	5 stars ... easy to use . the screen is large and clear . the automatic settings include a variety of scene selections ( ie beach , party , fireworks scenes ) . i have yet to use the video , so i can not comment on that . i think this is a great all-around camera , and it fits in the smallest purses ... big plus . the screen has yet to get scratched in all my purse juggling . my only complaint would be in the shipping . i paid extra to expedite my order since i was leaving the country a few days later . it was sent via ups with a signature `` in person '' required . when i missed ups the first time , i was unable to just sign the paper and leave it on my door . i had to contact ups to find out when they would return so i could sign in person , which was an ordeal . i wish i would 've known that the camera was being sent this way . i would 've requested that no signature be required .
camera	i 'd be stating the obvious and preaching to the choir if i said that care of lenses for slr cameras required a decent lens cap . this one snaps into 58mm threads on the end of many lenses ( canon and otherwise ) , so just be sure to confirm that that it 's the proper size for your lens
camera	wonderful camara , excellent characteristics , has an ample selection of accessories available and protected by one of you lead in manufacture of camaras and lenses
camera	the product advertisement is misleading or incomplete ( no picture of the actual contents ) . the following quote is from fuji mall : `` ac adapter : charge your batteries at home or around the world with the travel adapters . '' what it fails to mention is that the charger is an external charger only , and you can not power the camera or charge batteries while in the camera . i was looking for an ac adapter that i can power the camera ( and charge it 's batteries inside the camera ) . the nimh cells are not the 2500 ma/hr rating that comes with the e900 camera ( they are 2000 ma/hr , but this was noted in the product specifications ) . i teach a photography class and needed an ac adapter to power each camera used during the class while demonstrating . this product does not meet this criteria . it can however charge up to 4-aa batteries at a time , and includes an auto adapter which is handy . case is bulky , not small enough to tote an e900 conveniently when not bringing the charger equipment
camera	i have owned this camera for about a year and i have never really enjoyed it . for a point and shoot it is bad , it takes pictures way too slowly and i often miss out on a good shot . it is also not as user friendly as i would have hoped it to be with so many scene settings . while i enjoy some of them , most of the time my pictures turn out grainy ( in low light ) , whitewashed ( with flash ) or blurry ( of even slowly moving objects ) . i have tried changing the exposure time and shutter speed to counter some of these things , but i rarely get a good picture when i need it . i never had these problems with my elph s200 . this camera is also a lot more bulkier as well , and the cover over the lens has started to stick so that it does not fully open when turned on . if given the option i would not buy this camera again
camera	i bought this camera in about february 2005 but did n't know enought about digital to know what i can actually get . goes through batteries pretty fast . the recharge time between pictures sometimes causes me to miss another good shot . takes way too much time between pressing shutter button and taking the picture . i just thought this was normal for digital cameras till i began reading later reviews . then i accidentally dropped the camera onto a soft surface ( loose dirt and sawdust ) and now the lens is stuck most of the way out and will not retract and camera will not come on . contacted hp to get it fix but will cost close to $ 100 and they will just send a reconditioned one . so i am in the market for another digital camera-maybe a canon or sony or something besides an hp
camera	dont bother upgrading your power shot camera ... just buy a better one . the zoom lens ads a whole 5 ft to the view before the pixels become a big issue
camera	not worth the money spent on it . after reviewing info on my new digital camera i followed suggestions to get the rechargeable batteries kit to save money on aa batteries . i did not need the camera case that came with this kit , and it really had too many pockets for my liking . the batteries did not hold a charge . i only got a few pictures taken before they went dead . if the spare set sat in the camera for a few days they too were dead . at least i got a full set of pictures taken on the duracell ones . i would much rather buy batteries and have them on hand then always be running back to the charger after a few shots . i have had no experience with rechargables before so i do not know if this is common . but i returned this item as a defect because for this amount of money you should get more then six pictures per charge
camera	the best buy in the marketplace . it easily fits into my suitcase for travel ... the level works nicely and very sturdy for as light as it is
camera	for years now i have been buying `` bargain '' cameras with the foolish notion that i did not need a nice one . finally , i got sick of it and bought the exilim ex-z600 . this camera is awesome . the screen is huge , the picture quality is great , it is easy to use and is sooo small . overall , a great buy . the one downside is that i can only connect it to my computer using the dock . luckily , i have an sd card reader , so i normally just use that to download my pictures
camera	the balance with the grip on is really much better . yes i am aware there were problems with some earlier ones , but mine seems just fine ( knocking on wood as i type )
camera	we bought this camera because our other digital camera ( sony dsc-h1 ) was too large to carry around a lot of the time . we took it skiing with us ( whistler , bc ) and it took some outstanding pictures , both of persons and of landscape/scenery . it is small enough that you can pretty much carry it anywhere , anytime . others may disagree , but the touchscreen menu controls are easy to use and fairly intuitive . fingerprints do get on the screen but you hardly notice them and they are easily removed ( or better yet , use the little wand they give you with the camera instead of your fingers , that does n't leave any marks on the screen ) . to summarize : this is an excellent camera , very small size but with a large 3 '' led display , takes excellent pictures , and the touchscreen menu is easy to use and intuitive . most people will be very happy with this camera if they buy it . the only negative thing is that this camera does not have a view finder , but unless you have very bright sun at your back this is n't too much of a problem .
camera	we love this camcorder ! we bought it because our other bulky , digital video that uses tapes , which we would have to copy onto vhs/dvd , stopped working . we did n't want to spend a lot of money . we loved the idea that it was easier to carry in my purse and you could download it straight to the computer or burn it ( which is very simple to do , and you do not have to download any software . ) i have to admit i was a little reluctant that the quality of the picture would be less than great , and only 60 minutes concerned me , but the pictures is great and i have n't ran out of time yet . we have used this indoors , outdoors and have no problems . we have recorded our son 's basketball games and it worked great . we read where the batteries did n't last very long , but we have been using rechargeable batteries and have been impressed with lifetime they have . this is a must for those who have children or grandchildren
camera	i 've had this camera for 2 years and i am glad that it broke so i can ( in good conscious ) buy a new camera . it is so slow that it is impossible to catch anything but the back of my kids heads as they run away because they got tired of saying `` cheese '' . i always thought the battery life was sufficient , and that the quality of the images was fine , but i hardly got good shots because of how slow the camera was . i 'd put the shoot button and it would take about 2 seconds before the camera would click . i actually sent it back to the manufacturer thinking there was something wrong with it , but they said it was functioning normally . it was probably the most disappointing $ 200 purchase i 've made
camera	after three weeks the batteries fails . i buy a knew one in walmart , and less expensive
camera	i bought this camera two years ago , the pictures were always perfect , even though from the sixth month it started getting stains everywhere , but then i found out that it was normal , not good but it usually happens to this cameras . but the worst of all is tha fact that it displays the error 18 ( e18 ) , the lens gets stock and the camera wo n't work at all . i searched in google about it , because the user guide says nothing about this error , and then i read many reviews that said that there was nothing to do about it and many canon cameras have the same defect ... i am really mad and dissapointed on canon , i will never buy a camera of this brand , and i would n't recommend it , unless you are willing to buy a camera for 2 years or less and then throw your money to the trash
camera	i bought this for my husband for valentine 's day , so he could have photos of our new baby boy handy . unfortunately , the images appeared for one day , and then the unit stopped working . we had to send the unit back . i was very disappointed as there were many good ratings on the item .
camera	to customer before me , you camera d200 might be on recall . please check the nikon website for more info . you have described the exact recall problem . good luck ! btw , have you tried or someone tried this battery on a d70 ? i am thinking to consolidate and have all greys batteries rather than black for the d70 and grays from the d200 .
camera	the powershot a520 on switch stopped working right after i started using the camera
camera	i have received this camera for serveral weeks . it 's a good long zoom digital camera . i can use it for 18x optical zoom when i set its photo size less than 3m ez . the photo is n't blur as i use image stabilized . the picture is sharp . image quality is good . however i have to set the iso at 100 or 200 . when the iso is 400 or above , i can see the noise , and the picture lose detail . but every camera has its own defect . overall , i am satified with this camera , and i am enjoying using it to take pictures .
camera	i got this for my mom when i got the digital frame for my husband it is very easy to download pictures on and she can show off all of her grandbabies this is an awsome gift for anyone the color and pictures are great
camera	the look and feel of this camcorder is very good . unfortunately my camcorder use is limited to low light indoor activities . for example , evening party , indoor school activities , kid drama and orchestra . this camcorder is not at all suitable for these activities . earlier i had a sony dcr trv140 , which was way better than this camcorder . this camcorder has a very small sensor and hence such a low price . one easy guide to evaluate the sensor size is to look at the optical zoom . most of the camcorders with more than 10x optical zoom has small sensors . these large optical zoom camcorders will perform poorly in low light . if you are planning to use this camcorder in low indoor light , i do not recommend it .
camera	i bought these binoculars because i wanted a medium size pair to use primarily for birding . first time out , i had difficulty getting a clear focus . to make maters worse , every bird that i looked at had a halo of red chromatic aberration around it 's head . i have a pair of nikon 10x25s which out performed the bushnell 's hands down in terms of both clarity and sharpness . i am returning the bushnell 's and considering the audubon equinox hp binoculars instead .
camera	not worth the $ 10 i paid especially when i had to spend $ 7 to ship it ! !
camera	looked at a number of cameras including the tz3 , p5000 , and a few others . nothing compared to the g7 which is the one i ended up going with ; is , 6x lens , incredible quality , etc . if you want the best camera out there and do n't feel like messing with a dslr , the canon g7 is in a league of it 's own ~ the benchmark by which all other manufacturers strive towards .
camera	fast delivery , great price . i would buy from them again , thanks =
camera	i have another camera w/ 12x optical tons of features but i wanted something compact ready to take quick snaps . this fits the bill . on my recent vacation i was impressed with how quickly it booted up and focused in to get those unplanned shots . the x-large screen makes it really easy to see if you got a good one and the image stabilisation seems to work better than on my previous camera ( canon a80 ) ... either that or my hand is steadier . last but not least - the battery life was impeccable . i took a nearly 200 photos , plus spent a lot of time reviewing and showing off pics to friends with no need to recharge . the battery is a 'custom ' one which concerned me but the charger is very compact and travels well . it has integrated prongs that fold flat when not in use - no cables : )
camera	i just got my new photo box today . i was so excited i opened it at work . then i took a picture of my wendy 's salad just to see how it looked . the quality of the pictures are excellent ( macro mode ) . light is evenly distributed . caution about the lights : the lights get really hot really fast . untouchable within 2min . after i turn them on . i suggest for the shear sanctity of safety , shut off the lights between object/scene changes . the package arrived intact , the box was beat up a little , nothing major . when i opened the item , i noticed the camera stand had pierced the nylon on the bottom . this could 've been a bad/weak stitch , or may have happened during shipping , but nothing major was wrong , only that . besides , i can sew it ! overall , this is a great product , and is easy to setup and carry around . i 'd definitely buy again
camera	pros : compact , lightweight , portability , easy to use , big screen , good reproduction cons : microphone sensitive to wind , getting used to not having a viewfinder , bad low light performance . summary : i picked this camera as an upgrade for my old canon zr10 . the first reason i chose it was the small size and portability . with a good light conditions , this little beast do its best shots , but in low light conditions this camera disapointed me ( specially compared with mi old zr10 ) . please do n't buy it if you have plans to use it for stills shots because it has a low resolution . the included handycam station have all the ports ( firewire , usb , power , video ) you need to conect it . the big touch screen is a must , because the screen is the only way to access the camera controls ( besides some of them in the edge of the screen ) . you can have a camera with more characteristics and better image quality for the same price , but if your concern is the size and portability this will be your best choice in the world of the mini dv format
camera	do n't listen to the reviews that claim that this lens is not a good choice for cropped sensor cameras ( ie the 20d , 30d , rebels etc ) the canon l lens are the best and this particular lens is no exception . i have had the lens for less than 24 hours now and am in love with the sharpness and color already . great lens , great color , so well built , super sharp , just watch out if this is your first l lens , you 'll be hooked . this is a lens you will have for many years , great investment
camera	this camera will probably go down in nikon 's history as one of its most over-priced and disappointing cameras . i bought mine through amazon from calumet in january 2003 . from the start , the colors never looked right , especially the ghastly magenta-toned skin tones . i also bought the sb800s ( 3 of them ) , thinking the cls would be a great addition . but the system uses ir and is unreliable in any situation except very tight environments . the camera has a wonderful feel , viewfinder and reasonably good controls . but the results are disappointing . the sensor is undersized for this class of camera and considering what its competition ( canon ) offers . nikon finally realized this and on dec. 13 decided to dump all these cameras by lowering the price $ 1,200 . it just so happened mine was in melville , n.y. , with a long list of issues to be repaired while it was still under warranty . these include bad af performance since upgrading to v2 of the firmware , bad color , overexposure , blurry images with the vr lens and inconsistent color balance from frame to frame even when using a preset value . i would strongly suggest that you do n't buy this camera and thereby reward nikon for producing an inferior product originally sold at a ridiculous price for what it offers . indeed , forget nikon and go to canon
camera	i shoot with a canon 20d and have used the canon ef 75-300mm f/4.5-5.6 iii usm lens . i 've always noticed the limitations of this lens when shooting amateur softball . i reviewed the lens lineup at the canon website and decided on the canon ef 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6l usm lens . the 100-400mm is a great lens , but it can be a bit soft . for that reason i decided to add the canon ef 70-200mm 2.8/f is usm telephoto zoom lens to my lens collection . this is a serious lens meant for serious photographers . being an l lens , there is a lot of features and is manufactured with better materials with a high level of dust and moisture resistance . the construction is sturdy and consists of 23 elements in 18 groups . the four super ud-glass elements largely eliminate the secondary spectrum reducing residual chromatic aberration . an improved 8-blade circular aperture offers a more pleasing out-of-focus image . the canon ef 70-200mm lens weighs in at about 3.24 lbs/1,470 g , and accepts 77mm filters with a minimal focusing distance of 4.3 ft/1.3 m. this lens is compatible with the extenders 1.4x ii and 2x ii . be sure to get a good quality uv haze filter to protect the front lens element . being white , this lens looks a bit strange , but helps keep it stay cool when shooting in the sun . some people are concerned that being white , it attracts attention to criminals . from my experience , my 20d attracts attention regardless of what lens i put on it . in addition , i most likely have a camera bag and tripod/monopod with me to further attract attention . i personally doubt a thief looking for something to steal is taking the time to evaluate the cost of the item and are more concerned with the ease of taking something they can unload . i try to make things difficult for would be thieves and have insurance as a back up . the dual is system has two modes . mode 1 is for stationary subjects while mode two is for moving subjects . it is recommended that the is function is not used on a tripod ; however i have used it on my monopod with success . the is helps to eliminate camera shake and helps stabilize the lens when shooting from a moving vehicle . while there are limitations to what the is can do , it can give you a few extra stops . just keep in mind , the is attempts to eliminate camera movement , not the movement of the subject being photographed . this lens permits for auto or manual focus depending on how the switch is set . there is also a switch to shift from a 1.4m/4.6ft to infinity or 2.5m/8.2ft to infinity . included with this lens are the tripod mount , lens hood , and storage case . the tripod mount is the best option to use when mounting to a tripod . this helps to balance the load . mounting the camera instead creates an unbalanced set up that may topple over . the case is a zippered soft case ( lz1324 ) that can also be purchased separately . the lens hood ( et-86 ) is used to reduce lens flare and can protect the front element in certain situations . often times , amazon recommends purchasing the lens case and hood , however they are normally included with the lens . the canon ef 70-200mm is such an awesome lens , it almost fails to compare to the canon ef 75-300mm . the canon 100-400mm lens is a well used option for me , but the clarity and sharpness of the 70-200mm is lens is more refined . the auto-focus is quiet and quick . this lens can be used for portraits , landscape , sports or as a general walk about lens . the f/2.8l combined with the is makes this a good option for certain low light situations . the features add creative versatility . the canon ef 70-200mm is lens comes at a price , but it is worth every bit of it . pros : incredible clarity and sharpness quiet and quick auto-focus features add creative versatility dual is system cons : heavy and bulky ( this should be expected with these types of lenses
camera	this is the best price i found for my second rechargeable battery for my nikon coolpix 5200 . it 's perfect , and so nice to have a second battery ! ! ! it was shipped so fast , i received it within a few days
camera	canon has three digital cameras for $ 2,500+ . the 1ds mark ii , the 1d mark iin and the relatively new 5d . i chose canon over nikon ( which i 've shot most of my photographic life ) because of canon 's more impressive suite of lenses . here 's the decision process i went through . as with most products , it comes down to how you 'll use it . all of them have tradeoffs . 1 . megapixels . more pixels - with a few caveats - translates into an image that can be enlarged ( and cropped more tightly ) with less deterioration . the 1ds is the market leader at 16.7mp , the 5d comes in at 12.7mp and the 1d at 8.2mp . if you 're a commercial art or magazine photographer the 1ds probably makes sense . if you 're a wedding photographer , the 5d is probably the sweet spot . in practice , however , the difference in pixels between these cameras will not make an appreciable difference for most people . at 8.2mp , you can make an 11x17 print at 200 pixels/inch without any enlargement beyond the camera 's native resolution . up to that size , you certainly wo n't see much difference in prints from the three cameras . that said , the higher megapixels of the other cameras gives you more extreme cropping lattitude . 2 . full frame . the 1ds and 5d are full frame - that means the sensor in the camera will capture the view of the scene that you 're accustomed to seeing with your 35 mm film camera . the 1d and most digital cameras have what is called a field of view crop factor ( fovcf ) . for the 1d , it 's 1.3x . what that means is that both the viewfinder and the image sensor do n't capture everying the lens is `` seeing '' - it crops the view in a little tighter . the result : your lenses are effectively 1.3x longer . a 70 mm lens becomes a 91 mm lens and so on . because the camera is effectively `` cropping '' the edges of the image that the lens produces , it also tends to eliminate the softness or vignetting that appears at the edges of some lenses . whatever camera you use , what you see in the viewfinder is still what you get , and it does n't affect the pixel resolution of the image . my 300 mm lens with a 1.4x extender and a 1.3x fovcf is effectively a 546 mm lens - getting into birding territory . ( if you 're switching from film to digital , some of your lenses may may no longer fit your needs with the focvf . your 35 mm lens is no longer really a wide angle at 45 mm . ) 3 . durability . this was most important to me , though it may not be for someone who does n't shoot in extreme conditions or expects to replace their camera in two years . both the 1ds and 1d sport complete metal bodies , sealed against the weather with a shutter that will last at least 200,000 cycles . the 5d - a very solid camera - is designed for 100,000 , is not weather sealed and has more plastic components . 4 . weight/size . what a solid , metal body giveth in durability it taketh away in weight . for those who prefer a camera with heft , these have it . for many people , this is a big drawback . the 1ds and 1d are 43 oz. , or almost three pounds for just the body , without the big battery . add the battery and you 're at 54 oz . the 5d is just 29 oz . and 31 oz . with battery . the 1ds and 1d , with built-in vertical grips , are also more than 2 inches taller . if you 're looking for something less obtrusive and easier to carry around , the 5d is it . 5 . speed . there 's a reason the 1d is the camera of choice for photojournalists , sports and many bird photographers . it shoots at a smooth 8.5 frames per second , compared to 4 fps for the 1ds and 3 fps for the 5d . for most day-to-day uses , 3 fps is more than adequate . from using both , i 'd say the 1d autofocuses a bit faster , too . the 1d has 45 autofocus points , compared to nine for the 5d . 6 . price . give or take a hundred here or there , the 1ds is about $ 7,200 ; the 1d about $ 3,900 ; and the 5d about $ 3,000 . price will determine whether you get the 1ds or not . if you can afford it , go for it . otherwise , other features - or the possiblity of buying more lenses instead of more camera - will make your decision . what did i decide ? first , i looked at how i 'd use the camera : photojournalism , travel and wildlife photography . the higher fps was not as important to me as durability and autofocus speed , so either the 1d or 1ds would do . in the end , i decided i 'd rather spend the money on lenses that would not be obsolete with the next new and improved camera . ( i bought the 300 f/2.8 is for close to the difference in price . ) so , i went with the 1d mark iin . if my camera was generating some good cash flow or my wife did n't need a new car , i 'd probably have gone with the 1ds . i 'm very happing with the decision and the camera . for most people and most uses - general portrait , landscape and travel photography - the 5d is probably the way to go . ( or perhaps the next greatest camera that canon will announce later this year .
camera	on reciept of the tripod , i found it wrapped and packed ( on the outside ) in a manner that should have insured an undammaged product . when i opened the box , i found a tripod that looked like it had been run over by a fork lift and then thrown into the box . there was minimal packing around the tripod itself , mostly just nylon bags to prevent scratching , and nothing to keep the unit from being tossed around . i have to wonder about the quality control prior to shipping . also , if you are not familure with how to assemble and work this type of tripod you will be better served with a different model or company , instructions are not part of their package
camera	this fugifilm padded soft case is strong , durable and very attractive . it was more than i expected . it is very professional looking
camera	i bought this to play back old hi8 tapes so i could transfer them to dvd . however , there is no s-video out and no stereo out . video quality was bad : output was noisey and reds were over saturated . i imagine this is because there is no s-video out . i returned it and have ordered a sony gv-d200 . hopefully it will give me better quality since it was more than twice as much . there are some cheaper used options available , e.g . sony evo-250
camera	i enjoy the tc80n3.you may think it 's costly , but the features are out standing.i think it was worth the buy.the only disappointment i have is there is no `` on , off '' power switch
camera	very good product very satisfied , the night vision is great clarity is very good and portability is awesome plus the price is even bette
camera	i bought this camera more than half a year ago . my intention was to get a decent camera for images , but then also be able to use it for filming short movies . i 'm very pleased with its performance . in good lighting conditions , colors come out to be amazing . i really really did not expect them to be so vivid and sparkling ! in darker conditions , well , it still works fine , not nearly as bad as i expected from some other reviews . photos might be grainy or not as vivid anymore , but the stuff is still perfectly suitable to show the photos to people . as about filming , it 's terrific . i mean , resolution is great ( sth like 848 by 640 or so ) , better than what one could possibly expect from a regular camera . and the quality is super awesome , looks very neat on computer screen . respect . it has to be pointed out that you can not zoom while filming , but not many cameras out there can do that . oh , it 's also very small with a gigantic screen and great battery life . a great buy
camera	easily snaps in place and does the job . considerably less expensive than the local retail outlet - and delivery was quick as well
camera	well at least , some stuff is cool , free cam bag , the pics come out excellent . the video feature is really crappy and when you play back video its very choppy and the audio is a little hard to know whats being heard . also you could through dozens of batteries with this cam . the adapter doesnt help only if youre going to sit down and review whats on it or keep the power from draining . the sd card kept popping out for someone which caused the cam to `` freeze up '' . bottom line ... i recommend at least researching other brands of mini-tapeless cams ... but this one ... isnt worth 159 or whatever . its trash . go for something else
camera	ok , i imagine if you forked over the $ 900 for this baby you would not want me telling you that you got a bad deal , but i am going to say it anyway . this little baby is way over priced , not to mention you need a lot more than just this to make it work . you need a wireless router ! ! so rather than just complain , let me tell you what i want canon to do about it and maybe we can start a revolution ! with cf cards in the 12gb range it does n't make sense that you would need this for capacity reasons ( i know those of you with the biggest and brightes 16mp that shoot in jpeg raw on the highest settings just laughed at me ) , however where this item is worth it is if you want to immediately see your shots on a big screen or computer without having to take the shot , take out the card , etc . what i want is a bluetooth compact flash card . they make these so i know it is possible . i would like canon to offer support for these compact flash cards so that i can immediately sync my bluetooth computer with my bluetooth camera . now that would make it so that when i am in the studio or shooting a wedding , i have the mobility 30 feet - 90 feet depending on card and i do n't have to drag along a wireless router and i saved myself $ 700 . get to it canon - i am waiting ! ! !
camera	my hunting buddy purchased a nikon 800 . my intent was to put him in the shade . that nikon kicks the crap out of my bushnell yardage pro 1000 . tried new batteries , tried bluffing , even tried to lie but nothing helped this product past 500/600 yards . my opinion is this product is not worth the postage . anyone with similar opinion or someone that has had a good experience with this product . [ ...
camera	very clear , bright day , strong magnification quality seems to be good . very well priced at around $ 100.00.i will know more over the passage of time .my firstimpression is good mj schra
camera	combine the high iso , low noise and fast shutter speed for great blur free shots on low light and moving subjects . this is what only fuji can offer to you on compact camera class . the f31fd does n't have is ( image stabilized lenses or a ccd shift sensor ) , which other cameras use to reduce the effect of blur from camera shaking . but this kind of stabilization is really only useful for 6x or more zoom , for just 3x typical zoom on ultra compact p you just need to hold it firmly and will get the same results . is also ca n't prevent blur from moving subjects . with a high iso like on f31fd you can use faster shutter speeds that will freeze subjects and prevent blur from camera shaking too . fuji super ccd sensor provides the lowest noise on high iso you will find on 2007 's compact cameras , the quality is only comparable to the big dslr professional cameras . ah , and the face detection is not just a gimmick or marketing appeal ... it 's really great , specially if someone who does n't know how to focus on the face then recompose the scene is taking pictures of you , with f31fd they will not miss the shot
camera	as a professional photographer , i find myself going through 5-6 of these cords each year . my equipment is my livelyhood and although it is used often , i am exceptionally careful with all of my gear and do not bang it around or abuse it . i use a stroboframe which makes it necessary to use this cord to raise the flash well above the focal plane of the camera . these cords are very expensive to get just a few months out of them . eventually , the hot shoe connector will either become loose and the connection will no longer function or the plastic connector will break and your flash unit will fall to the ground . ( this has happened twice to me and fortunately i was able to catch the flash unit ! ) the cord is indespensible if you need it , but contact canon usa and ask them to reengineer this cord or expect to replace them every few months
camera	this is tough because this camera takes beautiful pictures . and it takes wonderful video . the downloading is easy and in general it 's a `` fine '' camera . however ... . the flash on it is nothing short of a nightmare . it 's constantly over exposing every subject . i find it practically un-usable . the only way i can get the image i 'm looking for in a lower light setting is to set the iso to 800 . if it had a 1600 iso i would n't need the flash at all practically but it does n't offer that . the other thing i do n't like that i did n't realize i would n't like is that it does n't have it 's own cradle in which to charge the batteries . the batteries have to be removed and charged seperately . does n't sound like a big deal but it is a pain when you think about it . the batteries lose their charge even when the camera is n't on which results in picking up the camera after 2 days and realizing it has no juice . intensely dissatisfying . this camera also has a really long delay from pushing the button to taking the picture . this results in lots of closed eyes and stupid faces . i know that most digitals have a delay but this one is epic . i am getting ready to sell this camera and buy a canon . i am a wedding photographer and shoot mostly with my canon 5d . but since this was rated camera of the year by american photo ( a publication i trust implicitly ) , i decided to stray from my canon . bad idea . i 'm going right to a powershot . do not pass go . do not collect $ 200 . i reccommend you do the same .
camera	ive gotten used to the disposable kodaks i got from the checkout isle at walmart . the problem with those , though , is that they run out of pictures pretty quick . the last straw was when we ran out of film at the family reunion just as cousin billy was about to show us how to catch a lizard with a rubber band and a twinky . at that point i knew i needed an upgrade . i ordered the canon eos-1ds mark ii the next day , for [ ... ] the feature that first caught my attention was the powerful zoom . now when i take a family picture , i like to step back about a mile or two , then zoom in and snap that high-resolution masterpeice . my wife always complains that i zoom too close into the big pores on her nose , to which i respond by suggesting she use clean and clear pore cleansing strips ( watch for her upcoming review of those soon ) . another useful feature of this camera is the continuous shooting mode . this is where the camera automatically takes pictures in rapid succession , about 5 per second . the other day i set the camera on the dresser , turned on the macarena , and got wild . i then took the individual pictures and strung them together into an animated flipbook . now watching myself do the macarena is a mere flip of the book away . man i can dance . to summarize , you will have a lot of fun with this cam like i did . definitely worth the [ ... ] ! but remember , there is a [ ... ] that comes with it ; so make sure you fill in the item number clearly on the [ ... ] card , and make sure you stay within the space alloted on the form otherwise the [ ... ] wont go through
camera	the frame and the pictures it displays are fine . sometimes it is a little hard to get it to download photos from my pc . my major complaint is the power supply . the original power supply dies after 4 months . it was repalced under warranty ( after some grief with customer service ) . the raplacement died some months later after the warranty had expired . i then had to buy one . that one died after a few months and the company did n't have the replacement in stock . after months of waiting from them to stock the item i gave up and after lots of searching on the web i found a supply made by another compay . i had to change the connector to make it match the connector on the frame . it 's been doing fine since then . i should note that my daughter has the same frame and has had almost identical problems . it looks like there are a lot more of these types of frames on the market now . i would do a lot of shopping before buying this one
camera	this is the perfect gift for any occasion.i bought one for my husband for his birthday and he took it to work next thing you know everyone was on here buying theirselves one.it is a very easy thing to load pics on and hook up to your tv.he sales cars and hes got his on his desk showing his family off and cars that they also have on the lot for the older people who are unable to withstand the heat so they sit right at his desk and check every car out on his digital frame.i give this frame an a++++++
camera	ok , maybe a 1 star is actually fair since my nose does n't smudge the lcd screen as much . the most annoying thing for me is it constantly falls off the camera . both my 30d and rebel xt . if i am lucky enough it will fall off , get lost and eventually i will not be reminded i wasted money on this accesory
camera	this is the perfect case for my sony m2 camera ! yes i said sony m2 ! this camera case is perfect for it.very sturdy and not expensive at all.cool sony cybershot insignia on it and good `` d '' ring for your belt.fits perfectly for my m2 and it has a very cool and stylish look to it ! 100 % recommended to those who need a case for their m1 or m2 sony cybershot
camera	this camera was a pain to pick the mode to get the camera to work . it 's batteries died all the time and lost all of the pictures . when you did get a picture loaded on the computer the software was terrible . we trashed it within 2 weeks of purchasing
camera	have never before provided a negative review but this is a product to avoid . instructions worthless -- only learned by reading reviews here that it is possible to change some display settings then went to much trial and error . after getting best possible settings , main problem is still picture quality : using high quality jpg files as input , photos display with about the visual sharpness of the sunday funnies -- individual dots very noticeable even at some distance . not at all like what i have seen in other digital picture frames . just arrived from amazon and intended as a v-day gift ( tomorrow ) for my wife , big disappointment , guess i better make a dash to the florist .
camera	we got this camcorder for our daughter for her birthday and she loves it ! her only problem with it is that a memory card is needed because there is n't as much space as she would like and alot of light is needed to film . we were aware of both of these complaints when we purchased it but we were certain that she could work around them . we were also aware of the battery problem , so she got rechargeable batteries . awesome little camcorder , especially for the price
camera	nowhere on the package is it indicated that this products requires a particular type of photo memory card ( ms or sd ) . it will not operate without it ! on the back of the package it reads `` download photos with usb cable ( incl . ) or simply insert memory card ( ms or sd - not incl . ) '' wording is extremely deceiving and implies that photos can be directly downloaded to the device - they can not
camera	if you can actually get the picture to turn out right , it does take pretty decent pictures . most of the time the photo is either over-exposed or too dark and grainy . it also only holds about 5 pictures , so you will have to buy a memory card if you want to really use this alot . i was a little disapointed with it due to the fact that it cost 40 dollars , and it does n't really seem worth it
camera	do not buy this camera , i repeat do not buy this camera ! just read the reviews and you 'll know exactly what i mean . lucky i got this piece of junk for christmas , so i did n't spend a dime on it . i opened the package before reading any reviews . now i wish i 've read the reviews before opening the box . i do n't care what setting you use , i tried them all and i have yet to take a picture any better than my cell phones camera . the lighting sucks , you either end up with dark pictures or super bright ones . i really wanted this camera to work , it looks sweet but sadly it ca n't take pictures .
camera	overall its a fine viewer however it has a couple of problems . # 1 ) it would be really nice if there was a way to copy pictures off of a sd card and into memory and vice versa . this would be invaluable for moving pictures around without having to hook things up to a computer . # 2 ) hooking it up to a computer is a pain , instructions are not helpful . if you are using the viewer to look at images off of sd cards in remote places ( ie trailcamera ) it works fine , but i 'd like the ability to move pictures off of a card into the viewers internal memory so i can leave the card with the trailcamera . # 3 this is nasty , if you cycle through the pictures too fast you can `` crash '' the viewer . upon resetting it , it will say there are no pictures found on the memory card . powering off , swapping cards wont help it read . the pictures are still there however but you need to then access the card directly through a computer to extract . reformat the card and it will be fine with the reader . for what i use it for i like it even though it has quirks that must be worked around .
camera	first of all i would like to say that i was very reluctant to buy a sony camera . after doing a lot of research for my needs i ended up with canon 800is and sony 's new toy t100 . ofcourse canon has the best overall ratings for ever but i wanted a stylish looking camera for my needs . sony t100 is the best looking camera i have seen . it 's features are awesome compared to it 's small size . you can take it everywhere . big bright screen on the back clearly visible in bright sunlight . it takes good indoor pictures too . i tried to play with its settings for while and thought that camera was not good . but then the best feature of the camera made it a winner for me . the auto mode takes great pictures and no need to set anything . sometimes changing auto iso helped to reduce the graniness but to be very honest if you are not going to blow the image to larger sizes ( which would be 99 % of the time atleast for me ) it wo n't make difference . just point and shoot . you get a perfect image for viewing on computers . no complaints apart from optional docking station which costs about $ 80 . 5x optical zoom is boon to me as 3x was merely zoom . also zomming while taking movies makes this a small camcoder with 640x480 30fps shooting . it does n't have touch screen like t50 and so it 's responsiveness is better . i would like it bit faster though . also camera takes pictures at very fast rate and the first picture you take is less than 2 secs . i would highly recommend this camera to anyone who can afford it .
camera	this camera does all that canon says it does . fantastic pictures . great flexibility for manual control or simple point-and-shoot use . i did a lot of research before buying , and i could not be happier with the canon g6
camera	i love this flash . i just recently purchased it and have used it for 2 big events and it worked perfectly . i still do n't know everything that it is capable of doing but am still able to work it just fine without even reading the manual . i would definitely recommend this flash .
camera	there some very detailed reviews , most of which i read before i ordered the camera from amazon . there is ample evidence that professionals will find the camera useful . i want to take a minute to speak for the rest of us . the camera came a month ago and i 've extremely happy with it . let me offer some perspective on my comments . the last camera i bought was a small sony shirt-pocket-sized camera that i was using alot and it got me back into taking pictures . i decided that since i was taking so many pictures i wanted a camera that would take much better quality shots , without my having to get a phd in picture-taking . i opted for this camera with the 18-200mm lens . i now take the same pictures i took with the small camera , but with the zoom lens i can frame them better and with the 10.2 mega pixels i can blow them up and frame them . there are dozens ( hundreds ? ) of features that i will grow into , but for now i am delighted to use this camera right out of the box , with just minimal reading of instructions . everything i remember from my 35mm days ( my first camera was a minolta srt-101 that i bought in 1973 ) can be put to use , but what i forget , the camera remembers . my point -- this is a camera that is ready to meet you wherever you are and grow with you should you decide you want to go farther out and deeper in
camera	this was a terrible purchase on my part . it does n't even deserve 1 star . i just wanted a small bag to wear over the shoulder for quick access to my z7590 without holding other equipment or being too bulky . the bag was too small for my z7590 , and i paid $ 8 shipping plus return shipping . i only hope they do n't charge me a re-stocking fee . i went to walmart , found a cute little bag in the electronics dept . that the camera fits great in , with room for the strap and extra memory cards or battery if necessary . they have cute ones for ladies too , with pink polka dots or stripes inside ! for only $ 12 . next time , i 'll be smarter !
camera	bought this about a year ago and now it has a lens cap error ( appears like the shutter never opens ) and will not record video . spoke with jvc and they seemed to know that this is a problem and are having me send it in . will update my rating after i see what is wrong , if they can fix it , if they will stand behind their product . watch for more details . before it failed only complaint i had was it was a little flakey with lighting but otherwise worked okay for the price
camera	this is my first and very expensive entry into digit slr photography . i have used canon point and shoot digital camera previously . i was avoiding dslr 's because i used to rarely use my eos film slr . the convienience of a point and shoot from that experience was overwhelming . unfortunately so are it 's limitations . so back i came , and the only choice though expensive was the eos 5d for it 's full frame sensor ! the pain was reduced by the double rebates . wow ! this is a revelation ! beautifull images , lot of control . i did notice that the af was not as fast as my old elan iie . i was also disappointed that for the price there was a lack of weather sealing . i am not happy with canon for this , but i really appreciate them for making a full frame sensor in a difficult marketable slot as far as their line up was concerned . this camera also needs prime or l lenses , because the sensor will reveal the inadequacies of inferior lenses . this add 's to the cost . this is an exceptional photographic tool that i hope to use to improve my skill as i explore all it 's capabilities
health	such a thoughtful gift . a real treat for those of us living in colder climates - especially in the winter . the warm lotion is truly a treat to dry , itchy winter skin . anyone would love this !
health	this is very soothing for people with arthritis or any kind of injury and makes your hand feel wonderful
health	i tried all the possible creams on the market , cheap and expensive , for my dark circles but this is the only one that worked imediately . i can not live without it , this is a keeper . it stings a little bit , not all the time but it does . it says that it should only be used twice a day but if i 've had a really tiring week and i 'm in a rush to look good i use it up to five six times a day , just a tiny film and with 2 hours between them . i guarantee that in three days you 'll not recognize yourself ( in a good way ) . very important : it tends to dry the skin under the eyes very much so be sure to aplly after a very good cream ( i use pure chamomile cream ) and leave it over night . well , follow my recipe and you 'll shine fast , you 'll see
health	i have owned this pulse meter for approximately 2 weeks and i find it to be accurate , but it takes a while for it to give a reading . the first few times i used it , it took over a minute to tell me my pulse . however , the manual does state that when you become used to the correct positioning of your finger on the sensor it will give a result faster . so far , this is true , as within the last 3 days , i have received readings within 10 seconds consistently . considering the price , it was a good purchase
health	i have used olay regenerist perfecting cream for over a year now . it leaves the skin feeling very soft without feeling greasy and seems to smooth out the skin nicely . it does not have spf protection so for daytime i use a lighter moisturizer with spf over it before applying my foundation . at night it 's all you need
health	this was the first brand of nursing pads i tried . my first few weeks of nursing were very painful and these pads were a bit scratchy . yet after trying several brands of nursing pads , i came back to lansinoh . they are the most absorbent and discreet disposable pad out there and after i had been nursing for a while they ended up being the most comfortable . the best deal i have found has been amazon 's price for 3 boxes .
health	i bought this iron for my teen daughters - actually i bought it twice , since i did n't have much choice where i was shopping . both times it died . the first iron lasted about 6 months , and the second lasted 2 weeks ! just dies , no warning . my girls are begging me to buy them a decent straightener that is not a conair ! i am going to invest in a better one this time and am doing a lot of research
health	i have owned and broken most grabbers on the market . the fold-up gopher is a joke , another , with a flimsy wire down the center breaks after too much use , and the heavy-duty unit from lowes is hard on the wrist . this unit is the smart way to go ! it is strong and durable and makes the most sense in the way it utilizes the strength of the hand and fingers and relieves pressure from the wrist . also , it is exactly the correct length for a six foot man . no bending at the lumbar required
health	i have had a number of surgeries and injuries over the years . i see a chiropracter and a physical therapist every few weeks . both of them work wonders , but then my body tightens up . i ca n't afford to see them every day ! i bought the theracane because i saw someone else with one at a long distance cycling event . now i 've purchased another 3 to share with friends . it works ! this tool has helped me stay loose , and has taken away a lot of the shoulder stiffness that i have suffered for the past 7 years . i suggest the addition of the trigger point therapy workbook , which will give you a lot of the details about the body and why/where it hurts . but even if you do n't want to study , you can still get lots of benefits from daily use of the theracane
health	if you get it wet it stops working , which is quite ironic given its a toothbrush . if you want something to work for a month or two its fine , otherwise avoid it entirely . i intitally thought the water was effecting the battery compartment but after cleaing the contacts and replacing the batteries it seems clear to me that the motor fails due to moisture , pretty quickly after ordinary use
health	i came across the hooah drink because my boss -- a retired military man running for office -- always has a case lying around . with campaign season heating up and workdays getting crazy long , these are invaluable for getting me through the day , and keeping my thoughts coherent . apparently military studies said these drinks improve alertness by fifty percent . i ca n't measure that in myself of course , but i do sense a dramatic improvement
health	i bought this product because i had a borderline high reading at my doctor 's office . rather than having the hassle of going to his office and paying a cop-pay just to have it monitored , we purchased this unit . it works wonderful . very simple and gives more information than i expected
health	i was quite pleased with this alarm clock until recently when i found that it was consistently waking me up one hour early . i tried fiddling with the dst setting and then changing the alarm and clock times just a little but without fail it would wake me an hour earlier than i wanted . the brightness may be a problem for some people but i found it reasonable . overall a good docking station , but a poor alarm clock
health	i have used opti-free enzymatic cleaner for years , still with the same great results . i have a feeling this type of product wo n't be around much longer , because my using extended-wear contacts seems to be a rarity at my optometrist 's office , where everyone else is wearing the disposal lenses that are always in stock
health	i absolutely love this stuff . i would recommend this to any person that has frizz . it makes my hair feel so silky smoothe . i started using it about 2 months ago and can not stand to go without it . just use a little because it can make your hair look oily if you use too much and do n't put it close to the scalp either for the same reason . i tried the chi silk infusion because i thought they would be the same since they are both made by farouk but the chi is not nearly as good . i would give this 100 stars i could .
health	i eat one of these twice a week before i play ice hockey . i specifically buy this flavor because it contains caffeine , though i do n't perceive any `` boost '' . it could be there and i 'm just not noticing it . i feel they do the job of keeping me fueled for the workout . it would be nice if the package made a specific recommendation about how long before a workout to eat the clif bar . i find the size of a clif bar a bit disappointing , especially considering the `` store '' price of $ 1.50 . at $ 11 a case and with free shipping when spending $ 25 or more , i 've not found a better price than amazon 's on clif bars
health	absolute waste of money , this is not a pillow as advertised , in my opinion falsely , but a flat mat which , when filled with water is a very heavy weight and it is not possible to sleep on this . you could use it to wipe your feet on but thats all . an extremely disappointed customer who suffers from overheating badly in bed and thought this was a great solution . now out of pocket and no better off .
health	i bought this apple humidifier in early november . it stopped working soon at the first time i used it . i later found out that there was no water exchange unless you shake it or move it so that it might continue to work for a while and then stopped again . you have to repeat the above steps in order to keep it working . i contacted the manufacturer and got replacement . however , the new one has the same problem , and what 's worse , it leaks ! ! i talked to the manufacturer again , but they did n't think there should be such problem and refused to do anything else . now i have to keep this defected machine and have no idea what to do
health	i am a big fan of 2 '' curling irons , but they can be difficult to find . my last one ( different brand ) wore out a couple years ago and i had a hard time finding a replacement until now . i have shoulder length hair , fairly thick , plus wavy and frizzy . 2 '' curling irons do a great job of smoothing and straightening my hair , while also turning it under ( or up , if desired ) at the ends for a nice , finished look . i find it much easier and faster than using a traditional flat/straight iron while achieving superior results . you will not get `` curl '' with this curling iron . you will get smooth hair quickly and easily . highly recommended
health	there is no way to keep this product in place in the mouth other than by keeping pressure on it with your teeth . this defeats the purpose of a product that is supposed to help reduce the grinding and clenching of teeth . very disappointing .
health	skip this entire product . i made the mistake of purchasing it and stocked up on the scrubbing and non-scrubbing ( mopping ? ) pads . now , i ca n't find the non-scrubbing ones anywhere in my entire county . i think they do n't want to compete with their own product `` swiffer '' which they also manufacture . i emailed them and they suggested i buy online . i checked walgreens.com and drugstore.com and no luck . i imagine they will phase this out and you will be stuck with a wasteful `` who gives a hoot '' rod .
health	i use this with my m3 turbo and some kiehl 's closeshavers squadron ultimate brushless shave cream white eagle for my daily morning shave . it 's the best combination for thick tough stubble .
health	the drywalls in my house apparently have some insulation blown into them , and i could not get the hooks to work . i finally did get one in place and hung a medium large picture on it , and it failed . far short of the maximum weight on the package . in all fariness the walls were not the right kind of walls and i think whey would work fine for small and medium pics . the laser tool that was included is neat and i used it for all of my pictures , which i had to hang with other hardware
health	i boutght this razor for my husband . he likes it , but notes that it is hard to clean and does not get the longer whiskers , which he seems to miss a lot . i think that if he shaved more carefully , he would get these whiskers before they get too long ! i think that for the price ( lower end of price range ) , it does a pretty good job . next time , i 'll buy him a more expensive one and hope that it performs better .
health	i love this soap , it 's a little big and hard to hold during shower , but the smell totally makes up for it ! it has a very strong ( but good ) grapefruit smell , it 's very fresh and rinses completely off
health	so i bought two of these bottles , got them home , and discovered the first time i used them that every time you take a sip of water , they squeal like a drowning mouse . it was unbelievably embarassing . the store refused to take them back , so i contacted the company directly ... and ended up in a back-and-forth email exchange with an extremely rude person in customer servide who insisted i was wrong , that the bottles did n't squeal and i was just using them incorrectly . she offered to replace the caps after i wrote back and explained that it was a water bottle , for god 's sake , `` using '' it was n't exactly rocket science . but she 'd only replace them at my expense , which after shipping worked out to be almost what the bottles originally cost . do not buy these bottles ! try one of the fine products at gaiam or new wave enviro
health	owned for 2.5 years . finaly broken . `` the conair often feels as if it is pulling your hair rather than cut it '' - totaly agree
health	they are a waste of time and money . they put goo in your mouth and not as much on your teeth . after a week , my teeth are the same color as when i started
health	back in the early 90s i was going through a bad acne period . i finally visited a dermatologist , and he put me on an accutane regimen . i had sensitive skin and a tough beard , so regular shaving cream was too harsh ( especially while taking accutane - the solid brush-on cream i was using at the time burned the edges of my lips ) . he recommended that i shave with cetaphil . years later , my skin and beard are still troublesome . therefore , i 've kept cetaphil as a part of my shaving regimen . cetaphil goes on well and provides a nice lubrication for my shaver . it 's not harsh or irritating , even on a freshly shaved face . however , it 's kind of cold in the morning , which is a bit counter-productive after heating my face with hot water and shower steam to soften the whiskers . so i put the bottle on the tub floor while showering to heat it up with the runoff . by the time i 'm done , it 's warm enough for application after rubbing some around my hands for a second or two . however , even though cetaphil feels good and lubricates well , its consistency is a bit thin to use alone . i like a good lather , so i combine cetaphil with kiss my face moisture shave , which was recommended to me by a woman working at gnc . they mix well together , and i get a good , non-irritating shave by using the gillette fusion power razor . for post-shave comfort and to prevent breakouts , i apply a product that contains salicylic acid , such as clean dual-action oil-free moisturizing lotion . if you have a razor-challenging beard and skin combination like me , then make cetaphil part of your shaving routine . recommended
health	flax is a plant . the seeds in the flax plant are filled with flaxseed oil , ( sometimes called linseed oil ) . the seeds contain fatty oils called alpha-linolenic acid ( ala ) and linoleic acid . ala is the omega-3 oil in flaxseed . flaxseed contains both omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids . flaxseed is nature 's richest storehouse of omega-3 fatty acids , and contains more than twice as much omega-3 oil as fish oils , and it costs less , ounce for ounce . flax also contains other important substances like lignans , which may protect against some types of cancer . the husks of the seeds are rich in mucilage . both the seed oil and mucilage have many nutritional and therapeutic properties . there are many potential benefits from taking flax seed oil : flaxseed oil lowers cholesterol levels , thereby improving cardiovascular health and lessening the risk of arteriosclerosis . flaxseed also contains plant nutrients like phytoestrogens . these are natural estrogen-like substances that can lessen the discomfort of menopause . flaxseed oil may lower high blood pressure . flaxseed oil helps some people improve their psoriasis and eczema , as it has anti-inflammatory properties . flaxseed may also reduce the itching , swelling , and redness associated with certain skin disorders such as acne . flaxseed oil has a positive effect on rheumatoid arthritis due to its ability to calm inflammation . flaxseed reduces ldl ( low-density lipoprotein ) cholesterol ( the body 's `` bad cholesterol '' ) and lowers triglyceride levels . research shows that flaxseed oil gives much better protection against heart attacks than canola oil or olive oil . taking flaxseed may reduce cancer risk . this is because flaxseed contains the richest sources of lignan building blocks , which play a major role in preventing cardiovascular diseases and cancer . new research indicates that the lignans in flaxseed have both short-term and long-term protective effects against colon cancer . nature made flaxseed oil is a quality source of flaxseed oil , as the company is well-known and reputable . one tip : keep your flaxseed oil away from light and heat , as both degrade the oil . the usual beneficial dose of flaxseed oil is 2-3 capsules once per day taken with a meal . jim `` konedog '' koenig
health	before you buy , be sure to check where the pen was made . i have a number of older cross pens that say `` usa '' near the top , and they are great pens . however , i have bought three different ones in the past few years that do not indicate where they were made , and they are of inferior quality . the top and bottom halves are loose , and have to be carefully manipulated to come together without a gap . the first one i got , i sent it back to cross for warranty repair under their `` lifetime guarantee , '' only to receive it back unchanged telling me that it was just fine - and a `` handling fee '' attached . i was willing to believe it was simply an anomaly , one bad pen . so later on when some new colors came out , i bought two more - only to see that they have the same quality defect . my advice : if you want a good cross pen , go to the secondhand store and buy one that was made in usa . they are n't making them the same anymore .
health	i 've only used the unit 3 times , and the flip-over trimmer broke when i `` flipped '' it over to attach to the main clipper head . the plastic attachment for the flip over trimmer is supposed to fit over the main head , that cracked in two , and about 8 pieces scattered on the floor . it 's very disappointing . i 'm hoping the rest of the unti will perform for longer , i ca n't seem to find the receipt
health	excellent product . works well . only problem is that the container holding water could be bigger
health	the oral-b is a good product but the refills certainly are n't worth what they charge for them . i do n't know about you but it has always annoyed me when you get held hostage by a company to buy their refills for the item they sold you at a rip-off price . they could make a great profit selling these refills at something like $ 2.50 each , their rip off price of $ 8.50 ea is beyond absurd . the other thing is that when you buy their toothbrush they have something in there like the brush heads last 2 months . that 's a real laugh . even brushing just once a day , you 're lucky if you get a month out of them . so not only do they rip you off with their refill cost , they also lie to you to get you locked into their product to begin with
health	i bought this obus forme king sized pillow because i thought it might stop my snoring . i must admit to being surprised that the pillow actually did minimize my night time rattling if not eliminate it completely . there have been reviews that mentioned the pillow had a strange odor at first . i found that it did give off a smell similar to that of a new carpet or some plastics , but that disappeared in just a few days and was never offensive . my wife wanted to try my pillow and liked it so much she kept it . i have just ordered a second pillow .
health	this protein is unbelievable . i have tried *many* different brands/varieties and this is without a doubt one of the best out there . it does n't have the characteristic nausiating whey smell or taste , it 's not too sweet , mixes lump-free in cold or piping hot water and packs a punch with 23g of easily digestable protein per scoop . once you try it , this stuff will definitely become a staple in your pantry .
health	very light electric razor . cuts shaving time from 10 minutes down to 3 minutes . so a charge for 30 minutes of shaving time easily lasts a week . when running it is as quiet as an old fashioned blade . does a great job very quickly and smoothly . you do n't need anything more
health	i bought one last year as it was supposed to be accurate and you could do it yourself . doing it yourself is misleading as the directions for one of measuring sites for women require you to hold it in your right hand and measure the back of your right tricep . impossible to do both at the same time . even with the help of my trainer who is skilled at using calipers it gave widely variable readings and inconsistant results . the feature that takes your % body fat and classifies your level by age never worked . mine was stuck making the classification by the youngest age group for women . basically it ignored specific data entered in for age and male/female . i was very disappointed but was fortunate to get my money back
health	i purchased the mitts for a gift and also for myself . the person for whom i purchased them is very happy with them and so am i. i was looking for a mitt that could keep my hands as hot as possible because i have arthritis and was surprised that the heat stays for more than 1 hour . it is too soon to tell but i hope it will help me with the arthritis in my hands .
health	if you do n't like getting attention , these are not for you . i 'm often surprised by people 's astonished reactions to the act of putting them on and taking them off ; i 'm so accustomed to pulling them apart , that i forget how unusual the viewing public finds it . i have been wearing clics for nearly a year . i pretend that i do n't need glasses , but of course i do and have for nearly a decade . popped the standard diopter lenses out , and put in my bifocal prescription . it worked great , despite a warning from my optical shop . ( and even if they had broken from the experiment , the price is right : i could try it again . ) previously i was wearing glasses on a chain . besides the various difficulties noted by another reviewer , i also found that the plastic loops that connect the chain to the arms of the glasses have a bad habit of stretching . then the glasses slip off the chain at inappropriate times and the frames break . i call the color of mine `` magenta '' - which may or may not be the same as the online `` red '' - i bought them in a shop ( **gasp** ) . my short hair is not a problem , but i agree that reading in bed does n't work . so i use a different pair for those occasions
health	i found this blood pressure meter easy to use and quite accurate when checked against my doctors readings . keeping the readings in memory made it very easy to keep my doctor inform of the results . the size of the cuff is very important , so be sure to order the right size for your arm as the wrong size will give inaccurate results . this is true in the doctors office also . my blood pressure dropped several points in the doctors office , on his machine , just by changing the size of the cuff . this is an excellent monitor - i could n't be happier with it . it is nice to be able to use it with batteries too .
health	i bought this one because it had 4 settings instead of three - so i thought one of them might actually be hot . instead , the highest setting is warm to the touch - not hot . this may be a `` lawsuit friendly '' reality with heating pads today - i 've yet to find one as good as my old one that died 2 years ago ( i had that one for 10+ years , the sunbeam replacement i bought prior to this one lasted 2 and was n't hot ) .
health	no moving parts contrary to depiction above . the `` attachments '' are tiny plastic 1.5 '' knobs that attach to a motionless center peg over which you are supposed to rub your feet ! they do not move . there is no massaging action - you do all the work , making your hips and knees sore . the `` massaging foot beds '' are totally motionless and form a spiky , painful surface . vibration setting creates an annoying buzzing sensation over whole device . jets are totally underpowered . no fill line indicator so `` bubbles '' spill water onto floor . heater is completely useless - after 15 minutes water temp was no different . can not return because water ruins loofa and epsom salt pads . classic deception in advertising
health	i owned this set for about 2 and a half years before i finally just gave up and switched to a different brand of hot rollers ( i used it about 4-5 times per year ) . first off , the rollers are very heavy so when you have them all in place , it feels like you are carrying a laundry basket on your head . second , the rollers are hot to the touch so burning can be an issue when rolling up your hair . third , the clips used to hold the rollers in place are fantastically difficult to use . i would roll up my hair ( which would take like , 30 minutes because of the difficulty ) , and if i walked around the house to watch tv while i waited for my hair to set , the clips would spring out of place and shoot across the room . i eventually lost like 6 clips from the `` springing out '' thing . the results of these rollers were great , though . i used them on my wedding day and people loved it . good results , but not worth the time and effort to use these rollers
health	i recently purchased the obus forme lowback backrest , along with the seat cushion . although i have heard people rave about the excellent support , and they felt comfortable enough to me , i ca n't give them more than 2 stars . the material used in their construction drove me to distraction . this is obviously a personal preference type of thing . other folks may have no issues with the material at all . these are just my feelings on the matter : i found the texture of the fabric to be a little rough and it did n't allow easy movement when sitting on/leaning against it , which would drive me crazy after just a few hours at work . also , when making any movements , the compression of the foam , and the friction between it and the fabric covering , made really annoying noises . it reminded me somewhat of snow compressing down when walking on it . the backrest was even worse than the seat cushion because it had a thin plastic wrapping ( looked sort of like shrink wrap or saran wrap ) around the foam inside , which made loud crinkling noises every time i even twitched . it was awful ! however good the science behind the backrest and cushion is , the sound effects and unpleasant texture were distracting enough , to me at least , to return both items .
health	this is a useful tool in that it makes the software/hardware combination available at a less expensive price than any other i am aware of . my only criticism is that there is not a lot of information on interpretation of the output , although from reading heart math literature one can get a sense of what one is doing . however for the price it is definitely worth it and i could see that some people may want to get the game mostly for the option of having this expansion pack
health	i purchased this item because of the trustworthy name and cordless feature . the positive reviews here are from first impressions . however , i have had this clipper close to a year but with probably less then 5 hours use . when i first received it , it felt very light and cheaply made . i gave it the benifit of the doubt and hoped for the best . last time it worked , the motor slowed down to almost a halt . i keep it cleaned and oiled . the motor is just too cheap . im not sure what the company wahl was thinking when they made this product . they should really consider discontinueing this model because it is hurting their image . i would not even attempt to use my warranty because it 's not defected parts . it 's a total lemon . it would be nice if they will let me exchange it for a different model or full refund . i would even pay the difference . i do not recommend this product
health	it seems to be doing the job ... .my next dental check will tell . it 's a little awkward at first getting used to the brush ( quite a bit different from the conventional brush ) ; and i think though they tell you to hold the handle with two fingers only ( thumb and forefinger ) that you do have to tilt the brush a little to get the gumline . and i still do find a little tartar on my teeth . so , you decide
health	works great but i wish i could find it in stores . the one riteaid that does carry it , does n't always have it in stock . i also can not always find it in just any rite aid . some do n't carry it at all ... annoying ! my daughter is the canker sore sufferer . i did some research before i discovered rembrandt , and found that the ingredient , sodium lauryl sulfate , found in almost all toothepastes is the culprate . rembrandt for canker sores does not contain this key ingredient . sodium lauryl sulfate ( sls ) is what makes our toothepaste foam . my daughter hardly ever has anymore canker sore breakouts . if she does , it seems to be from getting a cold . try and find a toothpaste without sls ... they are n't out there . it would be nice to have some competition to bring the price down and be more readily available . but all in all , i 'm glad someone has made this product available , even if it 's pricey and hard to find .
health	this works best for me . i do n't like a wet or greasy look . this holds well , then dries as if nothing is on the hair . without it , my hair falls down into my eyes . i think it 's the best
health	this sinus rinse works great and it 's easy to use . great price from amazon and quick shipping
health	this razor is not worth the money . it did shave pretty well for a few months , but the rubber strips wear out really quickly . and , even though the `` cleaning option '' with the fluid seems like a great idea ... it does not work very well ... the razor was never clean ... and refilling the fluid is just a pain ... i would not recommend this razor
health	recommend it . suppressed my appetite the first day . when i got hungry it took a few bytes to feel full again
health	this item is very heavy and bulky . descriptions give you the idea that your feet will endure the `` kneading '' action as well as your calves ; however that is not the case . your feet only rest on these two painful round balls that only vibrate should you wish them too . the `` kneading '' pressure can not be regulated , only the speed . the `` kneading '' pressure is very intense and can be very uncomfortable at times . if my massage therapist ever worked like this i would fire immediately . i tired to like it , however quickly returned after a few days
health	i ordered the happylite about 4 months before they even shipped the product , because it was the first reasonably priced ( and sized ) light to help treat sad . living in minnesota , i tend to get depressed in february , so wanted to see if the light would help . starting in oct/nov 2003 , i began turning it on at desk height at my work for the suggested amount of time . i did not use it on weekends . anyway , i think that it helped me keep from sinking so low with the sad blues in february , but it did not completely keep sad away . i spent 4 days on the beach in florida during the 3rd week of february , and that helped the most . i will indeed use the light again this winter , because it helps -- but does not eliminate -- sad for me
health	maybe because i ordered a `` medium '' . it works fine otherwise . i recommend it
health	these are a great , yuumy snack . for someone who counts calories ( or points ) , it 's nice to have an option that is relatively healthy and still tastes great ! i have never met a luna bar i did n't like , though this is my favorite flavor
health	to start - i miss my hair . last september i cut my hip length hair to mid back , and then in december to just at the shoulders , and then again to the chin in january - and from january through june i trimmed it regularly to keep it that length . ( i 've been getting rid of the henna that was in my hair - i could n't get it out via any other method tried except `` growing out '' ) . my hair grows kinda slow now too - it used to grow faster , but i suppose everything slows down the older you get . my last cut was late june - and it was at mid to upper neck length - basically a little bit longer than the chin length cut , and then layered . that got rid of the really saturated henna 'd hair - so i was ready to start growing it out . after much digging around online i came across hair 37 and all the reviews on it - both good and bad . i gave it a shot - got my pills in the first week of july and started taking them . last night - maybe it was wishful thinking , but i noticed a difference in the hair length - it seemed it 'd picked up a little length a little extra quickly - and then my boyfriend commented on it later that day . he knows i 've been working to go back to my natural hair color - and there 's a noticeable demarcation line from the henna and the natural hair color . last night he looked at me and said `` hey wow - you 're hair 's really grown - i can see a half inch more of the roots ! wow - you 're hair is getting dark ! '' i was pretty pleased with that - not bad for just 2 weeks on the vitamins ! i ca n't wait to see how it is in another 2 weeks , come august - if i have another 1/2 inch to add to it , i will definitely be reordering these pills ! but a side note , from previous reviews and my own experience ... it 's a lot of pills to take - but make sure you keep up with them every day . i find taken a stage one pill at morning and afternoon , and then dividing up the stage 2 pills into 3 doses of 2 pills throughout the day works very well .
health	i rate ( green tea fat burner ) 5 star . because i bot another called lipoxinol 70.00 ) and i bot another one called ( green tea fat furner ) and it was better in quality wise and its only 14.99 at costco . lipoxinol is very good as well but more expesive . bot off amazon.it sais its ( made canada ) derctions say to take 4 pills in am 4pills pm . and man there great . the ( green tea fat burners ) in comparison dictions say take 2 pillsam 2pills pm . i over rall i think ( green tea fat burner ) makes me a little bit more hyper . the more hyper the more stuff i do , that means the more excerise i get , , , , , you will see lipoxinal on amazon . its 4 star , this one has less rating for some reason , not many people said much about it , wierd , americans like to pay more money when , this one can work just as great , not all work tho , but like i said this one was great for me in wise , i bot both , dont go off telling every one u are taking weight loss pills because people will get worryed , like theres no problem , people drink coffee every day of there life , i told my mom and she thot i was crazy , but what dose my mom know , she never tryed weight loss pills , i tryed ntoher one from the natral food store call mini skiny fat burner and i felt like i just shot my self with cocane , so be carfull , earbs have been used for thousand of years and can make u drug crazy ,
health	this is the longest period of time that my husband has kept a pair of reading glasses . the click readers loop around his neck and are always there when he needs them . he gets lots of comments about how neat they are
health	i returned this biofeedback software and hardware . i was happy with amazon 's quick credit back to my credit card , but i found this purchase totally lacking . the games it had you play were boring and i would n't suggest buying this for doing biofeedback
health	i read in one of the magazines , that many stars in hollywood eat chocolate to lose weight . i thought , that was some kind of cruel joke , until i read that the chocolate they eat is with hoodia , but i could not find the name for those chocolates . i searched the internet , and was i happy to find chocoleans ! i was going out on a date to my favorite sushi place , and had one chocolean before i left the house . it worked ! i could barely finish two sushi 's and i felt soo full . now i eat one or two chocoleans a day with water or coffee , and eat soo much less ! i already lost two dress sizes , amazing . and , they are sooo delicious
health	this is exactly what i wanted -- the last 1 i bought is over 10 yrs old and still going -- i was afraid each day it would go out and could not find a replacement anywhere -- -you are a life -- i mean , hair saver ! ! diane in texa
health	i have to say i am disappointed , having used a trimmer from wahl with same model number 9916 , which i felt gave me a good trim , i immediately sought out to buy same model off amazon . the one i received was much cheaper in quality . the plastic guide is cheap junk which felt like it would break eventually , which it did within 3 weeks from being dropped . the guide shattered . there is no replacement for the 5-position guide for the 9916 i can find . now i am torn between buying another of these and treating it like a precious heirloom , or finding a razor that can survive real world use . on the plus side , the battery life on this razor is incredible .
health	the first one of these i received broke after 2 uses . target.com quickly sent a replacement at no charge , and now that one has broken after about 5 uses . very frustrating , because otherwise it seems like a good system
health	the magnet is solid , the frame wiggle perfectly to make it clic and fit just like the picture shows . lenses are clear and functional . however , they need to give a bit more space to accomodate larger heads , since it can get snug and this is not your usual glasses . notice that the frame encircles the head , making head size an issue . on the plus side- the glasses wo n't fall off when you bend forward , they stay around your neck after you unclick 'em , and they are functional
health	bought this for use by my husband while he was in a nursing home and i used it to shave and cut his hair with while he was there , no hair on him or pillows or sheets . this is wonderful for anyone that does not want a mess while trimming or cutting hair , i also used it on the tougher part of his beard . wonderful item
health	these never leak and are good enough to wear over night . this is the only diaper i buy
health	used to have a lot of liquid soap and shampoo get washed down the drain by my two kids ... kids will be kids ... but now they really like having their own dispenser buttons to push . easy to mount and easy to use
health	very good ; very satisfying . interesting blend of flavors -- dried fruit , cocoa , chili . nothing dominates - all the flavors are well balanced to make it interesting to eat . i could n't eat one every day , but for an occasional meal replacement , it is very good . too high calorie to be a snack item , but it 's tempting
health	i bought it 15 days back and it broke when i am chopping onion.. but its great to cut soft vegetables and even carrot is also good.. but i couldnt cut onions as mentioned.. probably we have to buy the onions from them hahhahaha ... i dont suggest buying it for onions.. coz i bought only for onions so that i could save my tears
health	i purchased the sound therapy radio to take on a trip . my roommate is a snorer , and i figured i needed the sound . i tried it out at home and liked it . it has a good variety of sounds and is easy to figue out how to use . the alarm and clock are added goodies for me as i was looking for a sound machine that was small and light enough for travel . it was a good buy for my purposes .
health	this is n't a bad dryer when it comes to convenience and travelling . however , the folding handle did eventually break and i had to modify it to hold it together . i have n't noticed any benefit from the ion control , mine and my wife 's hair get 's easily frizzled with this dryer , plus it takes a long time to dry in comparison to what others have claimed . the switch is definitely very difficult to use , there 's no way a person can use it with one hand . if you tried , you 'd end up dropping the thing . the fact that the off position is between the two speed settings is n't very good either because you push so hard to move the switch you simply move from high to low instead of to the off position . personally , i ca n't wait to find her a better one so i can tear this one apart for more interesting things . on the upside , after fixing the handle , it has worked without any real problems for 6 months
health	i 've been taking these for over 3 weeks.. i have not seen any new hair growth . i think that new hair that does grow will be stronger but this has not caused my hair to grow any faster . i would suggest just buying hair supplement vitamins from gnc or any other place you can find them . they are much less expensive
health	i had this for about 2 years , and was not impressed . it worked for a month or so , and since then , does nothing . if you fill it up with water , and then plug it in for several days , the water level never goes down . i 've tried cleaning it repeatedly , and tried various things to make it work , but apparently it 's just dead . it was a cheap product ; you get what you pay for
health	its a nice little trimmer and not cumbersome at all like the remington trimmers . it has a cheap little organizer but as long as your not rough with it , it shouldnt break . another benefit is that you can rinse all the attachments under hot water in addition to brushing the hair out prior to that to ensure a very clean trimmer . just remember folks this is a trimmer not a wet blade or electric razor..it will leave a very fine layer of stubble which is fine by me . a man can still look neat if he shapes up the facial hair before reducing it to fine stubble . my shaving experience with this thing is pleasant ... it does not pull hairs which is very refreshing for a trimmer . the only other device i never had/have that problem with is my braun 360 complete ( parts of the year i shave , other parts of the year i trim ) . its a very nice package and efficient . the only drawback is that it seems fragile ... so be careful not to drop any part of this set
health	unfortunately total block did not work well with my rosacea sensitive skin . it caused my skin to become very red and irritated by the end of the day . i do n't doubt this is an excellent sunblock , just not for my rosacea sensitive skin . i use it now on my arms with no problems . i do feel it is very expensive for so little product so will not repurchase
health	i thought this was convenient and easy to use . seemed to give a pretty accurate reading .
health	i had this unit for about 6 months and it broke on me . if it had n't broke , i 'll give if 4 stars
health	first , this is a big and cumbersome ... . but second , this is the best foot spa . got it for the wife and had to try it myself . i am a wuss when it comes to super hot temps and i had to ease into the heat , it stayed hot the entire time . the jets were nice and the wireless remote is priceless ( just make sure its in your hand when you sit down so you do n't have to move an inch : ) ) . the rollers on the bottom are nice too . it gets loud when on high-jets mode , but nothing to grand . fast shipper , would recommend
health	i have been using this shaver for 2 weeks now and have not had any problems with it . it is easy to use and clean i have only had to charge it once so far . even though this is my first electric shaver , it is a good deal for the money . it does n't shave as close as a razor but it 's close . i would recommend it or give it as a gift .
health	returned item , as was leaking all over . great product if amazon had packed it better , i could have used it
health	calvin klein 's obsession was one of the earliest releases in the designer fragrance craze , and it has since become a classic . obsession is a warm , earthy , sensual scent . there is no floral or sweetness to it ; rather , it has a musky , almost masculine quality with a bit of a vanilla note . the scent is gently seductive -- alluring enough for romance , but also subtle enough for everyday wear . in has excellent staying power , as it lingers on the skin all day long . although obession has all of the qualities i usually like in a fragrance -- i definitely prefer musky , spicy scents to more floral ones -- for some reason , obsession is not one of my favorites ; although i do enjoy wearing it on occasion , i actually prefer stealing some of my husband 's obession for men to wear for myself ! overall , however , obsession for women is a classic fragrance that i would definitely recommend
health	this product is great at exfoliating , not so great at hair removal . your skin will be silky smooth , but still have hair . the hair that is removed does n't stay gone long . and it 's tricky to maneuver into the curvier parts of your body . it will definitely have to be used in conjunction with another product .
health	do n't waste your money on this size . go ahead and get the 19 x 39 towel . the absorbency is good but there 's no way it will fit around a head . also , i 'm not sure what to do with the snap that is attached either
health	these did nothing for me . ask your doctor about aphthasol , a prescription drug approved by the fda -- which means it 's passed rigorous government testing standards . aphthasol changed my life
health	this is a good little product . did not expect much , but in fact it helped me relax and fall asleep and stay asleep . - thank
health	this item is great . it holds shampoo and conditioner , or whatever liquids you need in the shower , and also has a handy basket that i use to keep the shower spray cleaner and my shaving cream . the handy hooks hold my razor and my washcloth . really cuts down on the clutter and puts everything in one place . however , i had to buy this item from another vendor because amazon kept delaying shipment . after the delays had exceeded a month , i finally cancelled my order and went elsewhere . good product , bad transaction
health	i just received my brush ( es ) hair dryer yesterday 3/9/07 ... tried it out today - for 5 minutes ... i absolutely hate it . it 's the worst , by far , hair appliance i 've ever owned . i guess you get what you pay for ... but i 've owned revlon products in the past , and this was absolutely the biggest waste of money . i can not return it , because the return cost would be too expensive , too much trouble , and i guess it will go in the dumpster . i hate it - do n't make the same mistake i made . one big problem is that the bristles are so lousy - not firm and does n't grip the hair . just take it from this written testimony - it 's a piece of junk
health	the scale is everything the manufacturer claims . however , with minimal use by one average sized adult , our scale lasted only about nine months . the balance part of the scale is very sound , but the battery clip that powers the electronics is poorly designed and built of very cheap components . i suspect that poor q will result in a fairly high percentage of these units failing and recommend that you go elsewhere . today , my scale will not function unless i hold the batteries by hand ( not too practical when someone is standing on it ... ) . conclusions : * scale design is nice -- looks good . * construction of balance components is solid , glass is very strong . design and construction of the power unit ( battery ) is rather poor . * scale functions as advertised for a normal sized ( 80kg/175lb ) adult ... until the battery power clip dies . * buyers should avoid this scale in favor of something with more solid battery compartment and connections . hope this helps !
health	pedometer is great ! easy to use , accurate . highly recommend it
health	picked this up to try out because of the ratings price . did n't do a thing for me . wipe it on , let it haze and wipe it off . no difference .
health	i got this for my daughter for christmas . she loves it . she is able to do her nail easily . the nail attachments work really well and strong , the only thing the attachments for callous do not really work that well they have to be at a certain angle and work so so , but the rest of the attachments are excellent certainly worth the price for those alone.compact size , easy to store and quick charge time
health	this scale does not weigh correctly . your results depend upon exactly where you are standing on the scale when you are weighing in . i counted 6 different results within 5 minutes the last time i used it . this is one of the least accurate scales i 've ever used . spend the extra money to get a higher quality non-digital scale
health	i 've only used the kit once , and it did what it was supposed to . no problems , everything went fine , and i intend to use it again within about a month . it should pay for itself very quickly
health	lcd fell off when arrived because the two-side sticker was n't stong enough . anyhow , i could push it back . then , the scale could n't be turned on by tapping on the top . this is the only way you can make this scale work as discribed on manual . i have to remove and insert battery to turn it on everytime ! i think some force sensor attached to the frame is broken . this is the problem i ca n't fix . the only thing i can do is sending it back . following up : according to the other review , i tried to make this scale `` vibrating '' using different ways of tapping . it did n't work no matter how hard i tried . i had to use my toe to lift up one side a little ( about half an inch ) and drop it on hard floor to make enough `` vibration '' to turn it on . i wonder how long this scale can function well by such a way to switch on . my soehnle scale always turns on by a soft tapping . i have to admit the reading of this scale is very clear and accurate . just feel a little nervous standing on two pieces of glass . and also , be careful to use it in bathroom : moisture will make the glass surface slippery .
health	this pitcher is designed so that when you try to empty it -- pour out all the water -- the filter comes crashing out ! it 's top-heavy . i much prefer my dispenser that lives in the fridge . it may be clumsy to refill -- which is why i thought i 'd try a pitcher -- but it 's extremely easy to use
health	unfortunately , millions of americans currently suffer from the debilitating effects of stress , anxiety , and depression . in the pharmaceutical industry , anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants are among the best-selling medications on the market . the everyday stressors faced by americans have simply become too much for many to bear , and reasonably so . in recent years , taking an anti-anxiety medication or antidepressant has become as common as taking a multivitamin . however , the side effects and long-term effects of such medications were for the most part unknown until recently . in the past year , some of the drastic negative effects of such medications have come to light , much to the horror of patients and physicians alike . anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants have been linked to addiction , severe withdrawal , weight gain , vertigo , and even suicide and death . to treat the symptoms of stress , anxiety , and depression , without negative health implications , many are now turning to natural supplements -- safely and with much success . most consumers are confused about which natural stress , anxiety , and depression supplements to take . fortunately , there are now a few promising natural supplements on the market which offer truly effective results , safely . the challenge lies in distinguishing the effective products from the one 's that are based more on marketing hype . it is critical that the product you choose contains those ingredients proven effective for treatment through clinical study , and that those ingredients are of the highest grade and included in the proper dosage in the product . this is the key to getting the results you desire - freedom from stress , anxiety , and depression . after researching nearly every available natural anxiety product on the market today i can tell you that many products contain low-grade ingredients in amounts far too small to be truly effective . there are a few , however , with clinical research behind them that also contain quality ingredients in efficacious doses . these products offer the definite potential to counter your emotional and physical responses to stress , anxiety , and depression . after review of the products and the available scientific literature only those products that met the criteria were recommended , here is a list of the top the top 10 stress , anxiety and depression supplements on the market today : 1 ) anxietol 7 ( tm ) 2 ) welatonin ( tm ) 3 ) pinadol ( tm ) 4 ) seredyn ( tm ) 5 ) prosera ( tm ) 6 ) amoryn ( tm ) 7 ) euphorx ( tm ) 8 ) herbval supra ( tm ) 9 ) clarocet-nri ( tm ) 10 ) relora ( tm )
health	thought this would work , should have known better.a pen light would do the same thing.do not waste your money , or you will look as silly as me.i returned the piece of jun
health	this was my heating pad , but my hairless cat took it over . he has a special pet heating pad of his own that he loved until he discovered this one . the first day i could n't pry him off . i love that it 's washable . in fact , i 'm getting a second one for him to use while the others in the wash. of course , i keep it pretty low for him . being able to choose the times for shutoff is nice too since a lot of heating pads shutoff in two hours and some days that 's not enough .
health	i was never able to use this mirror successfully due to its low light source . agree with other users -- this mirror was no better than an unlighted one .
health	i use it for the water pic function in addition to the sinus rinse tool i purchased . works great !
health	my husband purchased the pedometer with fm radio for me . i loved it and used it non-stop for about a week . after a week the battery case top fell off so i could not keep the batteries in . the fm radio worked only once - i thought i had a short in the headset . good idea but really did not perform/last for the money
health	flax is a plant . the seeds in the flax plant are filled with flaxseed oil , ( sometimes called linseed oil ) . the seeds contain fatty oils called alpha-linolenic acid ( ala ) and linoleic acid . ala is the omega-3 oil in flaxseed . flaxseed contains both omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids . flaxseed is nature 's richest storehouse of omega-3 fatty acids , and contains more than twice as much omega-3 oil as fish oils , and it costs less , ounce for ounce . flax also contains other important substances like lignans , which may protect against some types of cancer . the husks of the seeds are rich in mucilage . both the seed oil and mucilage have many nutritional and therapeutic properties . there are many potential benefits from taking flax seed oil : flaxseed oil lowers cholesterol levels , thereby improving cardiovascular health and lessening the risk of arteriosclerosis . flaxseed also contains plant nutrients like phytoestrogens . these are natural estrogen-like substances that can lessen the discomfort of menopause . flaxseed oil may lower high blood pressure . flaxseed oil helps some people improve their psoriasis and eczema , as it has anti-inflammatory properties . flaxseed may also reduce the itching , swelling , and redness associated with certain skin disorders such as acne . flaxseed oil has a positive effect on rheumatoid arthritis due to its ability to calm inflammation . flaxseed reduces ldl ( low-density lipoprotein ) cholesterol ( the body 's `` bad cholesterol '' ) and lowers triglyceride levels . research shows that flaxseed oil gives much better protection against heart attacks than canola oil or olive oil . taking flaxseed may reduce cancer risk . this is because flaxseed contains the richest sources of lignan building blocks , which play a major role in preventing cardiovascular diseases and cancer . new research indicates that the lignans in flaxseed have both short-term and long-term protective effects against colon cancer . nature made flaxseed oil is a quality source of flaxseed oil , as the company is well-known and reputable . one tip : keep your flaxseed oil away from light and heat , as both degrade the oil . the usual beneficial dose of flaxseed oil is 2-3 capsules once per day taken with a meal . the benefits of flaxseed oil are cumulative . commit to taking it every day without fail . like any herbal supplement , do n't expect dramatic quick results . the results you get will be subtle at first and then build over time . for specific conditions such as rhematoid arthritis , exzema , psoriasis , acne , etc , . the results should be apparent in 4-8 weeks . be patient ! know that even if you do n't `` feel '' different , you are sill protecting your body from the harmfull effects of many disease conditions . jim `` konedog '' koeni
health	i had ordered this item expecting good things from it . however , the article has never worked properly . the electrical system seems to be working fine , but the uv light has never come on . somehow it seems pointless to have a toothbrush sanitizer that does not sanitize . right now the product is only a toothbrush holder ; nothing more . i generally do not pay such a high price for a toothbrush holder . i have been in contact with the producer of the product and hope to have something done about it . in short , i wo n't buy anything like this again
health	advil liquigels are excellent for headaches . i am writing this review to warn customers that this product from amazon does not ship in 1 or 2 weeks ( as advertised ) . i ordered this product more than 2 months ago and am still waiting for it to be shipped . it is probably a good idea to spend the extra few bucks and buy this from the grocery store ( like i had to eventually do when i ran out )
health	i purchased this dryer to replace an older one that is far too loud . while this new one is much quieter than the old one , it really is n't super-quiet . still , i have no complaints on the noise , but the flimsy wall mounting hardware is another story . the threaded holes in the mounting plate are extremely fragile , so much so that they both were wrung out during the initial mounting of the dryer . it did n't help any that the mounting holes were extremely hard to locate once the plate was mounted - it 's hard to see thru that white plastic shell . i ended up having to discard the original threaded screws and use two slightly larger metal tapping screws to mount the dryer to the bracket . this worked fine , but the original mounting hardware is n't very well designed in my opinion . other than that the dryer seems to work very well , although i have n't had it long enough to know how well it will last . all in all , i 'd give the dryer 4 stars out of 5
health	i 've been relying on this lotions for over a decade . of the many i 've tried , it 's the only one that provides both immediate dryness relief and long-lasting moisturizing . some may find the initial glycerin slickness to be excessive , especially on hands , but if you have skin as dry as mine you 'll tolerate a minute or two of `` greasiness '' for the softness and comfort that lasts for hours . these comments are for neutrogena emulsion only -- neutrogena body lotion did not work well for me
health	first of all , let 's talk about the noise level on this thing . yikes ! that should be against some kind of consumer protection law . the blowdryer part is ok , but did n't like the brushes at all . i 'll go back to my conair stying brush and my straightener . live and learn
health	the foot bath makes a mess with the water and does not keep the water warm . a lot more hassel than it is worth . sorry i spent my money on it
health	i was anxious to use this for my mother as she has a bad back . however , immediately after opening the product , i tried to plug it in , as it does n't work without batteries being fully charged . unfortunately , this massager would plug in but did not start charging , and therefore , it could not be charged . i will be returning this item
health	the foil is abrasive and can cause razor bumps . also the shave is not close and will missed areas around my rear jaw line that my remington gets fairly easily . overrated and overpriced eurotrash .
health	this is a great barber-style setup ... it comes with a lot of guides and has a little case . they even give you a garbage bag . good dea
health	adds a great fragrance to the room . we bought several different scents and placed them throughout the house . it 's a different smell in every room . what a pleasant change from smelling the pets .
health	the bars look like mudpies , are very dry , and all three `` flavors '' taste the same , meaning that they do n't have much flavor at all . i much prefer certain flavors of balance bars . the only good thing about these clif bars is that i do n't get hungry for several hours after eating one
health	chair is not at all what it 's advertised as . does not massage just vibrates and makes you feel sick . compatible with sitting on a washing machine .
health	one-battery trimmers simply not strong enough , was glad to find a two-batteries version . it has a perfect design which will attract many more naive surfers like me . unfortunately it 's not good for nose hair trimming . problem is it makes electric-like unpleasant sensations when touches sensitive skin inside nose . so much that it makes you scared using it ; - ) it also does n't cut well , does n't reach inside , makes burning smell and overheated . update on 2/7/2007 : from my recent experience , the microtouch turbo is an excellent alternative which has no problems mentioned above . the only problem is its durability ( you may find yourself buying 2 per year ) but at the price below $ 10 this is not a real issue . good luck
health	i bought it new . after using this shaver a couple of times in a shower , it stopped working . i took it to a braun affiliated repair shop . braun wrote that the shaver has water damage to the interior , including the electronics . they said this is not a manufacturing defect and left the costs of repair to me . i checked the manual before i used the shaver in the shower - it does not say that you can not use it in a shower . i have not opened the shaver , i have not cleaned it in water . thus , based on my experience , this shaver and braun are a scam as far as i am concerned
health	i saw a commercial , i read a reviews - and so i bough one box at walmart . it 's not worth it , that 's my conclusion . the trays are made of very thin plastic-like material , and are very difficult to position properly on your teeth . the active gel easy goes out of trays , and fills your mouth . during first couple od uses , after 20 min or so i started to feel a vague pain in my gum . nevertheless , i continued using the product for all 7 days , as advertised , 30 min a day . after the whole package was gone , the change of color of my teeth is barely visible . i hope you will have better luck .
health	maybe it 's my own fault , but i did n't get that from the product description . it 's a weensy little thing for using on your desk at work or taking with you on business trips ; in my apartment it barely lasts through one night . it 's also really noisy . i am probably comparing to my last ( normal sized ) humidifier ( a vicks something or other , no longer available ) which was great and lasted 3 years , until hard water built up too much limescale ... i would have cleaned more if i 'd have realized how hard it is to find one to replace it
health	bell harrah is so right ! this things is indeed garbage ! i have been using this things since march 9 , 2005 and there is very little difference in my hair . it still breaks , for goodness sakes , and where is the hard nails that is also suppose to result from using these pills ? ! it makes me wonder what the hell this thing is doing to my body , as it has not helped my hair and this month of may makes it 4 months i have been using . you 're suppose to see some huge changes within a month to 45 days , and not one damn thing has happened ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! and the pills are so damn expensive ! . i really do n't have $ 57 to throw a way a month , so when you spend that amount of money you are really hoping that something will work . i agree with the previous reviewer-do n't waste your money
health	i had never eaten a luna bar before i made this purchase , so i had expectations that were not even close to being fufilled . when i read `` chocolate pecan pie '' .. i expected just that.. the taste of rich chocolate , with nutty pecans and a gooey sugary base . what i received was a bar with little taste , nothing at all similar to the name on the bar . in my opinion , the bar is edible if you have no expectations of it ... the flavor is barely there . the bar is dry . it is never again be on my `` purchase '' list
health	i 've owned two thermaphore heating pads , different sizes , for many years and i 'm using one right now ! they 're quality made to last a lifetime . they trap moisture from the air so no need for soaking sponges to insert . the trigger switch allows you to heat as needed as hot as you like and if you fall asleep there are no worries of burns..if the trigger is n't depressed it is n't heating . i would n't be without mine . it helps me manage my arthritis/fibromylagia/nerve damage pain . i 've recommended it to many of my friends who have been very pleased as well .
health	this pad works , basically , but it does turn itself after 30 minutes . there 's no way to prevent that . this may be fine for some uses , but it 's very inconvenient for others
health	this one 's going back to the store . it has been turned on for almost half an hour and i barely feel the heat . if you ask me , my feet in some thick socks would produce the same amount of heat . as for the `` massage '' , it 's worthless to me , but i am not one for vibrating massage anyway , i prefer shiatsu . i get cold feet when i am home and not moving around a lot , so i think i will stick to wrapping my electric throw blanket around my cold feet
health	i made the mistake of buying this light to treat my acne without first talking to my dermatologist about it . after just using it three times my acne became more out of control than it had in years -- my face broke out in places it had never broken out before . it took me two months of using medication from my doctor to get my acne under control . i would not recommend using this device unless a doctor says it would work for you
health	daughter was very pleased when she received it unexpectedly , after her good news ! she 's very picky also ... just loved the quality and organizational value of the set ! very nicely packaged . would highly recommend
health	these did not suppress my appetite , though many days i took 3 tablets three times a day ! had very good luck with a bottle of dytrexil ( also a hoodia product ) , but the next bottle of that , nothing . i guess like crops , you can get good batches and bad batches . these struck me as a bad batch . as one reviewer said , i actually felt hungrier many days . egad ! better luck next time ! sigh
health	great price , free shipping ... .basically ... i love it ! ! i placed my order on sunday and got it 8:00 a.m. tuesday morning ... i highly recommend this seller ... i will definitely continue to buy from this seller myself..
health	i have been using source of life energy shake for many years . i recommend one scoop in 8 oz . of orange juice or milk twice a day . basically , i pour the milk in a shaker cup and put the scoop on top , close the shaker and shake for a few seconds . this stuff tastes great and has loads of healthy vitamins , herbs , minerals , and more ! a few months ago , i actually used this drink to cut down on my starbuck 's daily double shot of expresso ! guess a source of life starbucks latte would be great , maybe i 'll try that someday ! this product deserves more than 5 stars and it is absolutely a great product in every way . if you are looking for a healthy energy drink that tastes good , you have found it
health	the adjustable slider combs are horrible and i found the conair where you had several combs to choose from worked better for me . i can not get it to cut the hair on my husband who likes it very short , it would not even take any hair off . all it did was waste money and electricity to charge the battery . i thought this was the best brand out there , but conair beats them by a mile . i think i will take it back and get a refund and go buy a conair with the money .
health	i looked a many other back support pads . some were too big , and others were just complicated . the obus forme side to side is perfect . it is very light weight and small , therefore , very portable . i use it in the car and take it with me to the office . the strap on the back fits well around any chair back , although , i have found i do n't need to use it because it stays put
health	it should be noted in the description of this item that this product also doubles as a vibrator ! i 'm not talking about the muscle relaxing kind ; i 'm talking about the sexually stimulating kind . once you remove the plastic prongs that are designed to relax the head/neck , the base is an approximately 5 inch vibrator . just be forewarned , customers , this item is not for the easily offended
health	easy to use . short time to recharge the baterie . long life batery and it is appropriate o sensitive skin
health	i was excited to try these because i liked the idea of getting my son something that let him put his legs together . i am tired of seeing him so bowlegged due to the diapers . and since i like the other huggies styles , i was very enthused . until i went through 5 diapers , everyone of which leaked . leaking of urine was the biggest problem but after a bm came out the legs , i gave up . i tried everything possible to make these work , but they leak . maybe in the smaller sizes , but size 5 on a 22 month old definitely did not work . also , my son is in 50 % percentile for height and weight , so skinny legs were not the problem . no more natural fit/hugflex for us
health	i'am very satisfied with the vidal sassoon hairdryer . there are 3 heat settings and tips in the enclosed booklet on how to use these settings . it is a little bulky but it does n't take long to get used to a larger dryer . i would recommend this hair dyer
health	i 've got this meter a month ago . i intended to use it to measure my pulse during exercise , but i 've never been able to do so ! at rest , the meter gives a reading after several attempts , but often inaccurate . you have to stay still as a statue for 10-20 seconds to get a reading . now i 'm using it as an exercise watch/stopwatch
health	used it once and put it in the dogs ' tub . it 's really awkward to use . it sucks up your water pressure , too . ca n't figure it out . i have incredible water pressure , but with this thing on , it went down to nothing . stick to the original shower massage by waterpik
health	old spice classic is far and away the best deodorant i 've ever used . it goes on clean , unlike those `` powdery '' white deodorants . it also has a great fragrance and longevity after application . i think a lot of that is due to the high alcohol content ; if you look at the ingredients , you 'll see that alcohol is listed first . in fact , the container sports a `` flammable '' warning . the alcohol really does work well to contain odor . alcohol-based deodorants are pretty hard to find , so i 'm thankful this product is still being made
health	maybe my toenails are just too thick , but this cutter just is not heavy duty enough to cut them ... i threw them away upon first use . my old toenail cutters were the same design but i do n't know who made them ... they worked fine ... heavier duty metal and much sharper . these are junk imho
health	i would have given it zero stars but that is not an option . it stopped working after about 10 minutes of static filled reception . it was difficult to get a station . and it was not a problem with the batteries . run , do n't walk , *away* from this
health	i am very happy with the emjoi compact epilator that i purchased . it does exactly what it claims to do and works wonderfully . until i asked a salon for advice on the best way to remove unwanted facial hair , i did n't even know something like this exhisted . i just wish i would have known about this product years ago . a. davis
health	if you are trying to learn relaxation through biofeedback , this is the product to buy . packaging , support , presentation , and hardware/software quality are the best that i have seen . no down side . it 's not a game in the usual sense . more of a way to learn techniques in a quiet and amusing way . there is room for a little mischief . instead of allowing the balloons to flow smoothly , i tried busting a few . type a personality shows through occasionally . i will be purchasing the next item in the series . i am learning to relax , at will , which will be helpful in my high-stress occupation . good luck
health	i had heard that chocoleans were effective , but i was very disappointed . they taste good , but did n't satisfy my hunger or my sweet tooth . about the same as eating a piece of dark chocolate . i wound up gaining weight while using these
health	i was pretty excited to try an ion hairdryer . i got this one because i liked the idea of being able to 'control ' the amount of ions coming out . my hair did seem a little shinier after using it ( the only reason i gave it two stars and not one ) but my hair felt a little drier . almost straw-ish ... it never felt like that with my old drier . also the buttons really are hard to switch ... all of them ! i read another review that said that and i thought well how bad can it be ? i dry my hair with a round brush in my right hand and the dryer in the left . i turn the dryer on and off during different times while i am doing my hair . with this dryer i could not turn the on/off switch with my left hand . i had to put down my brush and use both hands . i could not believe how hard it was to switch ! this was the main deciding factor in returning the dryer , it was so frustrating not to be able to switch it easily with a flick of your thumb . not to mention made me feel like a big wussy ! ! ! the speed setting only has two settings , low and high . the low setting was way too low and the high setting was way too high . a middle ground would have been nice . lastly , the dryer smelled a little weird . granted , i only had it two days before i returned it , so the smell might eventually disappear . but it was n't your normal 'new hairdryer , hot plastic ' smell . it was almost a slight mildew smell . yuk . so , i would not recommend getting it . i exchanged it for the vidal sassoon ion sensor dryer . that seems to be working better . the low speed setting is perfect . the smell is normal 'new dryer ' smell so far . the buttons are easy to push ! ! ! ! the sensor ( it automatically turns off when you pur it down ) is a little off , it takes a while to turn off . but all in all i like it . and it also does make my hair shiny and does not make it feel drier or like straw !
health	after using the dryer ( which i liked very much and did a quick job ) , i discovered that my hair was being ruined . it would break off in small 2 inch curved pieces . i stopped using it for a month and confirmed that was the problem because the lavatory was no longer filled with broken pieces of hair . i would like to return it and get my money back ! ! !
health	pros : it 's really cheap , and has a lot of features ( set stride length , calories , clock , backlight , protective door ) con : the door is really , incredibly , intolerably hard to open . i was adding a dozen steps to the readout just trying to get the door open . i tried to trim the plastic tab , but i took too much off , now the door flops open . it was useless the way it came from the factory , now i broke it and ca n't use it at all without a rubber band to keep it closed . also , i was never able to get a very accurate step-count . i would count 100 steps and usually get 65-90 steps on the readout , though i 'm not really sure because i had to shake the thing for a minute or two just to get the door open . for the price , i think this would be a great deal for someone with the patience to work with it
health	these item i purchase on 2/21/07 i used only for 3 week and it broke i do not kwon if i can return or not to have my money back or replace with anothe
health	the brush completely feel apart prior to using it . i sent a review to the company with no response . the wooden back fell off of the handle and then the loofah fell off of the backing . if i would have had some response from the company offering some recourse i would not have been this dissatisfied
health	i expected so much and yet recieved so little from these so called batteries . number one , i was disappointed to find out , after some scientific analyses i performed on them , that duracell 's world famous copper top statement is erroneous . this so called copper top is nothing more than a copper-aluminum alloy called copposyclamatrane . i ca n't top the copper top ? hardly . after the analyses , i put these copper top batteries to the test . what i did was i stuck them in my flashlight expecting a brilliant flashlike-like sheen . what i got was far from . a tiny light that could only be classified as much less than miniscule . i threw the flashlight at my cat in disgust , expecting hilarious results , and i was n't disapointed ! this was the only good thing that came out of the worst purchase decision i 've ever made . thanks for nothing , dura-hell
health	i used this cream for three weeks , two times a day and it did make some part of my circles lighter- from brown it went to pink . but i skipped one day and it all went back . you pretty much have to be tied to it and keep using it two times a day
health	yes , that 's right . this worked for me for only one day . what a disappointment
health	after reading the review regarding palm kernel oil in all of the luna bar flavors , i decided to read all the ingredients for each flavor myself . i noticed that the luna bar toasted nuts 'n ' cranberry flavor is the only flavor that does not contain palm kernel oil . if you are concerned about palm kernel oil you should purchase this flavor . the toasted nuts 'n ' cranberry flavor is delicious , does n't taste like a candy bar , and has low total and saturated fat gram percentages . luna bar toasted nuts 'n ' cranberry flavor is one of the better nutrition bars available on the market .
health	this would be a great item except it is n't clear that it only works on handles that are pointing to the right . our doors have the handles going to the left leaving this item useless for us
health	some products lead to real improvement of your skin ( retin a , exfoliators ) while others simply cover up the imperfections acting like a make up . the sad and hillarious thing is that most consumers mix up makeup effects with real skin improvement . the regenerist contains silicones that fill in small wrinkles and mattify the skin surface thus acting like an invisible makeup . such effects lead most consumers to believe their crow 's feet are smaller . if you really want to do a test , you should stop using the product for a few days using only face wash . if during that time you observe smaller wrinkles then the product works . you ca n't really claim the wrinkles are smaller while the product is on your face covering them hello ... . and another thing , a wrinkle ca n't be erased in one or 3 weeks - the skin does n't produce collagen that fast ( unless you cut it ) . paying $ 18 / 1.7 oz ( retail price , its cheaper on amazon but you have to pay shipping price ) for a silicone makeup is a little steep for me provided that there are cheaper products on the market that will make your skin look equally good cause they contain the same silicone base even better - try monistat soothing care - chafing relief powder gel 1.5 oz , $ 7 at cvs . i have been using matrixyl ( the active peptide in regenerist ) for 6 months in my own formulations ( without silicones ) and frankly speaking have n't noticed any improvement in my crows feet or the lines on my forehead . currently there is only one study of the effects of matrixyl conducted by sederma - the manifacturer of matrixyl which makes me quite suspicious about the whole story ...
health	over the years , i have tried many different brands and types of heated rollers and i never liked using any of them . i recently bought a new set which i had to return due to the fact that i had a terrible time trying to roll my hair on the almost smooth surface of the rollers and then after clipping the rolls , they would immediately fall out of my hair ... .scream ! i bought the remmington # 1080n wax core roller set and i have finally found the easiest and quickest way to curl my hair . the rollers surface , when warm , grab the hair ends immediately to allow great control when trying to roll even short hair . the rollers are held in place by a full clip which looks more like a comb so the clips do not leave a ridge in my hair . once heated , the rollers are relatively cool to the touch ( no more burned fingers ) but due to the wax core , the rollers hold plenty of heat and it takes just a few minutes after setting to produce excellent , long lasting results . the set takes about 10 - 15 minutes to warm up . i 've found the warm up time takes longer than the time i actually leave the curlers in my hair . this is the best curler set i have ever used . if i was to ask for one change , it would be a quicker warm up time . however , just the fact that rolling is so quick and easy , makes up for the few extra minutes of preparation . i 'm hard to please , so my recommendation says alot . thanks remmington ( i still do n't like your other regular rollers ! ha )
health	the product smells really good , is very affordable and helps maintain my hair style all day . i highly recommend trying it . i will make it part of my daily hairdress ( grooming ) for life !
health	this is the best shaver i 've ever used . it shaves closer and quicker than the many norelcos i 've used , all of which costed a lot more than the r-960 . the only improvement i 'd like to see is in the battery , which does not really maintain its strength well between charges
health	does n't show you what station you are listening to . it starts over at 88.9 every time you shut it off . by the time you scan a few stations , it stops getting a signal and you have to start off at 88.9 , again .
health	this mabis steam inhaler really puts out the steam ! i am very satisfied and would heartily reccommend this item to anyone looking for a steam inhaler
health	i got this as a gift for christmas , and i 've tried it twice so far . both times i get the same result - it does n't work . i understand that with wet hair , it wo n't dry it , obviously . but even with damp hair , as instructed , it does n't get my hair dry . as for the actual straightening aspect , i still end up with frizzy hair that is n't even all that straight . it 's not worth the money - spend the extra bucks and get a chi or infrashine , you 'll be a lot better off
health	this can not be the real thing . the scent does n't last 5 minutes . what a waste of $ 50.00 . i am so disappointed .
health	this shaver only works on short or fine hair . if your hair is long ( more than 1/4 inch ) or coarse , it just skips over the hair and does n't do anything . i 've thrown it away and gone back to disposable razors
health	as expected , the new 7180xl razor delivers a close and comfortable electric shave , even though it runs much slower than earlier models . the slow speed does make it very quiet and the new cleaning method is very handy . just 2 noticable disappointments : 1 . the external power supply is a rather combersome change from former norelco products . 2 . the exclusion of a storage case is certainly an unwelcome `` feature '' of an otherwise good product at a premium price
health	the glasses are well made but i found them awkward to use . they did n't fit comfortably and it took quite a bit of time to get them on . the gimmick sounded cool but did n't work well for me . every head is different , so maybe they 'll work better for you
health	for the price you cant beat this product , if the problem i 'm experiencing can be solved . i bought two of these brushes , one for my home bathroom and one for my work-out bag . love the price and timer feature ... but it seems that once i 've used up the power in the brush , it wont recharge properly . i 'm experiencing this problem with both brushes no matter how long i leave it in the charger . if there is a simple fix for this then i 'd say 5 stars . if not , then 2 stars is well earned , seeing as how i 've been on their support line waiting ( as i type this ) for over an hour
health	tried this product for 2 weeks ; it did improve the clarity and softness , but i found the product to be too scratchy and it did not rinse off well , seemed to have a sticky feel . since then , i found a wonderful microdermabrasion product called microdermx by nikkel holistic skincare . this product performs like magic ; it is not too scratchy and i can do a whole microderm treatment and not end up feeling like i 've been slapped with a wire brush . i can do the treatment 2-3x 's a week , ( like your supposed to ) but i also use it each morning as a cleanser and everyday is better than the day before . it is a magical product . bette hampton , chicago , i
health	i got this humidifer for my daughter 's bedroom . she loved the big apple but it only ran for about one hour at a time , then automatically shut off . tried all the troubleshooting suggestions to no avail . i had to return it . however , i did buy the penguin shape for my 2nd daughter 's room and that one works great .
health	just received this massager and my wife and i ca n't stop massaging each other with it . especially great deal for the special amazon price . i 've been wanting one of these for years because i can hardly feel those little hand held ones ( that just fit in the palm of your hand ) . glad i splurged . only problem is that amazon site says `` 7 heads '' , item description says `` 6 heads '' , and actul product only included 5 heads . the one missing , from the picture on the box , is the `` acu point '' heads . i 'm guessing that 's why it 's on sale ? still worth it if you get it on sale . great massager .
health	my wife and i have used this a few times now and really like it . from a novice 's point of view , this is a great meditation aid . i like being able to get the visual feedback as i calm and center myself . i guess the hardest part is not letting myself get too anxious as i try to accomplish the task in front of me . it 's also a very pretty game with very lush and detailed visuals as well as a nice soundtrack
health	i finally got this toothbrush after i have seen alot of people use them . i am very disappointed . the design of the brush and the charger seems really outdated and bulky . it 's constantly getting dirty with dust and tooth paste . it 's very hard to clean . it 's loud , and small brush . not to mention the replacements for the brush are too expensive . no thank you
health	i am in my early 30 's and never had a problem with acne until my mid 20 's . i had been using proactiv for quite some time ( 5 years or so ) and it worked pretty well . i say pretty well since it did clear my face some , but my face has not been totally clear in a long time . along comes acnefree which is `` better '' than proactiv since you can buy it locally and it contains more of the active ingredient -- cool , i am sick of ordering it online and it is cheaper ! well , i guess you get what you pay for -- i do n't consider myself to have particularly sensitive skin , but i used acnefree one time in the morning . so far so good -- until 2 am the next morning when i broke out in hives all over my entire body . so no more acnefree for me , just wanted to give my experience for anyone who might be in the same situation
health	this is a great tool . this help people to get back on track `` physically '' . it is hard to find effective training tools . this one is great for those who need back door training . simple to use and rock hard ! up yours
health	this thing did not survive the unpacking , inserted the battery put the housing back and bent a plastic doohicky in the inside . not worth it
health	product is exactly what you would expect . i have been using it for 2 months 3-5 times a day with great success . i would buy it again knowing how well it works
health	i have not recieved the vitamins ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! lost in the mail ? ? ? ? ? ? please let me know what i can do , it has been a month
health	my biggest issue with this shaker is that it does n't seal properly around the threaded part of the cap . even if i really tighten it up , i still get a small leak when i shake it . also , the cap for the mouthpiece pops off pretty easy . but overall it gets the job done , and having fluid graduations on the side are nice
health	i used relacore for one week ... ..it did n't work the only thing it helped with was sleeping . the bottle says take one with each meal and i did by 3pm daily i was fighting to keep my eyes open . if you need help sleeping this is one too take . also i put on 3 pounds
health	i agree with the reviews from the other reviewers . it basically ruined my nails the first time i used it . however what i did discover is that this is an excellent products for keeping my dogs claws trimmed . after trimming their claws you often get rough edges . i now use this manicure kit to smooth the edges and keep their claws short . they do n't seem to mind it becuase it is very quiet . i must state that i will never again use this product for my own nails
health	i just bought this small fountain for my office at work thinking that the soothing sound of water would be a nice addition . however , after setting it up , i added the water and the waited and waited and waited to hear the cascading sound of water . no cascading sound . i added more water -- nothing ... i added less water -- absolutely nothing . the design is built such that the water moves down without making any noise . it is useless from that perspective ... plus , you can tell it is made of plastic so it is n't really that nice to look at either . i would definitely not buy this again and am contemplating getting rid of it after 1 week of use
health	i bought two clarisonic brushes - one as a gift and one for myself . although the product works well , unfortunately , both brushes were defective . the trouble started occurring about two months after using . one brush started out with two speed settings , but eventually only functioned at the low setting . the other brush started turning on by itself and eventually could not be recharged ! my experience with the customer service has been terrible . they would not replace my brush for me even though the product was still under warranty . be careful if you are going to travel abroad . the warranty on the brush is nulled if you use the brush in a power outlet other than 110v !
health	i am a reviewer and i was checking out this 'sleep aid ' when it struck me as strange that almost every review for this product sounds like a promotion of the product , not a review , and note that the reviewers have only one review ( click on their 'see all my reviews ' ) . beware of this shoddy marketing ploy . this 'crud ' alone merits my one star rating . amazon needs to censor these reviews
health	the straightener works ok . it straightens my hair better when it is dry . i have very course hair . i still had to blow dry it to get it to straighten out , and go over it a few times to really make it straight . the remington is to thick , so you can not style the hair at all with it . the worst part about this particular straightener is when i leave it plugged in and have it shut off it keeps making a beeping sound ? ? i have to unplug it to make it stop . i just bought a chai straightner for about three times the cost of this , it is only 1 inch thick so it styles the hair very nice , but it straightens my hair the same as the remington . i have only had it a few weeks , so i am intrested to see if the chai causes less damage as it claims then other straighteners
health	i 've been using this for the last 3 months and i 'm a very satisfied customer . i get a very close shave , and no razor bumpors . i 'm afircan american and my beard is coarse and curly , sometimes with many razor this can lead to ingrown hair problems . i highly recommend this , because it 's a much close shave than the typical elctric razors by brands such as braun and norelic . it 's very cheap and the only maintainence is clipper oil . i cam across these because the only time i would get a great shave was at the barber . when he used clippers on me i 've never had any problems with ingrown hair , therefore i decided to own my own pair of clippers . i 'm very pleased with with product and highly recommended as a very effective and affordable method for shaving and trimming
health	i went through 3 of these in less than 2 months . after about 2-3 weeks of use , the first two dryers would n't shut off when the switch was placed in the `` off '' position ; the dryers had to be unplugged to turn them off . the 3rd dryer just stopped working completely after about 2 weeks . i definitely do not recommend buying this product
health	this is my first electric shaver and i am very pleased with the results . use the trimmer to reduce the length of the hair and then use the cleancut to `` make it smooth '' . no knicks no cuts ! ! ! i am pleased !
health	i recommend that you not buy this product through the mail . my three boxes leaked all over the amazon box . yuck
health	i bought this for a far-sighted relative , but it did n't magnify enough , and was distractinly blurry , so the gift was n't well received . i give this two thumbs down
health	like many other negative reviews , i 've experienced the same problems with this razor . i guess less blades is more and i 'm going back to the m3 power . i 'll be brief about the problems : 1. there 's more `` pulling '' when you shave . it felt like the hair on my face was being pulled out than cut . 2. the razor is harder to clean off . 3. i would get slight razor burn and i never get razor burn . 4. it 's more expensive than other better razors out there . so there you have it . if you have to try it out , hey it might work for you . but please , keep your receipt ( and packaging ) in case you want to get a refund . * * if you 're reading this is 2009 , chances are that gillette 's money back guarantee will no longer be around . however , there will probably be a gillette razor with 12 blades by then
health	i bought this product and the accuracy depends on having good test strips . i simultaneously had bloodwork at the doctor 's office when i did the test . except for the total cholesterol , all the other tests were off . the manual states to check for the blue color at the back of the test strips after the test is done . except for total cholestrol the other test strips did not have a blue color . the test strips which are expensive were bad . i am planning on returning this produc
health	it 's ok that helps to moisturize the skin , but it 's just stays oily and can not be absorbed appropriately in the skin .
health	i am diabetic and i have been losing about 10 lbs per month for 6 months eating these bars as a between meal source of protein . they satisfy my taste for something sweet and are filling .
health	i got this product after seeing the ads on tv for possibly the hundredth time . i need to clean dirty fingerprints off my cabinets . i opened the package . followed directins exactly and got nothng for my troubles . i used the first sponge in the package . it got less than half a cabinet door clean before it started breaking apart in my hand . i was willing to accept that the first one was possibly defective but not the second one . it cleaned an area smaller than the size of a quarter before it started coming apart in my hand . i was n't even pressing very hard . i 'll stick to my sponges with the scrubbing pads for cleaning my cabinets and other things around my house . i 'm a little ticked that this did n't last for one good cleaning let alone one good minute .
health	would work great , except ... this does n't fit my new waterpik ultra ( wp-100 ) .
health	this shaver is ok but has an electronic problem . i get clean shave with little bit of effort but , my main problem is with on/off button . just after using this for 3-4 months my shaver on/off button stopped working . it is always in on position i ca n't switch off the razor . the only way it switches off is when the battery runs out
health	i never thought the world would get here . i am actually spending time to type up a review , online , for shaving lotion . well , here you go : for every man out there who is interested and who has ever used an electric shaver , if you have n't tried the norelco cool skin electric shaver with this lotion , you have to . whoever has sensitive skin , you need to switch to this , because it does a great job . that 's all i have to say and i wo n't waste anymore time
health	i 'd give it 0 starts if that was an option ! a total piece of crap ! try cleaning it , and the head falls apart ! try putting it back together , and plan on doing nothing else for a long time ! do not buy this razor
health	i bought this hairdryer and it worked really well for one week , but then it just died on me . one week
health	very handy that you can put it in your handbag wherever you go . you can use it to read those tiny words in the label when you are grocery shopping . better than magnifier glass because the width of this bookmark covers the whole line of a page
health	this item worked well for a month or so , but then began working intermitently after that . eventually it stopped working all together . in my opinion it is a pretty cheaply made item . i would not recommend it
health	works great , no problems after 4 months
health	it does n't do what it 's supposed to do . this gizmo is supposed to clean out the pores and generally clean up the skin on your face . did n't work for me
health	i hate this product . i receive it as a gift , and all the products are not adapted for babies , plus , looks very cheap !
health	i will never purchase another neutrogena product , again . there products are dangerous ! ! ! it burned my face . my face is all red , swollen , red , irritated , and itchy . my new best friend is cortizone 10 , the anti itch cream . it 's been a week since i stopped using netrogena , and i still look horrifying ! ! ! ! perfect for halloween , right ? but , halloween is over , and i still look scary . this product has aged me ! ! ! it has caused a ton of wrinkles from where the skin is puffy and swollen . never , again , neutrogena ! ! !
health	these wipes were much thinner than i expected/remembered . i had to use at least 3 at a time . i wo n't buy these again
health	received the monitor quickly . it works well . the automatic feature is great .
health	the off-on switch on this product is very difficlut to use . i am not able to turn off or on with one hand and find it very difficult to turn on with two hands .
health	clif bars have been part of my families life for a long time and provides a good quick meal or snack depending on your activity level . definitely recommend having water available
health	too difficult to program , have had 2 weeks and still have not been able to complete process , instructions stay on screen too short a time , all i am able to get is weight , can not see other information on screen unless on floor and right on top of it , would send back but too much of a hassel and expense , too expensive for a scale that is only to give me my current weigh
health	this product does not work if you have soft blonde hair . my hair is not coarse and this razor just glided right over top with out cutting a thing . it 's comfortable to hold and seems like it is made well , but it is definatly not for those of us with soft hair .
health	just as it advertised , it is soft and dries up hair and body quickly . i bought it because it was on sale and thought why not try it out , well , i am sold on this product . only drawback now is the high price tag..
health	like the product very much . comfortable and convenient . i would recommend then if : you have a small hat size , do n't mind carrying around an odd shaped soft carrying bag . with the above i do n't have a problem . the most distracting problem is your eyes sweat inside the foam enclosed , goggle like eye pieces on warm days . i 've thought about cutting vents in the foam around the eye , but have not done this as of jan,2007 . i like them very innovative
health	top of the line ( april 2005 ) d-cell nimh batteries have 11,000 mah compared to this one 2,200 mah ( they cost 16 bucks but 10,000 mah battery costs six bucks ) . top of the line aa nimh batteries have capacity of 2500 mah . top of the line nicad d-cell batteries have 5000 mah capacity ( costs around five bucks ) . i thought that nimh was more capable than nicad . true , but not in this case . so what are we gettting here ? higher aa battery capacity in d-cell case . this battery is overpriced for what it delivers .
health	i got the fusion razor in the mail a few weeks ago so i decided to give it a try . at first it seemed ok , but i started noticing that it pulled at the hair on my face more than my mach 3 turbo . i decided to experiment and shave half of my face with a mach 3 turbo and the other half with the fusion . from my experience , the mach 3 turbo gave a closer shave , and glided much smoother across my skin than the fusion . i think the 5 blades on the fusion are more of a gimmick than anything else . and as cool as the single trimming blade is , it seems like gillette had to include this because of the poor accuracy of having 5 blades . in other words , the single blade is a fix rather than a feature . my call is if your using a mach 3 turbo , do n't waste your money on the fusion
health	this is a truly amazing deal from amazon , where i also received free priority mail shipping . the photo does not display all that you will get . you will receive 6 boxes of q-tips cotton swabs , totaling an ammazing 3,500 q-tips in all . i will never ever have to purchase another q-tip as long as i live ! ! ! ! ! what a fantastic deal from amazon !
health	the lotion does not get very warm and only the lotion in the uppermost part of the dispenser gets warm . so if you want to use a lot of lotion , you have to wait in between while the lotion warms up . i have dry skin so i put lotion all over . its more of an inconvenience to have to wait for each application to warm up and even when it does warm up , it is n't super warm .
health	i 've been using regenerist daily for 6 months . i added the peel system this past month . what a change ! i 'm 60 . my skin has clarity i have n't seen in years . pores close up , small lines and wrinkles really do seem to disappear . i 'll stick with this from now on
health	after reading several comments i tried to proof my scale is working properly . however , like someone else wrote the scale is not consistant . i weight myself several times and noticed very considerable diferrences in readings . like some one else i even tried placing an additional amount of weight in my hands . the scale gave me several readings for the same amount of weight . now ! a digital scale is supposed to be percise..
health	pedometer part is fine . radio part is useless
health	this is the best shaver i have ever owned and i wish it was still available
health	yo nunca habia usado una afeitadora electrica y al comprar esta hice una excelente inversion porque me deja la piel practicamente lisa , muy suave y lo mejor de todo no tengo que usar agua . le dura la bateria y se limpia muy facilmente con el cepillito que trae . si compras el polvo de remington que ellos recomiendan es mucho mejor porque la afeitadora se desliza con mas suavidad . saludos rafael desde cabimas venezuel
health	it is a great product and makes my husband 's face as smooth as a baby 's you know ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .
health	this product is not good at all i had to return mine after only 2 weeks . i found out that it is really inaccurate and it does n't work when you want it to . as for as the body fat percentage i could n't even get it to work . do not buy this product
health	i had bought this razor after reading some of the reviews . i used the razor as directed in the instruction manual . the manual said when you first use the razor your beard would get used to it after a few weeks of use . i used the razor for a few weeks and with ever week the bumps got worse . i had to stop using it entirely for my skin to heal . do not buy this product
health	i started taking anxietol 7 to help me with my stress at work . i am not usually a stressed out sort of person however i recently got transfered to nyc and i 'm from utah , just that move itself is enough to stress anyone out . i am working as a trader and it is very high energy . anxietol 7 is helping me cope with my new life here
health	design seems flawed a bit for the container . when you pull the cord out , it bumps the tank off sometimes . the tank also seems a little loose when mounted . i tried the newest ultra dental water pik type , but it only lasted 1 month then began to leak water
health	now that i 'm writing this review , it seems silly that i 'm so happy over such a small thing as a toothbrush . but i am . i bought this item not long after i had my first ( and hopefully only ) root canal and crown four years ago , something which i never again want to experience in my life ( as someone else described , it was painful and expensive ) . growing up , i did n't take care of my teeth like i should 've , so i 'm accustomed to always being told there 's either a cavity , or the start of one , and having to have more work done . after the root canal , my mom recommended a brush that had at least a certain number of pulsations/oscillations , because that 's what she 'd been recommended by her dentist to combat her receding gums . this specific item met those requirements , and it was affordable . when i first started using it , my gums were very sensitive to it , but that quickly wore off , so it seems to me that it strengthens the gums . it is also much easier to get behind the front teeth . subsequent dentist vists by my mom have shown that her gums have improved dramatically after using a high-quality electric toothbrush such as this one ( i honestly do n't remember if she has this exact model , but ours are similar ) , and i 've not needed any work done at the dentist beyond regular cleanings since i purchased it . as far as cleaning the unit to keep it from `` gunking '' up , i 'm the only person who uses this item , so any extra toothbrush heads are still in the package they came in , not dripping into the storage container ; so i do n't know how to combat that . but i just take the toothbrush head off the thing and rinse it , then rinse the hand-held part , and set them back on the unplugged charger/base ( i only plug it in when the battery runs low ) and things stay clean with no problem
health	easy to use ; and a wicked incentive to lose weight . have lost 20 kilos in just a few months from walking .
health	this stuff does not work at all ! i tried this because it was the only one of the lens repair solutions that did n't have negative feedback , save yourself money and do not buy this product . it looks just like nail polish and leaves the same kind of film on your lenses
health	this is easy to use and set up . it even has a 3rd space for a guest . you do n't have to get your body fat and water each time . i like it
health	i love this product ! i deal with a lot of stress ( dont ' we all ) and was feeling edgy and nervous all the time . i couldnt ' even enjoy my grandkids . since i started taking calm advantage those feelings are gone and i can relax and enjoy life again . i would definately recommend it to anyone
health	the charlatans who makes this [ ... ] deserve to be shot and so does anybody stupid enough to buy it . eat a balanced diet and get some exercise . do n't be a moron all your life .
health	out of all the hair striaghters i have owned and i have gone through about 6 this is the best one yet ! i really like it ! it straightens my hair perfectly , and you cant beat the price
health	there are two thing that i do n't like about this set . the curlers get too hot to handle and the lid is n't attached to the base which is very inconvenient . i would n't recommend them
health	i purchased this humidifier , and it worked wonderfully with a soothing blue night light for my son for about a week . one night , it just stopped producing that humidifying mist and could not be coaxed into working again . i called the company , who told me to promptly cut the cord and throw it out , and they would be sending a new one to replace it ( with no cost for shipping to me ) . i received the new one a week later , which to my disappointment , did not have the nightlight feature . i also noticed it was from a different brand company . i ca n't remember the name but it also began with the word `` sun . '' so far , the new humidifier is working fine ( about 2 weeks now ) , but it has a lower water capacity so i have to refill it every night ( vs. every 2 nights with the original one ) and the lack of the nightlight is a big disappointment . the process of replacing , however , was very smooth and also free so i 'll give them 2 stars for that
health	i 've tried this razor for 5 weeks , both wet and dry and can only say that this is the worst electric razor that i 've ever used . it does n't give a close shave and requires a second shave with a standard razor to remove some of the stubble . i should have bought a new norelco instead of this . my old norelco always shaved me close . this panasonic would still be handy as a travel razor , or to be used in a pinch . but for a close shaving everyday razor , this is n't the one to buy . oh well , i waited too long to send it back
health	there are a lot of positive comments about this mirror and some very negative comments . i weighed both before i made my decision and chose to give more weight to the positive comments . i am glad i did . the light from the mirror is bright , the slide bar for the different light settings works very well . if you hold the switch to the count of 2 or 3 and then release the lights work every time . i enjoy the mirror very much and would buy another or recommend that someone buy it for their use . the only negative i have about the mirror is that the flourescent tubes buzz a little but i am getting accustomed and learning to tune them out .
health	i had a horrible cold , felt like complete # # # # but i had to work . this little two ounce vitamin b shot knocked the crappy feeling outta me and i was able to get some work done . there really is no crash and the taste is n't that bad . ..it tastes like a melted freeze pop . note : it may give you the jitters if you drink it on an empty stomach
health	the bad news first : does n't seem to work well without adding extra detergent it seems like this is not 3x concentration , and like others we found we had to compensate by adding more detergent than the directions said to get the same results as we did with the standard formula . otherwise , the two products , 'concentrated ' and 'standard srength ' are the same . make no mistake about it - this is concentrated comes out like heinz ketchup : it does seem to be concentrated , and we did notice a certain amount of difficulty getting the detergent out of the bottle , kind of reminded us of heinz ketchup . 4-star or 5-star product ? the standard strength product is clearly a 5-star product , however owing to the fact that this product does not work as well without adding more detergent than the direction claim , it rates 4-stars with our family . trying to learn objective info on laundry detergent is well . . . . the following is true of this product in standard strength or 3x with extra detergent added : i am allergic to most laundry detergents , but this product has prevented severe discomfort for me for about 10 years . it is consistently among the lowest-priced detergents available . in addition to being very easy on clothes and skin , it does work quite well in the stain-removal department and can be used as its own presoak . this is good to know if you are like me and are trying to avoid allergens . it is important to remember that if you buy a hypoallergenic powder detergent instead of a liquid like this , you may have to pre-soak stains and you wo n't have a hypoallergenic liquid with which to do it . while `` tide '' and `` cheer '' are also available in hypoallergenic formulas , [ `` tide free '' is actually just unscented ] they are considerably more expensive and work no better in my experience . that 's why i like this `` all liquid detergent - free clear , laundry detergent '' . objective information is tough to find ! i actually did conduct a hard target search for true , objective information on laundry detergents . there is very little beyond which brand causes pollution which , while important , is not what i was trying to find . `` consumer reports '' does have test comparisons of the most popular brands in its monthly magazine every couple of years and they do include some detail . about `` all 's website '' if you are looking for this product 's website it is under `` unilever '' and you will have to specify `` usa '' under products , as the word `` all '' will show up in almost every search result . you will find `` wisk '' and `` breyer 's ice cream '' and almost as many neat name brand products as you would at procter and gamble 's site .

health	the braun ls-5550 silk bodyshave rechargeable cord/cordless women 's shaver is absolutely useless , not fit for purpose
health	these wipes are great . i have three children and have used the pampers , huggies , and house-brand wipes . the huggies are too thick and it seems you need more of them to get the job done . house-brand do n't smell as good and tend to be a bit rough . the pampers are thin , soft , and moist enough to get the job done-because they are thin , they can be maneuvered around in all the important places and folded / refolded for 100 % useage ( unlike the huggies that once they are folded they become too thick to maneuver ) . definitely not too dry as other reviewers have said . if you want something moister , go get a paper towel and wet it with water
health	the product is all smoke and mirrors . unless you have a clean room and are incredibly talented , you will not have lenses that are usable . in fact , several attempts to use the product resulted in lenses that were worse
health	i used this to get marks off my washer and dryer and then went on to clean the rest of the house ! this little `` sponge '' is awesome , and it is just like a sponge ; it 's not abrasive . the only problem i see with it ( and all cleaning products ) is that you actually have to use it for it to work ; lol
health	this is the best bargain for your money.pampers swaddlers are better than pampers . even better than costco brand . worth every penny
health	i have tried a gazillion of these `` diet '' protein bars . this is the only one i 've actually found so far that tastes good .
health	i luv this burberry . pple always comment anytime i wear it . my girlfriend almost made me stop wearing it cos she said anytime i wear it she feels like doing things i ca n't mention here 2 me , and since she feels tht way , other women will certainly feel like tht . i 'm getting another one ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! also fast and proper services by amazon
health	the roller balls are excellent ! the rolling action and three different speeds are excellent as well . the only drawback is the mesh over the pillow . it is abrasive to the skin . i have had to put a thin pillow case on top of it and that solved the problem . the only other problem is it has a hard area where your head lies so you must make sure you are situated properly . other than that , it is the best machine on the market i have found and i have tried many
health	we all have very pale skin in my family , and these are great little `` i forgot to put on sunscreen '' helpers ! i keep one in the car , one in my purse , etc. , so we are never without one . excellent product , and easy to use
health	i bought the remington mb-300 mustache and beard trimmer for my husband and was holding my breath as he is very picky . he has a gorgeous full beard and keeps it precisely trimmed . the remington has several adjustments for length , that pleases him the most , it trims whatever he aims it at , and does it well . it is light weight and maneuvers easily .
health	looking for something small and portable ? this is perfec
health	had to return this b/p cuff . could not get it to work properly . medical devices need to be made a great deal better than this one..
health	i agreed with all the criticism that the revlon eyelash curler ( now discontinued ) received . it broke quickly and used up batteries by the truckload . but the one thing it did well that the carmen curler does poorly is to provide the type of construction and shape that keeps you from accidently squeezing pieces of eyelid skin . this instrument catches my skin very easily and it 's hard to get good curled lashes without hurting my eyelids
health	great enginering , design and craftmanship ; works great every day ; but i had to throw away a travel size `` waterpick '' after 18 months , because it is impossible to obtain a replacement hose assembly from the manufacturer or anywhere else . it does n't make any sense to supply an irreplaceable disposable part , on an equipment designed to outlast it three times
health	when i get a sinus infection , it stays and builds much congestion . rx and over-the-counter has limited value . one event that led to my first ( i am 69 ) severe asthma event , which messed up my immune system and led to my first angina events which the brought open heart surgury . neilmed pre-mixed packets sound like the `` minor leagues '' compared to the above . when a thorough cleansing is needed to make the sinus areas hostile to infection , these little packets take the mess out of measuring your own salt and soda ( i.e . to make a mistake is painful even with the right salt ) . then there is a $ 15 price in local stores for 100 packets , or about the same on-line for 200 . also a quick response from the vendor .
health	my girls bought this for their step dad for his birthday . he wo n't even listen to it any more because he has to reset the station every time he turns it on . we can never find the station we like without having another radio on to find it . the main reason he quit listening is because after i spent time trying to set the station in the morning , during his shower the station would automatically change to another one , give me a break ! this is a worthless radio , it does n't even deserve 1 star
health	of little or no use - much to difficult to use when you are excercising - i find this product totally unacceptabl
health	the good : the massage function works fine , no problems with the performance , and the battery holds a good charge . the bad : how much money is saved in construction by using the cheapest foam padding imaginable ? the ugly : the 'pebbled vinyl ' material on the arms is already separating after six months . maybe a cheaper material could have been found ... but i doubt it . overall good in theory , but very poor in execution . if some real quality were put into the product , it would rate potentially 5 stars . 'til then , you 've been warned ... .
health	it did what it was supposed to do , and my bras came out of the wash without any weird creases . however , some bras hold up better in the washing machine than others , and i think the one i put into the brababy was one of the more durable ones . while it does what it 's supposed to , it definitely is not easy to use . i had difficulty putting a b-size cup in without squishing the bra . the clasp is also badly designed . if it breaks , it 's not a big deal to tie the outer ball closed , but the whole thing is poorly engineered . i think it was made even harder seeing as how i tried using the brababy with a front-closing racer back . in the end , i think it would have been easier and just as effective to use a lingerie bag . i do n't recommend this product
health	i have been looking for a overbed table so that i could use my laptop and watch tv in the bed room . and this is the one i have been looking for . it takes about 15 mins for me to put it all together . did not have any problem at all
health	the jerdon 7p7506cf ( or as i call it , the ol'6cf ) is a nice , reflective wall-attachable mirror . i ca n't say enough about how reflective this thing is ; i 'm a bit of an amateur facepainter ( although i have zero artistic ability- my spider-man faces usually end up looking like spotty tomatoes ) , so i need a good mirror whenever i self-paint . i have gone through three similar models before finding the 6cf , and none has been as clear and user-friendly . in short , if you 're looking for the best mirror value for your dollar , i ca n't recommend this thing enough . it 's the mirror of the 21st century , and beyond
health	i love this product ... it is so well worth the money if you 're experiencing a skin problem . easy to use , portable , no lotions or creams needed ... just my little leather case
health	i really like this sanitizer . the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because i wish that it was bigger so i could fit bottles and things slightly larger in it . but , i do put her pacifiers and bottle nipples in there .
health	this product may be good for something but it is not good for plucking your own face . i was very disapointed in it . the tweezers were hard to push together . the light was too narrow to be helpful . the product was hard to position is a way that the magnifier could be used . i tried to use it several times and always got frustrated .
health	i had a good massaging heating pad that was great , and i used it on my legs a lot. , thought i could replace it . this one is not even in the ballpark . absolutely useless , i have been had
health	my wife had high bp , so we got this model . the reasons for choosing this model were that : 1. the upper arm monitors are supposed to be more accurate 2. it was cheaper than the fully automatic models 3 . omron seems to be one of the better/best brands . 4 . supposedly , the pumps on the fully automatic models are prone to breaking . the unit appears well built ( including the hand pump ) . it is easy to operate , and it seems very accurate . we checked its readings with an fully manual unit that we have at home , and the automatic unit at the drug store . we find it takes very accurate and consistent readings . people with physical limitations might find the hand pump inconvenient . also , people with a big arm might need to buy the larger cuff . i 'm overweight right now , so the cuff barely fits my arm , but fits my wife 's nicely ( it was bought for her )
health	every time we used this scale it gave a drastically different weight . we returned it to amazon , probably the first time we 've ever had to do that . for the price it should at least work . also , in only the 4 days we had it a large chip came off the corner . it earns two stars for looking great . i would not recommend it .
health	it was so so , and didnt see any real results . but it was definently better than tend skin or mi
health	i bought the goggles and was excited by the look . they are kind of `` riddick '' like . they had disappoiinting performance when i rode my jet ski at 65 mph and they flew off my face . they did float and so i found them and tried it a second time and same thing happened . i gave them to my daughter and she will try to wear them skiing . they definately are not for extreme sports . they are also too big for casual use as sun glasses .
health	this one is too small for a bedroom , just like a toy . i returned this one and reordered sunbeam 701-000 ultrasonic humidifier , which is much bigger . generally speaking , the ultrasonic humidifier is much quieter than the regular ones
health	i have not tried the product yet as it is a stocking stuffer for my four year old . the ad displays four soaps when in fact you only receive one . i would not have purchased one bar of soap had i have known .
health	this product was not as i expected . it is much weaker than ones used in the past . it certainly was not worth the price i paid . i returned this item .
health	the shave gel bars that are attached to this razor extend out past the razor making a close shave nearly impossible . this razor worked ok on my legs where an extreme smoothe surface is not necesssary . but using this on the the more intimate areas is just frustrating because the gel bars did not allow the razor to get close enough to the skin . this razor does not poduce a light lather , it is more like a slime that drips from it . i did not notice a tropical scent
health	i know that i am at an fpo address so that makes it more difficult to send and receive parcels but , to have never gotten the parcel is unsatisfactory . i never got the item that you wish me to make a review on . send it to me and i will gladly use it and then review it
health	i 've had other razors and believe me , this one is the most reliable on i 've had ! it works well , does not hurt ? ( maybe the people who had one that pinches or hurts them got a bad one ? ) a feature i like and use often is the head pops up to cut longer hair ... unfortunately at times i need this before i use the regular cutter . battery life is acceptable , power is good , and just a few swipes is all you need . you really ca n't compare a blade razor to an electric- they are not yet comparable for cutting or time used . this razor , however , has a better level of shaving than other electrics , closer to a blade than the others . in convenience an electric is much better than any blade- you can use it anywhere , dry , just sittin ' around
health	i agree with the other reviews . it was a huge disappointment that it did n't heat the water . it is only supposed to maintain the temperature , but after using it for about 20 minutes , it did n't even do that . the manual rollers hurt my feet and it sloshes water around and spills it when you move your feet back and forth . back to the store indeed
health	i never thought that i could get my hair straight enough to actually like it . until i found this vs sassoon straightener . it is the best ! ! i use it all the time and i love the way that it makes my hair look shiny and feel feather soft . i would tell anyone with wavy or curly hair who wants super straight , soft hair , to use this product . you ca n't go wrong !
health	i tried with two sets of new batteries , the goggle unit flashed but no massaging action whatsoever happened . besides that , the design looks cheap and it feels very tight and uncomfortable to wear . avoid this item
health	if you think you are buying the old met-rx bars by the same flavors , you are in for a very very bad surprise . the old bars had better taste and a almost cake-like consistency . these were so sticky that i could pick up papers just by touching them after eating one . also , i could n't get past the taste . even the color is different . i never finished the bar and i used to eat one a day ( years ago ) . i gave the entire box away for free . i will not buy these again until the go back to their old recipe .
health	these seem to be an excellent product . there is little or not leakage . the wipes were a nice treat
health	the best sports bar around . great taste , organic , contains plenty of antioxidants , and contains a good amount of protein . the only down side is the high amount of carbs , especially the sugars , but i still give it five stars
health	my wife loves this ! it was not too expensive , and she really has been very appreciative , esp for her eye makeup
health	for years i have had many a vacation ruined because i break out in hives with very little exposure to the sun . after my dermatologist recommended this product i tried it . two vacations later . . . not a single hive or sunburn . well worth the price . actually goes pretty far also
health	i did n't realize there was hfcs ( high fructose corn syrup ) in these bars . if you work out or are health conscience , then i would suggest doing a little online research about harmful effects of hfcs . i 'm about to switch up my protein bars .
health	does n't thiss say it all ? `` screw-on threads failed my shake spilled . '' i threw it away and use my martini shaker instead
health	clean and crisp . defined and smooth . i use burberry by burberry for all occassions but it is great for the evening . it has woodsy notes that remind me of autumn . i am very picky about my fragrances and i only use two regularly -- eau d'issey by issey miyake is my main scent , but i do use burberry sometimes on occassion and i love it . thats it
health	i got this product when the price dropped down to $ 12 . so for that price i liked this product a lot . it heats the lotion well . initially i thought it was small , but now i think it is the correct size . i did not realize how much better it is to apply heated lotion until this . i switch it on when i go for a bath and by the time i am back , the lotion is ready and warm . it is a great buy , and for all you bargain shoppers , wait till the price drops . it is especially a great buy during winter
health	optimum nutrition 's 100 % whey protein is hands down the best i have tried , and i have tried a lot of different shake products in the past 10 years . i used to be committed to eas and labrada , but i found that the shakes are too hard for me to digest compared to on whey protein . i mix it with water , and sometimes soy milk . it mixes easy , does n't taste gritty , and is pure protein . it goes down very easy and i have no trouble digesting it , plus it builds muscle when combined with a solid workout plan . plus , the price is reasonable .
health	i ordered this item for my husband and i was extremely disappointed . it is poorly made and basically is not worth the money . i do not recommend it at all
health	it was alright , but in a warm jacuzzi tub , it did n't last very long
health	the massager is top heavy and very heavy and will not stay on your hand . you will go nuts trying to keep the straps/massager secure on your hand
health	the toothbrush is great , feels like you just came from the dentist and had your teeth cleaned
health	this parfum is the most superlative of fragrance that hit the liquid stands today and for decades to come . it has such an amazing aroma it almost makes you want to eat it ! it is by far , in my zestfull opinion the odoriferous maximus of profumo ! i give this bold majesty of the monarchy , the ( il duce ) ! five stars `` ***** ''
health	omgosh i can not tell you how much i love this straightener . it makes my hair so soft its like baby bottom soft or when u sand wood for a really really long time . i love it . i use it everymorning.. at night i use the wet setting to dry off my hair and then in the mroning i finish it off with the dry settting . but i also use sunsilk pink bottle 24/7 creme . its an absolute must-have . to the person who gave it one star.. maybe yours was a defect . im sure everyone else who has rated it so far loved it . did you straighten it section by section ? it doesnt work if you do it all at once . i recommend this straightener ! its not that expensive and also makes a great christmas gift . looks nice too . enjoy
health	the idea is fantastic . the fact is i do n't wake up immediately like bzzzz -- i 'm awake . amazingly i can hit the snooze on a regular alarm without ever knowing it . on this alarm , the light starts glowing and gets brighter and brighter over a period of time you select . i have mine set for 15 minutes , and usually by the time the light has reached maximum i 'm coherent enough to get up . if the light does n't do it , you can add sounds ranging from a buzzer to screeching sea gulls -- ocean , wind , and ringing bells falling somewhere in between . the flaws : as others have mentioned , the light itself makes a buzzing noise at low light levels . so when it first pops on in the morning , you also get the annoying filiment vibration of the lamp . secondly , you do n't set the alarm for when you want to get up . you have to go through some math calculations , figuring out when you want to wake up and how long it will take you to get to that point . then you set the alarm for that earlier time ( awake minus groggy equals alarm time ) . third , if you use the sound in addition to the light , it does increase in volume as the light increases in intensity , but the sound starts out so loud to begin with that the light is really pointless . a workaround we 've found for this is to use the external speaker provided . plug it into the back of the light , run it across the room , and bury it upside down under some pillows . then pick a sound like `` birds '' instead of the lip-curling `` harbor '' or `` town '' . from it 's buried location across the room , the sound hits the right volume about the time the light maxes out . whoever came up with the plan of making the sound come on with the light was just not thinking . fourth , the clock lumination can change colors , rotating through the entire rainbow all night long in its default setting . at first that looks cool . until you realize a bright yellow clock glowing in your face at 2 a.m. is just wrong . the darkest setting is red , and the only way to choose it is to hit a pause button on the back when it rotates around to that color . so yes , it works . and it wakes me up without making me use my hammer . but the design is just plain stupid . if the manufacturer would wander by here , read this and make a few design changes , they could make a light worth buying
health	this product does a surprising job for its low price . it gives my hair so much body and softness , and is extremely easy to use . gets plenty hot enough
health	i bought this for my boyfriend . i needed something affordable , and this was it . the bubble machine is quiet , and the warmth of the water lasts for a pretty long time . the only complaint i have are the warnings it has . it just gets me uneasy and that something drastic might happen if i make a mistake . well other than that , this product is good . i 've had it for i think a couple of months now , and nothing awful has happened and it 's still working fine . :
health	but leaves a lot to be desired in practice . just get a small electric or hand crank food processor . this is not worth your time
health	i use this product all the time . it was becoming hard to find in department stores , but i found it available and cheaper online . i 'm very happy .
health	i have been using an electric shaver for 30 years.i have gone through 3 different syles of shavers this past year since my old remington died . none of them work well . what gives remington ? ? ?
health	i complete disagree with the previous review on that sonicare is superior . i 've used all of the sonic toothbrushs on the market and braun sonic complete is by far the best . however , this unit is nothing like sonic complete , the sonic energy is completely in the handle , it 's like holder a vibrator . the real sonic complete channels the energy to the brush head ... you are probably better more with one of the other two models of vitality that uses rotational brush heads
health	the sound of it working is great ambient noise for sleeping and wth oils it makes you room smell wonderful ! it does a reasonable job of humidification in my medium sized bedroom but it acts a little snarky in that it tries to turn itself on often when there is no water left in it . and it doesnt hold enough water to enjoy it all night but it will run for several hours . the light show and the aromatherapy can be quite a nice mood setter romantically as well
health	i was very happy with the prpduct and the shipping was very quick , even in the middle of the holidays . i will probably order another 3 inch memory foam from allsleep for my queen size bed
health	i bought two of these based on a 2005 customer review saying they do n't have automatic shutoff , but now they do . i guess this is considered an improvement , but i bought them for an elderly cat , and she ca n't reset the control every hour . they are a good value if you do n't mind the auto shutoff
health	having owned several panasonic wet/dry shavers over a 20 year period i can , with authority , say that this model is a big disappointment . the battery life is outstanding , but that 's because the motor speed is so slow it 's not using much juice . and with the slow blade action the shave takes more effort than with a higher priced model with a better motor . the next time i wo n't pinch pennies ; the higher priced models from panasonic are worth the price difference
health	this is excellent..i like the ease of using it and the digital read out is great . i highly recommend this produc
health	same as the other review . the thermometer will not turn on . i wo n't change the battery because i do n't think i should have to pay for it if i bought a brand new product . i will return it and buy a better thermometer
health	it usually takes forever for me to dry my hair , but it dried really fast and straight ! i can go a few extra weeks without a relaxer ! and the color is beautiful ... i just love orange : o
health	bought this razor and happy with it so far . it shaves close and is not as loud as i expected . glad i bought this one
health	i have owned the caruso molecular steam hairsetter for at least the last 15 years and would not buy any other hairsetting product . it is gentle on the hair and gives a wonderful , soft , steamed curl , as opposed to harsh , electric hot curlers . i recently purchased the new `` smaller version '' , because my old one - with the larger water/heating unit , burned out after many years of use . the old one required more water and a bit of salt . it gave great steam , filling the rollers with a lot of steam , thus giving a better curl to the hair . this newer version does not require salt , uses very little water , and does not have the steam making power the older version did . i am very dissappointed in this `` newly designed '' product . i have packed it away , and will use it only as a back up . i hate it when you use a product for many years and find they have upgraded , improved , or discontinued the product . sometimes , it is best to leave well enough alone . i will purchasing one of the older hairsetters on ebay
health	we recently bought the same model dispenser , but in the satin finish . from the first , only two of the three chambers were usable because the pumps did n't work ( yes , we followed the instructions carefully ) . two months later , another pump has given out so only one chamber is usable . instead of this loser , try `` the dispenser 71450 classic iv . '' we had one of these for years with never a problem and replaced it only because it was beginning to show its age . it 's harder to fill than the aviva and not as pretty , but so what -- it works , and the aviva does n't .
health	these are the best nursing pads out there . i tried several others that would not stick and would leak . i 've never had any problems with these
health	recieved product on time , and i wil for sure order from this company agai
health	these are hands down , the most awesome pillows , we have ever owned . they were originally suggested by a chiropractor at $ 60 per pillow , however at the time , a `` water bed pillow '' for $ 60 just sounded silly . what brought me back around to these pillows , was the year-long search that my wife and i had been on for the perfect pillows . one of her beloved cats managed to destroy our previous and quite comfortable pillows , which subsequently caused us to get caught up in the frustrating search for the perfect pillow . we spent a year , buying this pillow and that pillow , all to no avail . then one day i rolled the dice , and bought a pair of these pillows with the covers . the covers actually make the dish . these are the most comfortable pillows that i have ever slept on in my 42 years on this planet ! ! ! these pillows rate 10 stars ! ! ! just follow the directions and enjoy the best nights sleep you have ever had . i do not work for , nor own this company , although after using their product i wish i did ! ! ! our pillows are about three months old so far , and holding up exceptionally well . they recommend you change the water every six months or so , depending on what type of water you put in . the pillow is about half to three quarters cushion , with the water being the bottom layer . they seal tight and do not leak . there is no audible sound from the water in the pillow , as if you follow the directions , they will instruct you on how to expel excess air . these pillows and of those black decker scissors , have to be my two best finds for 2006 ! !
health	at christmas 2003 i was very excited with the $ 50 scale my family purchased for me . it worked as advertised for about six months . then it displayed the err message more and more . we replaced the battery . then it would not permit any function buttons to perform . we just sighed and used my expensive gift as any $ 7 bathroom scale . when it went completely blank this week , battery of no use , i hopped on the internet to see what anyone else 's experience is . to be fair , i will contact the manufacturer and see if they can make it right . i hope they can . if not , i will see what the weight watchers scales is like . sigh ...
health	this hair dryer is truly a professional , salon type dryer . many dryers are advertised as such , but this one lives up to that reputation . very sleek , beautiful coloring and easy to handle with turbo feature . this was a surprise ( turbo ) which i 'm enjoying , coupled with the smooth and strong drying . the sound is even pleasant , not too loud , and it works quickly . ( especially since i have very thick hair ) i would recommend this dryer as an excellent buy for the inexpensive price . aj in n
health	i 've been using remington 's shaver saver for 20 years . it keeps your shaver clean , lubricates well with not too much gooey oil , and works in an instant . i use a remington ms2-100 microscreen 2 , and after a shaver saver treatment the shaver glides smoother over my face and shaves quicker and closer . a treatment seems to last for a while and i do n't think it 's necessary to use it every day . usually 2 to 3 times a week seems to be sufficient and your shaver will continue to perfrom like new
health	the `` original '' glide was made by ( or used ) gore tex material . the photo for this product showed the logo for gore tex . the product shipped was the product now marketed by crest ; no mention of gore tex . the crest product is vastly inferior to the `` original '' gore tex
health	i like how quickly the rollers heat - a vast improvement over waiting at least half an hour . however , like the other reviewer said - i absolutely hate the clips . they are all one size , so they are too large for the smallest rollers . i also do n't like them because they do n't keep the roller still like the `` u '' shaped clips did , and they leave a dent impression in my hair . i do n't recommend them primarily because of the clip system
health	i 'm not sure how well since i have never used anything like this before , but my bath water feel a whole lot better and i do not itch for an hour afterwards . i probably should have rated a 5 star , but i really have no base for comparing . i will definitely buy this product again .
health	horrible just like tend skin . try princereigns or min they actually work and dont burn your face off like tend skin or magic shav
health	what a waste of money . not only was it just average in size but it was made of incredibly flimsy , really cheap plastic .
health	this scale was easy to understand and measures the same as my doctors office . easy to monitor weight and fat
health	delivers moist heat . great large size . you wo n't find anything larger anywhere.very relaxing as lavender is calming . only problem is it only stay warm enough for 10 min and heat really should be applied for 20 minutes . i have placed a heating pad underneath in it the last 10 min . and lied down with head neck in comfortable position and it did a great job . pricey but worth it
health	i love this . everyone can have their own data and we can track our own progress . it is very simple to use and the explanations are clear
health	great tooth brush.my dentist said my gums and teeth have never looked bette
health	this unit has the power transformer at the wall socket end instead of in the handheld part . the handheld part is mostly made of plastic . so , it 's pleasantly light to hold , much lighter than my wahl homecare thing . the supplied guard things ( that you swap to change length , etc . ; iirc they range from 1/8 '' to 1 '' ) have a curve on the bottom so it 's easier to have them glide over concave surfaces instead of digging the pointed end into them . this also makes things more pleasant . do n't believe the no-mess story , though . it really does catch most of the hair , so it 's certainly worthwhile , and it 's easy to empty the hair trap , but i still have to vacuum the remainder afterwards . it does n't catch it all
health	i bought this after using the inexpensive wahls for years . i love it for several reasons : 1 ) it cuts without pulling on your whiskers 2 ) it is very precise 3 ) it picks up 90 % or more of your whiskers 4 ) not only do you not have the hair in the sink , but you no longer feel like it will take a shower to get all of the excess hair out of your beard , if there is any to speak of 5 ) unlike others , i did not feel the need to have a more precision tool to trim my mustache . it worked just fin
health	the glasses are well made but i found them awkward to use . they did n't fit comfortably and it took quite a bit of time to get them on . the gimmick sounded cool but did n't work well for me . every head is different , so maybe they 'll work better for you
health	i am very pleased with the light output . i purchased them to light the inside of my childs playhouse . they really iluminate the inside as bright as a standard light bulb . i purchased a couple of years ago an earlier type lanturn by rayovac and was really pleased with it also .
health	worked well five times . then it slowed down and made cutting more difficult despite removing head and running water through it to clean , as per instructions . then it would run before cutting , but upon trying to edge trim my moustache , it would stop immediately , as if a single hair could jam it . removing head , as required for cleaning , showed that bottom part with its drive motor worked fine , with a rotating metal stub that fit loosely into a poorly made plastic part that moved the blade . it appears that this plastic part 's stability , shape and alignment changed after a few uses allowing hairs to jam its movement . a poor design that should n't have used plastic . do not bu
health	i had another norelco shaver for the last 5 ( or more ) years . the difference in the shaves is striking . both less pain when my stubble is a little long and closer . however , the reason this shaver is cheaper is that there is 1 battery inside it instead of 2 . i know this because i took it in to be `` repaired '' because i only got 8 shaves to a charge . i talked ( online ) with norelco and they said my shaver was broken . so , i looked up on the norelco site a local authorized repair shop . i took it in and the guy opened it up . he said it was one of the `` cheap '' versions that has 1 instead of 2 batteries . my old shaver , over most of its life , gave me 25 or so shaves before needing to be recharged . that 's quite a difference
health	i like the concept of no chemicals in a diaper , so i bought tushies . when my baby was newborn , they seemed to work ok , maybe because she did n't put out that much . she is now three months old . i practice attachment parenting so i know exactly when she has a bowel movement . the past two bowel movements the diaper has leaked horribly . she was sitting on my lap , she had a bowel movement , five seconds later i got up to change her , the feces was all over my pants . this has happened several times . the concept of the diaper is great , but the diaper needs some work around the legs
health	very nice trimmer . my hat off to remington . i have been using this trimmer on both my hair and beard . it words perfectly and is much better than changing spacers
health	this was a terrible product . i got little sores everywhere i used it . believe me , i will only use it once . wish i had my money back
health	this item is more of a foot and ankle massager if you have long legs . i am tall with a 37 '' inseam . this item is not made for someone who has longer than `` average '' legs unless you 're looking for a foot and ankle massage rather than a calf massage .
health	as others experienced , both packs each had two dead batteries in them . i am even using the juice family charger , so it is n't a brand problem . the packaging was a little beat up as well as if they were sitting around for a long time . sort of dirty . also purchased d batteries as well and that packaging was worse . hard to knock the fact they are made in china because let 's admit it , pretty much everything you buy is made in china . the problem is the poor quality control from the company juice battery themselves . these are actually ok batteries if they work , but not worth the price especially when taking the chance on whether they will arrive beat up or doa . even though still most likely made in china , stick to the main well-known brands insread of this junk
health	i gave this to a bearded man for christmas . to my knowledge , he has used it only once , with no complaints . was nice for the main reason , he had no electrical outlet in bathroom and had to drag large drop cord from another room to use old one . this one is so convenient and i am sure he enjoys it . purchasing was a breeze . thank yo
health	this mister is not for continuous use . had it for only 2 days and the bubbler weakened and barely gave out a mist . but good as a lighting decor and ambience .
health	i had never used an auto cuff before , so i had my doubts , but after using this over a period of weeks it seems to be right on the money every time . i would buy it agai
health	you know right away your teeth feel different , much like how they feel after a dentist cleaning . the dual action ( larger ) head is gentler and feels more like a normal toothbrush but it certainly is n't as aggressive as the smaller one in it 's ability to clean . if you can handle the smaller heads they certainly do a better job . the flossing attachment was also very effective
health	tastes better than most candy bars and has no refined sugar or artificial ingredients
health	while a little dubious , i am know a believer -- really helps me get motivated and stay energized focused for my workouts . start with a single scoop and adjust as needed
health	it does n't really smell like anything , and the heat creates dampness on what ever you put it on . but it is a good size and shape
health	this stuff smells bad , like a mix of medicine and pesticide . had to throw it out
health	i bought 8 size d 's for my boom box thinking it would be the answer to having to buy batteries every few camping trips . wrong answer . i was able to play 2 1/2 cds before my box was out of juice . game over . i realize these batteries lose their charge quickly by sitting around , but these batteries were fresh off the charger when i left . i figured they 'd at least last into the night , but they were finished before sundown . do n't believe anyone who says these are for high drain devices ... i got fooled . fool me once , shame on you . we ca n't get fooled again
health	i love this product and the lasting results . it is so gentle on my hair . i bought two , one being a christmas present for my neighbor who had recently had a very bad perm , and she agreed , makes the set last while not futher damaging your hair . if you are sleeping in curlers , sleep no more . this product is for you
health	the refills were easy to order fit my brush perfectly . it 's a lot easier ordering on line received in home rather than trying to find the merchandise in a store
health	in the user manual there is a whole list of people who it will provide inaccurate body fat percentage measurements for and body builders are one of them . i wish i had known this before . now i have to waste about $ 20 in shipping to return it . do not buy for body fat measurement
health	this may work well , but the cuff size is not as it is in the description . it says this will work on an arm circumference of up to 18 inches . not even close . my arm is a little under 13 inches and was too large for the cuff by far . sure , you can get the cuff to go around your arm , but there are indications on the cuff that have to line up for it to work properly , and there was just no way to even come close
health	it 's small , folds down and is great to pack for a trip instead of your big hair dryer . i just wish you could set it on cool and blow as fast cuz it does get pretty hot . very convenient item if you travel
health	do you want the real secret on how to grow your hair ? first , you need to have a healthy diet that includes plenty of vegetables and protein . protein ! then you have to keep your hair and scalp clean , trim your ends , and not use heating appliances all the time ! lastly , drink water ! that 's the secret ! you go on a hair care board and you 'll find people who swear by vivisical . they 'll show you before and after pictures and in the after picture it 's just the person with their head tilted all the back just to make it look like their hair grew 5 inches in 2 months ! do n't believe that nonsense ! if you buy viviscal , you 're a sucker ! you 're better off just taking a multi-vitamin
health	i bought this for my boyfriend and he uses it for his facial hair and to shave his head . its very easy to clean and does a great job
health	the plastic on the foot massager was cracked down the center with a thin crack branching off to the right spinner . i was not in the same state when the package arrived so i was not able to open it for over a month ... my loss . i do n't know if it was not structurally sound , or if the box was just not handled properly . either way , i 've got a dud
health	bought two of these . one as a gift and one for myself . luckily i tried mine out before i gave the other away . this thing just vibrates . no massage at all ! ! after 30 seconds you get nausea ... its not worth 23.99 ... its a piece of junk . trust me you are not getting a bargain . i guess you pay for what you get , but in this case i ca n't even say that because in no way will this help someone with a bad back or someone who needs a rub .
health	i wanted a cordless shaver because at my age ( 49 ) i need my glasses on to see the hairs i 'm shaving , and that does n't work well in the shower ! this braun is a good buy , easy to use , and works well if you follow the directions and shave slowly . it 's not as close or smooth as a blade and shaving gel , but it 's quicker and less mess , so i think it 's a good trade-off .
health	i 've had my first bottle of this after shave for a year and i have just finally begun to run out . while i do n't use it everday , i use it regularly and when needed . i use an electric shaver which often leaves my face dry and slightly irritated . this nivea after shave is wonderful . it only takes a small amount to cover my whole face and neck . it leaves me refreshed and smooth feeling . sometimes i 'll leave the house and forget to put it on , and i 'll go all the way back just to put it on . it gets your day off to a great start . no funky smells or textures here . give it a try , you wo n't be disappointed
health	i purchased the revlon facial steamer , this was my first purchase on line and i am very satisfied with the steamer and the service i received from amazon . the steamer is great i use it when i give myself a facial , i have not use the nail kit yet .
health	the oral b eb417 dual head power brush replacement does a great job of getting into tight places , reaching back teeth , removing plaque , has a nice gum massage action , and leaves your mouth and teeth feeling clean and very refreshed . the two heads work twice as good as one , but may take some getting used to if your used to a single brush head . using it by gently guiding it over your teeth , and letting it do all the work , it will last a long time too . it was nearly three months before i had to replace mine . most oral b brushes are interchangeable with all oral b units . this one though , according to the buying info here , may not be used with the cross action brush . it will also indicate when it 's time for replacement by the fading colors of the bristles . ( the box shows as good picture of new and used ) . just a little of your favorite toothpaste goes a long way too ! it 's a 5 star product , but unless you are just one person who just wants to try it out , the better buy would be to purchase the three pack . it 's almost like getting one free . my pack also came with different color rings , that fit on the brush at the base and is nice for families to tell the brushes apart . it 's nice to have a spare for unexpected guests as well . keep smiling ... .laurie
health	i do n't have a particularly large skull but these barely fit together on the bridge of my nose . i do n't see how the manufacturer can claim one size fits all ; as i said i do n't have a huge melon like mike myers 's brother in `` so i married an axe murderer '' . the idea/concept is great but ... i 'll probably return them . unfortunate because i was really looking forward to using them . people with really big heads , caveat emptor
health	this product did not work . i was faithful for 1 month with no results
health	it felt nice when my head and neck were resting on the real-ease , but the device failed to relieve the tension in my upper back and neck ( past the time i spent lying on the device ) . i 'm about 6 ' tall .
health	easy to use.it seems quite accurate.the only bad thing is it needs batteries , which cost a lot
health	i have had other bath pillows that slid around or just were not comfortable , either itchy or not supportive at all . this pillow is just right , and nice and soft , and has n't gotten exceptionally dirty or moldy , which i was worried about
health	the concept is cute , although the size makes it a bit difficult to store when you are not wearing them , but the main problem is that they give you hat hair , compressing your hairstyle with the band that surrounds your head . regular glasses go in between the hairs , so everything fluffs out . if you never take off your reading glasses , have a buzz cut , are bald or otherwise wear your hair flat against your head ( but be careful of buns ) , the clic connect reader may be fine for you . otherwise , conventional glasses are a better bet
health	i placed the order on feb 28 , but did not receive the package even on april 12 . i called the customer service , and was told that the item has never been shippped , while i do not receive any information about that . moreover the customer service even do n't bother to say sorry
health	we only use seventh generation laundry products now . it is amazing how much better our clothes feel with these products . the baby detergent gets the babies very dirty clothes very clean in our front loader
health	this brush is worth about 10 bucks . anything more and you are throwing money down the drain .
health	you were kind enough to replace my first order of these razors due to the fact that one never worked and the other wore out quickly . the second pair seems to be pretty much the same . one sputs and spurts and the other works only when i shake and tap it several times . i used to own another brand of these razors that were great , but i ca n't recall the name , unfortunately . i am very disappointed in the product , but i 'm very satisfied with amazon and the way in which they are trying to please me every way they can
health	i had a wahl clipper pair before . it was a good pair of clippers . the pair i owned previously was white and black as pictured in your ad . that was the pair i wanted again . the pair i have now does not perform like the previous pair . so i 'm stuck with the pair ihav
health	the pressure on the rain setting is so low you have to keep it on the concentrated spray to really wash the soap out . switching between the two causes a cold stream to come out for a second or two till it clears . also it is not sturdy - when the showerhead is moved to a higher position it does not stay and falls back down to the lower position . i will be returning mine
health	this flat iron combo curler is not worth the money that i spent for it . first of all it does not get hot enough to straighten my hair . although i must admit that my hair is very thick and wiry . if anyones hair is the least bit thick it will not work . i wish i had spent more and got the sedu since it had very good reviews . now i have to start over and buy a new one because this iron can not be returned if it has been opened . now , tell me how anyone would know if it works or not if it is not opened and used . `` duh ''
health	i am now going through what everyone else is talking about . finding replacement bulbs . for $ 20 this is unfortunately for some a `` throw away '' mirror . at least ours lasted more than 4 weeks
health	these glasses arrived yesterday and are the cheapest , poorly made , and most awkward glasses i have ever tried on . they are uncomfortable and look and feel as if they were purchased in the 10 cent bin at the local dollar store . pure garbage . do n't waste your money . [ ... ] i ca n't imagine that any consumer would think of these in a positive manner .
health	i have been using this attachment to my waterpik for gum disease for five years -- -- it directs the medicine into the gum pockets easily and helps save me from really big bills at the periodontist . it works for me , but needs to be used in conjunction with regular flossing , brushing , and generally good tooth care .
health	i have placed the order on oct 9th for $ 114.95 , now on nov 10th amazon is asking me to approve my revised order again for $ 125.95 . i made a mistake when i should have ordered directly from folica i could have used it for a month now ! the 1 star rating has nothing to do with the product quality , since i have not used it .
health	nowhere else in this country can you get this quality , accuracy and convenience at this price . fda approved and ncep certified , and the entire cholesterol panel ... no other at-home test can make those claims . as for my results , they agreed perfectly with the lab test at my doctor 's office . why would anyone want to waste time at their doctor 's office when amazon.com makes this superb biosafe test available to any customer . i 'm recommending it to all my friends . buy one today ! or better yet 2 ; get one for a friend
health	ok i picked up a corded vidal sassoon hairclipper at target . the thing was so absolutely horrible that i had to come to amazon to vent about it . the blades seemed blunt , if not nonexistent . it would only cut little tufts of hair , and the hair had to be taut , literally held by my fingers . it literally tried to rip the hair out of my head . my follicles still hurt from the hour or so i spent trying to shave my head with this terrible clipper . most of the hair i actually successfully removed , was due to scissors . lubrication and blade adjustment with the screwdriver had no effect -- the blades were n't *stuck* , they just *suck . * i do n't care how much money vidal sassoon spends trying to portray themselves as the trendy cutting edge in fashion maintenance -- judging from this horrible experience , they really , really do not know how to make a decent hairclipper . i have shaved my head plenty of times over the last few decades , and i have seen some bad clippers , but never have i experienced a clipper that was so bad that it would probably be bested by a haircut given by a sharpened stone instead .
health	que maravilla comprar por amazon.com todo llego en perfecto estad
health	i bought this hoping this will be better than shaving and last longer , but its not good , first of all it does n't remove all the hair and second its very very painful and very very slow , if you have lots of free time to spend shaving the most painful way posible ( i have done wax and wax does n't hurt compare to this ) then this is your product . other bad thing it produces ingrown hair the horror !
health	i 've tried all kinds of bibs , but nothing works better than pampers bibsters . right size , great pocket to catch crumbs , covers my 18 mth old , soaks up spills . i use them full time , not just on the road .
health	i have 3 of the priva ultra waterproof sheet protectors and love the product ! it saves washing the whole bed . just put a draw sheet over the protector and it saves so much laundry . washes and dries extremely well
health	ordered this item on sept 28 . they were supposed to ship it within 1 week . after 1 week i received an email , they said they needed 2 more weeks . another email today ( nov 7 ) , they think they can deliver it by november 27 . that 's 2 months after i placed my order . at this point , i am not even sure if they can delivered this item by the end of the year . fortunately with amazon , they do not process the payment unless the items are shipped and they give you the option to cancel the order , which is what i am going to do right now
health	i have a pretty complicating sleep schedule because of my graveyard shift at our local convenient store , with school and all it 's kind of hard keeping my sleep schedule straight . i 've tried many sleep aids and this one worked the best for me , no grogginess which is totally awesome for the days i have class early !
health	i got one of these to help me after i had major surgery . i have better than average hand and arm strength , but i found this particular model to be hard to operate ( i ca n't imagine how someone with a weak grip could possibly use it ) . normal sized cans ( like soup or beans ) slipped out of its pitiful grip . i wound up using it just to roll things to myself when i dropped them and for picking up clothes for the wash . this is definitely a lightweight ... too light for much real use . i should have bought the heavier duty version for just a few dollars more
health	it never ceases to amaze me how often gillette comes out with new gimmicks to take more money from it 's loyal clientele . the fusion is a classic example , from overpriced shaving gel to a much overpriced razor which quite honestly gives you the same shave as a sensor excel . do n't buy into the hype , the fusion is an expensive joke of a product .
health	shaves great wet or dry . i like it because it pivots real good . no cuts , it was worth every penny
health	i purchsed a package of these because the supermarket was out of my regular diapers and my baby is only two months and we 've been trying different diapers . i was instantly disgusted by the scent when i opened the package ; the diapers are scented and it does n't say so on the package . i would never have bought them if i 'd known that . the worked fine for leaks and those related worries , but every time i put one on her i was irritated . i want to smell my baby , pooh incidend or not , when i pick her up . i do n't want to smell the flowery perfume a corporation has added to their diapers . shes my child , she smells , its ok
health	not a bad product . irritates the skin a little , but does remove your hair . the only things i do n't like is that the buffers wear out quickly and your hair grows back with in 2 weeks . it does a nice job of exfoliating the skin and is great for hard to reach places . not a bad product ; however , i hope someone soon comes up with something that can take hair away permanently or for a longer period of time . i would recommend this product
health	i recently purchased this product and i found the motor power to belacking and the tweezer heads dont work as well as the emjoi ap99 aka optima gold . the price for these two items are the same so if u want the best for the same money , dont get this one , get the ap99 model instead
health	the topmost review described these batteries as `` aa in a d package , '' which is entirely correct . what certain loser battery brands like energizer do is put a aa battery in a d-sized sleeve , thereby hoodwinking unwary consumers into purchasing an inferior product that holds a much smaller ( approx 2500 mah ) charge than a `` normal '' d cell ( 9000+ mah . ) fortunately , these bogus d cells are easy to spot if the manufacturer prints the maximum charge on the packaging -- that is , 2000-2500 mah , which is aa cell territory . additionally , the fakes are much lighter than the genuine article -- inside is mostly air . too bad i mistakenly bought a package of these . i 'll have to settle for consoling myself by boycotting energizer for the rest of time .

health	excellent price and quick shipping . this was the best available for 3.4 oz size
health	i 'm more than satisfied with this scale . i was concerned that i would have to buy a more expensive scale to get good accuracy ( see reviews of other digital scales in this price range , ) but i 've tested it several times over several days , and my weight varies by 2 pounds or less over the course of the day . my first weigh-in of the day is pretty much the same as previous mornings , sadly . the neutral color ( grey ) and glass would blend in well with just about any decor , and the lcd screen is easy to read , with 1.5 inch high numbers . the only thing i do n't like about it is that it creaks quite a lot when i step on it , even though i 'm nowhere near its 330 pound maximum load . that problem is in my head more than in the scale : i do n't think it 's going to break , but it sounds like i 've got two people standing on it at once -- i 'm not that fat , am i ? an added feature is that when i 'm craving , i go into the bathroom and look at it , and know that it is n't going to fall for any of my excuses tomorrow morning . so the last piece of cake still sits in the fridge . the scale has intimidated me into not eating it . accurate , easy to read , easy on the eyes , and intimidating -- i think it 's a good deal
health	the oral-b is a good product but the refills certainly are n't worth what they charge for them . i do n't know about you but it has always annoyed me when you get held hostage by a company to buy their refills for the item they sold you at a rip-off price . they could make a great profit selling these refills at something like $ 2.50 each , their rip off price of $ 8.50 ea is beyond absurd . the other thing is that when you buy their toothbrush they have something in there like the brush heads last 2 months . that 's a real laugh . even brushing just once a day , you 're lucky if you get a month out of them . so not only do they rip you off with their refill cost , they also lie to you to get you locked into their product to begin with
health	we started getting a `` lo '' message when using the thermometer . it said that we needed to change the probe tip and clean the lense . this worked for a little while . we changed the tip on each use . now nothing works . after spending near $ 50 on this i feel like a chump . i want to throw it out the window . i 'm heading to the drug store now to buy something else
health	does n't work on coarse hairs . does n't remove , only trims . okay for fine light hair -- of course , if you have fine , light hair , you do n't need to try to remove
health	i purchased this hair dryer for an unusual reason : my old 1875 watt conair was actually too much wattage for my bathroom ( the circuit kept tripping ) , so i was actually looking for a dryer with less wattage . however , i did n't want to sacrifice power , as i hoped not to have to devote any additional drying time to my shoulder-length hair . so far , i 've been pleased with this hair dryer . it does seem a bit louder than my previous model -- not obnoxiously so , just a higher , more concentrated fan noise . the dryer is extremely light and compact ; it 's actually smaller than my folding travel dryer . it is very basic , with a choice of high/low settings only ( there is no heat/cool option ) , but it seems to dry my hair just as efficiently as my old higher-wattage dryer . overall , this is a very good basic hair dryer which gives you a wide variety of use options for a great price
health	i bought this scale because i figured the price was right . well , as they say , you get what you pay for . first of all , it is flimsy in construction . i am under 200 lbs. , yet when i step on it , the cheap plastic bends down . you can just feel how thin and unsubstantial the plastic is . next , the first time i weighed myself , i found that i had lost 7 lbs . overnight ! if only this were true . i did n't believe it . i stepped off and got back on and i had gained back 5 of the lost pounds . off and on again -- and i was up another 4 . if you like to just kind of average your many readings , then this scale will work for you . otherwise , take a pass . btw , and i was using it on a flat hard surface .
health	this is a very good product . it helps prolong the life of the electric razor
health	i do n't know what those other people were talking about but this energy drink tastes like melted popsicles . it 's basically just gatorade with more sugar in it . if you want an energy drink instead of a sweetened sports drink you should look elsewhere
health	this stuff is awesome for hangovers . it was like my high school staple ! i mean , i went through like a box a week . at least give it a try
music	if you liked the original clerks soundtrack , then you 're sure to love this . thirteen years after we heard randall and dante rant and ramble on about hermaphrodites and name-calling during sex on the first clerks soundtrack , now we are blessed with the opportunity to hear these two anti-heroes discuss other pointless issues like racial slurs and which movie trilogy is , in fact , the real trilogy . and we , the clerks fans , get to hear these meaningless dialogues in between every music track . oh , and did i mention the music ? terrific ! kevin smith 's choices are so fitting for each scene in the movie . it 's not too difficult to imagine that kevin has been thinking about these track choices for a long time . in typical kevin smith fashion , the usual array of artists are included as well as some cool surprises . you 've got your typical soul asylum and alanis morrisette as well as king diamond and an unexpected jackson 5 dance number . if you have not seen the movie , please make sure to do so before purchasing the soundtrack . doing so is sure to give the songs so much more meaning as you listen to them . overall , a really good soundtrack compilation that is sure to please any clerks fan .
music	i deeply love the music of joni mitchell . it is for this reason that i feel the need to warn you , to dissuade you from being too early enthusiastic about this album aven before having heard it ( as i stupidly did ) . the fact is that so many people spend so much energy in praising it ( a new mature joni ! a return to the roots ! a brilliant acoustic album ! and nonsense like these ... ) that it is very disappointing and frustrating to see ( well , hear ) that joni has not changed from her foolish and useless music of the last 15 years ( except `` dog eat dog '' which is superb , but only from a lyrical point of view - musically it 's an '80s disaster ) . it is the first joni mitchell album that i felt spleepy listening . ok , some lyrics are quite good , but nothing compares to the joni of the '60s and '70s . so , i really do not get the point : it is so obvious to me that she has nothing left to say ( how painful it is to face reality ! ) , so , why should all of you praise her ? just because of what she did in the past ? ok , let us say that she was the greatest singer-songwriter of her generation ( according to me , much better than bob dylan ) and let us praise her forever because of that ; but i truly can not accept that we still flatter her in everything she does , even if what she does is boring and flat music pretending to be art . i would like to strongly dissuade you from buying this album ( and anything else from 1982 up to now - except , as i said , `` dog eat dog '' ) . if you are still trying to introduce yourself through the divine music of joni mitchell , try anything you want from the 60s and 70s . really , anything . try to be open-minded and let her music flow through your veins . you have to be prepared , for it could be beautifully dangerous : once you know her , you will never let her go away from your soul
music	i was so disappointed with this cd . at least 6 of the songs were recorded from very old albums ... .scratches and all ! they were so bad . i play two of the songs over and over ... the only two i liked . when i read the other reviews and there was mention of leaving out some of the songs , i assumed that they meant doubles of the same song ... .i was wrong . i do n't know why they had to add the scratchy music..a filler ? i would quickly skip to another song ... only to have to `` skip '' many times !
music	five stars may be excessive if you judge this cd alongside the greatest classics , but when compared to similar cds within the singer-songwriter folk-rock genre , this beautifully simple and powerful collection really shines . i find myself coming back to this cd more often than to many better-known classics because it has a freshness and originality that sustain interest . the writing , while occasionally a bit awkward , is consistently interesting , honest and moving . the themes of introspection , nostalgia , regret , and defiance are presented in a searingly personal manner . the song `` if i were a man '' is a rich celeration of the wonders women bring to relationships and the world ; `` child of steel '' plucks the heartstrings with an achingly wistful delicacy ; and `` take my body '' is a strong lament about the objectification of women . i especially love the pared-down guitar arrangements ; the simplicity really works with ms. cash 's strong vocals and makes me wish some of my other favorite vocalists would occasionally just get back to basic guitar accompaniments . i 've seen ms. cash perform live and , while she has other hits that may be more popular , this collection reveals her unique brilliance
music	it is beyond me that a record label would put this out . it 's so embarassing how bad he rips bright eyes from song structure , subject the production and even the cover art looks just like fevers and mirrors .
music	robbie 's flow corses through your veins causing a feeling of total ecstacy and rejuvination . to have a cd that has the power to lift your spirit and your soul is something i feel so honored to have in my possesion . hats off to robbie
music	the best scene in the movie is the italian restaurant scene with janeane garofalo , using a wry randy quaid as her foil when she 's not ignoring him . it 's the only scene that made me laugh . the scene with the playboy dad having three women in his home , and the one preceding it when his girlfriend 's excessive dinner fails to impress the little kids , are both weak . playboy dad is not interesting , and that character really should n't have been one of the three musketeers of this movie . the other dad , reiser , is uncomfortable to watch . his dinner scene with his daughter is good in the sense that it shows how estranged a father can be with his teenage daughter , but that too is uncomfortable to watch . the later scene , up in the treehouse when his daughter suddenly loves him , is completely unbelievable . the fact is , that particular girl would not say those things to her dad . she does n't love him . she does n't need him at all . she 's done with him . the stupid bit about randy quaid being a talk show star after busting into rob reiner 's talk show is just dumb . that does n't happen . if you want to write a cartoon , get warner brothers to draw it for you . have the road runner in it , or bugs bunny . the film gives us comfort food at the end , with the trite and meaningless advice to love your kids . the fact is that your kids need love from their father when they are young , but once they hit a certain age , in double digits , you are done . daddy just becomes the source of cash from then on . kids in their teens and twenties do n't want or need anything but money from dad . fittingly , i saw this film on father 's day . to sum the whole movie up , janeane garofalo is funny , randy quaid is kind of comfortable to watch although the script gets a little stupid at the tail end , and the other two male leads are just mildly annoying . the script does n't say anything worthwhile about the subject it took on . but it takes a subject on , so at least that 's something . it gives exposure and food for thought on the subject of how a father fits into his family
music	ms. melua is from georgia . her voice is quite like the swede , lisa ekdahl . neither has range or power ; both have a little girl voice and plenty of finesse . both have musical partners . in ms. melua 's case it is mike batt who is to her what nelson riddle was to linda rondstadt , except that , in addition to arranging and conducting and coaching , he writes songs . most of this album are her and/or his songs . they are well written and well treated . they are are a careful team abnd do not cut corners . mr. batt , among many other things , worked with steeleye span and art garfunkel long ago . the original sogs are interesting and liquid pleasant in rendition . but my favorite cut is her rendering `` blues in the night '' , which some might remember from looney tunes cartoons many decades past ; `` my mama done tole me ... '' it starts . knowing she can not belt it , instead she works it . one short note on steve sale 's engineering because another reviewer was crabbing about reverb and above all , clipping . perhaps because i bought it on vinyl , but i hear none of these defects . my set is revealing , and it reveals excellent engineering , considering the largeish ensemble mr. batt has assembeled . fear not , unless the cd really is badly made
music	this album is n't not very good at all . there are about four songs i like . first off , the production on this cd is disgusting considering some of the producers make great beats . then , the guest artists do a sub-par job lyrically . then , there are no new verses from biggie , on the album . they should have stopped with born again , because album will be a forgotten one , not a great way to close out the legecy of bigge smalls
music	this band is getting alot of critical acclaim right now , but i 'm just not feeling it . the single `` wolf like me '' is the only song that stands out to me on the whole album . it is a great song , but everything else is just blah . i think the band could use a different singer , the guy they got does n't sing very well or very `` soulful '' . the music is good , very original and the only reason i have n't sold the cd yet . i really think ppl need to hear this one for themselves before they buy . do n't be fooled by these 5 star reviews . just listen to the cd before you buy it . that 's my advice
music	first of all i 'm a die hard ufo fan , i own every ufo album not just the michael shenker cd 's ... some of you fools reviewing the ufo albums without michael ..1 ) do the band a disservice 2 ) are smokin crack , and 3 ) are very inept in your musical judgement . while i 'm a huge shenker fan he is far from the greatest guitar god , and i hate to break the news to ya 's but for overall sound/effect and appeal paul chapmans just good as michael on many a song . that bein said making contact is one of the top five ufo albums made ! ! ! ! the top five ufo albums any fan should get are ( phenomenon , lights out , no place to run , making contact , and walk on water ) along with the two live cd 's bbc , and strangers in the night . misdemeaner has some cool 80 's guitar and is an attempt at mainstream ( and they deserve to be mainstream ) so who can blame them , and some of these songs are pretty cool ... if , i might add if you have an open mind ( so that excludes most of you shenker diehards ) ... ... ... ..
music	i just bought this on cd as it was on sale through the cd club . i have the original vinyl , but had n't listened to it in years . this is one of the best works of music ever conceived , written and performed . it is absolutely timeless and each song impresses you more than the last . put this one on repeat and let it play three or four times . it just keeps getting better . stevie is an awesome talent and this may be his best . do n't forget how great music was in the 70 's . this work is one of the major reasons for the resurgence of 70 's music today by artists that were n't even born then . you can see quite clearly the artists that followed stevie . most recently alicia keys who would be the first to say his music is pure inspiration
music	i wo n't say to everybody this greatest hits is highly recommended . being that i never heard all of her albums , so a true fan may feel like some songs is missin ' . however for me , who is just really startin to seriously get into pop is somewhat satisfied with these and this is a 5 star collection to me . some of the tracks i love , a couple i do n't like at all and the rest i just like . my favorite ones are in order ; erotica ray of light beautiful stranger the power of goodbye deeper and deeper the prodution is excellent and i love the vocals . if your new to madonna , my opinion would be to start here . but a true fan can give me lessons .
music	too many people are overwhelmed with the more modern christmas songs out there today and are unaware of the wonderful music available on cds like this . john rutter proves his brilliance in arranging and conducting . the music overwhelms the senses and the joy of christmas overcomes you as you listen . this is one of the most peaceful christmas cds i have ever heard . `` wassail song '' is incredible , and if you are ever in a small vocal ensemble , this song is a must to perform . you will not be disappointed when you purchase this cd
music	i expected more african vocals in it.. thats the main reason i brought the cd , i recently became a fan of that kind of music.. it had like 3 songs on there that i liked , besides that this album is garbag
music	unless you frequented jazz clubs in baltimore or philly in the fall of 1955 , this would have been your first exposure to the miles davis-john coltrane collaboration ( a few tracks recorded for columbia , the label miles would soon be joining exclusively , a few weeks before this session were n't issued until much later ) . davis settled on coltrane as his replacement for the departing sonny rollins almost by default - no one else fit the bill or new the book . that they would stay together long seemed unlikely because their temperaments differed so much ( davis was a hands-off leader , coltrane wanted constant input from miles on his playing and music in general ) . stablemates ( a benny golson tune ) is the track that seems to draw the most attention . it 's an excellent composition , and although coltrane sounds somewhat tentative ( nervous ? ) , the performance is attractive . but my favorite side is there is no greater love , even though coltrane sits this one out : miles plays beautifully , and i love the emotion he wrings from the tune . true , this is an early effort by the group that would transform modern jazz , but it 's a very good session nonetheless . the group plays well , the rhythm section is rock solid , and they are all off and running . full speed ahead
music	i received a cd , the tango cd ( the best tango album in the world ever ) was defectuous , since it plays alright until the 12th song , but then the songs starts giving weird tones . and the 2nd cd acts the same way , since my tango album is a double cd.the problem is not from the radio , since my other purchase from amazon is in good shape , as al my other cds . the music always stops playing right at the same time of the cd , the 12 th song , so its pretty much a cd problem . i dunno whats the refund policy , or customer service number , its so bad , cos this tango cd is great . i enjoyed it much , until ... ... ... th
music	first they started out as nu-metal , then they moved onto metalcore , and now psuedo-death metal . it should be no surprise to the fools who listen to this garbage that they are clearly following trends , and after each trend dies , they just move on to another one . if my calculations are correct , expect a psuedo-black metal release . but , what about the musicians ? sure , they have a fast drummer ... who likes to trigger alot , then they have two guitarists ... who like to steal pantera riffs , and then they have the singer , who , well , sounds just like all the rest . atleast they dont have the dj anymore ( oh wait , they do , nevermind . ) enough of my rambling , how does this untalented group of posers fair up ? well , image if mushroomhead went metalcore . 'nuff said . avoid
music	this album is lame as hell but next to the air pollution on the airwaves today , this aint too bad thats why it gets a 2 . right before female rappers ( there 's a few exceptions ) , i hate all little kid rappers . even when i was a kid . i do n't like anything on this album , i still got the tape and it has n't `` krossed '' my mind to even cop the cd . if you like this kind of stuff , or you loved `` jump '' back in the day then i guess this is for you
music	hard , smart , creative funk can be a hard pursuit in life these days . even with the age of the reissue firmly upon us , finding a decently accessible funk album can be a real biyatch . thankfully , `` secrets , '' under the usually readily available columbia jazz header is probably just sitting there in your jazz section pleading with you to pick it up for $ 9.99 . should this be a hard decision ? emphatically : no . although i can see where previous reviewers are coming from , trying to compare this outing to headhunters is truly unnecessary . with this '76 effort herbs is definitely toeing the fine line between jazz , funk and disco but it all works . `` doin it '' is a super , super heavy funk jam and sounds like it was culled from the `` man-child '' sessions . and although `` gentle thoughts '' can be interpreted as a dated sound it probably stands as my favorite rip on the album . it 's got a great walking bassline and super funky breakdown and , as always , herbie dancing on the keys . go get `` secrets , '' do n't think about it . it 'll always be an easy go-to funk bomb just when you need a little infusion
music	about the band : dead can dance is considered the seminal example of the ethereal or heavenly voices genre . in fact , the name of the label , 4ad , which carried many of the 1990s dcd releases , is sometimes also used to describe this genre of music , which is a fusion of subtle electronics , vocals , drums , world music , and a near limitless count of instruments . brendan perry sometimes has been described as a gothic frank sinatra . lisa gerrard 's enchanting vocals are often sung in a language only known to lisa . i count myself among the many that hold these two musicians in the highest esteem . about the album : compared to more recent albums that are loaded with bonus tracks , the 50-minutes of into the labyrinth would seem short , if it were n't for the fact that i like to listen to this album over and over again . i count this album as one of my all time favorites , and certainly my most prized dead can dance cd . one of the nicest things about this album is that it features nearly equal amounts of both lisa 's and brendan 's ghostly vocals . on some tracks they accompany each other , while others feature only one of the artist 's chilling or mystical sounding vocals . simply put , this is beautiful music to relax to . i honestly give this album my highest recommendations ! two tracks i 'd recommend sampling : `` towards the within '' ( featuring lisa 's vox w/ brendan backing ) and `` tell me about the forest '' ( featuring brendan 's vox ) . i believe they best represent the range of songs you can expect with this album . please note that while all the tracks feature vocals , the lyrics for only those sung in english are included in the liner notes . similar artists : chances are if you are n't yet familiar with dead can dance , that you 've not yet discovered some of these other bands , but i highly recommend them as well : das zeichen , impressions of winter , love is colder than death , qntal , corvus corax , or helium vola . there is a rather large ( and somewhat underappreciated ) range of artists still producing heavenly voices music that is similar in quality to dead can dance . please check some of them out as well .
music	this album made me realize that darn record company produces , for examle , two regular albums ; two best albums ; two tribute albums ; and finally two mixture of everything under a sounds-like-new-but-actually-an-old albums from a musician . this is an example of the mixture of previously released , re-released , at last , over-released best tracks with a sounds-like-regular album title . let me tell you one thing . jp is dead and gone since rob left the band . i doubt there will be more regular jp albums but you 'll have plenty of compilations like this coming out until you stop buying
music	i find it utterly disturbing how simple it is for a talented d.j . to round up 3 bafoons and exploit their childish and idiotic personalites all for their dirty dollar ; ripping off the kids droned and purged on the mtv feedbag , and this man paul wall probably gets under my skin more then any of them . notice his rhymes do n't descend any futher than his mouth , his car and his money . what excactly does that say to me about my life or the world around me ? does it reach artistic heights ? or is it just another jackass looking for his 15 minutes of fame ? and still people eat it up like chicken n dumplin 's on a cold winter 's day this is excactly whats very wrong with today 's hip hop , it 's all capitalizing on mindless club music artistic talent is down the toilet infinitely stay away from this awful garbage do n't let mtv rob another cen
music	other than that this is a proper introduction to the heavster
music	gun 's roses came out in the nick of time . record companies were mass producing cookie cutter bands and they all sound the same . g made their debut on the music scene in 87 but did n't get big until almost late 88 early 89 . appitite is a true masterpiece . welcome to the jungle , it 's so easy , mr. brownstone , my michelle ... .the list goes on and on . put it in turn it up to 10 and rock on ! the they made a mistake . they realeased an albums worth of great songs on 2 albums . so instead of another masterpiece they wound up with 2 ok albums . then they vanished . anyone who is a fan of the music but could n't care less about axl should pick up velvet revolver with slash and scott wieland from stone temple pilots
music	after reading so many positive reviews , i was very exited when i recieved this cd in the mail . i popped it in my bose wave radio , turned it up to 85 , and listened to the most annoying hissing sound i 've ever heard coming from my system . i regret purchasing this cd
music	as a former piano major i can assure those who would purchase this dusc that it is well worth it . reminiscent ( dare i say it ? ) of horowitz
music	a friend who knows my taste in music recommended vnv nation to me , so i got matter + form based on the reviews . in one sense i like it . the production is excellent and i find every track to be creative and unique . but i hate the vocals and so i ca n't bear to listen to the cd . this dude has the worst voice in music history .
music	this cd is 100 % pure junk ! the cd is sung by kids ! they have high-pitched voices that are n't even good enough to win the school talent show . the other singers are adults who have voices that are n't anything impressive , either . if the songs were sung by the original singer it would of been better . stop this s****y music !
music	this was the worst thing i 've ever heard , except maybe clap your hands say yeah . my cousin who has absolutely no musical taste introduced me to them and i hate them forever
music	it 's hard to believe this music is more than a quarter century old now . i think it would recieve the same kind of accolades if had come out yesterday . but it did n't . it came out in the summer of 1979 . it was the summer before my sophomore year in college , my first summer away from home . for at least a week , anytime it was my turn to put something on the turntable , i 'd select side 1 of `` rust never sleeps . '' it took me at least that long to flip the darn thing over . and then , when i did , for the next week , anytime it was my turn to put something on the turntable , i 'd select side 2 of `` rust never sleeps . '' my flatmates never complained . oddly , the songs i see getting the most grief in the reviews here are my faves . you do n't really want to do without the swooping lead guitar , contagious handclaps , and hysterically funny yet politically cutting chorus of `` welfare mothers , '' now , do you really ? as for `` sedan delivery , '' i have only the vaguest clue of what it 's about , but it 's sure a scorcher ( and it 's still hard to find a job ) . allright , maybe we do n't need two versions of `` hey hey , my my , '' but which one would you delete ? as far as i 'm concerned , there 's only one song here that has n't withstood the test of time : `` sail away , '' which is innocuously pretty , but lacks the bark and bite of even the other acoustic stuff . `` trasher '' and `` pocahontas '' are both beautiful and mean in just the right amounts and places . poor marlon , poor csn . do i wax nostalgiac ? perhaps , but not overly so . this remains essential neil , which is to say as essential as rock 'n roll gets . it still sounds fresh and relevant . and fun . did i mention fun ? in fact , i 'm gon na go plunk it on right now , maybe take a breather between `` sail away '' and `` powderfinger '' to relive the lp experience . you should too .
music	i get the sense that the fleetwoods'body of recorded work is n't given the respect it deserves . over the course of their career , the trio recorded thirteen albums and yet this collection , as good as it is , is pretty much all that 's out there on cd , save for a few other compilations that cover much of the same ground . rock and roll has always had a soft side and it 's in this area that the fleetwoods really shine . their cover of thomas wayne 's `` tragedy '' is an evocative slice of 1961 teen angst-i ca n't put it any other way . maybe that 's the reason why the fleetwoods are given short shrift today : they 're the perfect embodiment of a ( then ) nascent teen culture 's soft and gentle side.this collection features all of their hits , some well chosen album tracks and the original pre-overdub version of `` come softly to me '' . if you like this recording , try looking for their original lps . ( my personal favourite is the 1963 `` goodnight my love '' album .
music	i never have understood how some people have an inate quality for music and some do n't . well , willie was one of those that definately did . it is hard to imageine the blues without the likes of willie dixon : the writer , the musician , the producer , the businessman . i listen to his work over and over again , each time learning new nuances i did not hear before . how incredible is that
music	wow guys ... how many of you are on crack ? ive given this album 2 whole listens an it still sucks ass . besides if i should have to listen to something more than a few times to know its hot then its wack . cause if you listen to anything enough you will like it . it 's human nature ... keith , ummm ... excuse me `` dr. octagon `` is a retard , mentalcase , and has no lyrical ability . half of you people like this just cause its so different . what he says makes no sence , and has no meaning . that which he does say that does make sence is nasty , and weak . his flow is awefull . his delivery is awefulll . automator does a good job on the boards making nice beats , but keiths lame ass f***s up good beats ... feel free to click that you dont agree with this kool keith d***riders . :
music	paul hardcastle is a member of a select group of smooth jazz artists that makes the format `` work '' . i was in radio and that format and also a music director for a former buffalo , ny fm smooth jazz radio station . ( wsjz 92.9
music	i opend the cd filled with joy till it started ; at the beginning i thought there should be some kind of mistake but no , there were no letters . not even one word , we could n't sing at all ; we just had the letters printed in very tiny letters but no guide to sing
music	anyone who rates this more than one star has mental deficiencies . seriously
music	remember the days when we were punks and we 'd gather 'round the phonograph and listen to some puccini on the old edison cylinders ? they held up to 4 minutes of music ! count 'em , 4 minutes ! then that hippie opera singer enrico caruso came along and all the young punks would listen to him , including myself . he was quite the singer . when i was a young kid though , the only form of music we had were the concerts . i remember seeing franz liszt play the piano in concert , quite an amazing virtuoso , and johann strauss jr. conducting his orchestra , those were the days . then they came out with those things called grammophones , which were even more modern , if it was even possible . but it was , because then they came out with a new modified version of the phonograph that all the young punks would listen to , lazy kids . i mean , you did n't even have to crank a handle like you had to with grammophones . and what 's this , 1 hour , a full 60 minutes of music , on 1 record ? pshaw ! 4 minutes of music was all i needed , and i was still pooped out even after that . in my day , it was bed at 4 p.m. , breakfast at 2 a.m. , then off to the mines . we did n't have 60 minutes of free time . i have no idea what form of music they have now . appearently , they came out with a couple other things after the phonograph . now all i see these days are kids with their fancy eye-pods ( ? ) and mp3 , mp4 players , whatever they 're called , listening to that `` hip-hop '' tomfoolery of theirs . you ca n't even call it music , it 's just noise . well , got ta get ready for bed now , it 's almost 3:45
music	this collection is a must have if you like the bee gees and do n't have any of their albums ... or even if you do . it 's one hit after another plus some i 've never heard , which is nice for variety . i could n't ask for a better collection - it 's like i had burned this for myself .
music	i do n't want to hear any more of their music on the radio . it is all just nonsense , and none of it should have ever been made . they are one of the worst hip hop acts in recent memory
music	being a professional dancer as well as a teacher and having seen hundreds of musicals , i must say i rate this as `` one of the best '' . the dancers are fantastic ! the music utterly great , the choice of dances ( from classical to rock ) is highly deversified . ca n't wait till i get it so i can play it again and again . as well as `` rock the house , shake my bootie , etc
music	look , as music goes , variations on a theme is part of any genre . this album , however , yells out `` leave well enough alone . '' a remix of sgt.peppers lhcb might thrill a person born in 1986 , but when you hear the real thing , you ask why change it ? this album is a total waste of a truly great disc . like gipeto said to pinocchio , `` stay wood !
music	crikey ! ! ! ! what is this chunder ? wait a minute ... .art students from `` down under '' get together and make fun little songs while watching reruns of `` the wiggles '' , decide they can market these tunes to an adoring fan base ! yeah , this stuff could be the soundtrack to `` forrest gump '' alright . `` run , forrest , run ! run as fast as you can from this crap ! ! ! '' and these guys are touring , too ? are they touring with barney friends ? there is not one thing of value to this other than that the cd itself makes a handy coaster for your foster's..
music	every thing he sings is perfect , i 've yet to find one song that does n't move me . this cd has some beauties . `` daughter of mine '' is priceless . `` steal away '' is very nice . `` one small star '' brings tears . this arrangement of `` voyage '' is probably the best i 've heard . his traditional songs ( `` when you and i were young maggie '' and `` mary of argyle '' ) are beautiful . i ca n't find anything on this cd i could n't listen to for hours . i truly love music and listen to it constantly . i find myself reaching for the mcdermott cd 's almost exclusively . i have them all , more please
music	as a 21 year old , i felt a little out of place buying this soundtrack . but , i was so excited that i had finally found a soundtrack to these two wonderful movies . imagine my disappointment when i could aurally pick out that rosemary clooney 's parts were not sung by rosemary clooney ! i do not recommend buying this album . enjoy the music when you watch the movies , instead . trust me , it 's better that way
music	i remember thinking when this film came out that few things in life were as cool as lloyd dobler . this soundtrack is also one of those things . this album for me , as for many i 'm sure , somewhat reflected my taste in music at the time , and even now actually . of course the biggie here is `` in your eyes '' from peter gabriel . who has n't that track touched at some point ? this also confirmed my love for the red hot chili peppers , and here we get a slightly extended version of their classic `` taste the pain '' . toss on a few from fishbone , living colour , and the replacements and you solidify this soundtrack as a must own for the late 80 's alt-rock lover . not to mention the goods from depeche mode and nancy wilson ( heart ) . in fact the only thing that could 've made this album any better , is if it ended with a `` ding ''
music	yes , she has a great voice , but this entire cd is so overproduced , so lifeless , so very boring that i had to force myself to listen to the entire thing - searching desperately for a track that measures up to the voice . she sounds as bored as i was on every song . i hope she wakes up soon before we all fall asleep
music	this album came out about 8 years before i was born . all the years , i still remember turning on the classic radio stations that would play wbss or billie jean . now i know all the lyrics and music videos from this album . this is mj in his prime . unfortunately , we will never get another epic like this again . michael is sadly a target in the media , but he is still a great music icon whether you like him or not . every song off here is a classic . one song i thought was unneccesary was `` baby be mine '' . but otherwise , it 's excellent . if you starting an mj collection , get this album first . trust me .
music	a truly glorious recording , just what i want in music , with brilliancy , sensitivity , and beauty . this is a must have for every music lover worth the name
music	this disc was simply a waste of my time ... very mediocre songs , heavy emphasis on sex instead of talent ... corey 's voice is below average ... .i get the feeling that corey clark is imitating a good singer with a viable career , and not doing it very well ... .clearly 'fake it till you make it ' is n't working here . the songs all sound the same , i kept waiting for something to get me grooving , but it just did n't happen . i think his ego is much larger than his actual musical potential ... he either needs voice lessons , a little humility , and some professional grooming ( and i do n't mean clothing ) .
music	i was anxious to hear an astounding modern yet retro dance disc from one of my favorite girl groups of the 80s . unfortunately , instead of picking up on the latest influence of 80s music in dance music , what we get here is predominantly disco flavored tracks that sound painfully dated , with some latin tones now and then . the only semi retro/electro tracks on here ( and my favorites ) are feel for you , love bite , your love is like a drug , and marc almond 's remix of venus . the two lead singles `` move in my direction '' and `` look on the floor '' are not even the strongest tracks ! and the remixes on their singles do n't make them much better . i appreciate the commercial direction the girls have taken , but you can still sound mainstream while being more sophisticated than this . take a listen to the new madonna or even the kelly osbourne ( ! ) to hear some infectious melodies with an 80s flair that do n't melt down into total cheese . unfortunately , i just do n't see us radio embracing any of the sounds on this disc . but of course , fans of bananarama should still add this one to their collection . it 's listenable , if not up to today 's standards
music	this is the album that all kenny g fans have been waiting for ! ! ! it was well worth the wait too . not only is kenny g at the top of his game but the vocalists are great ! the entire group of artists is so eclectic . thank you kenny g ! !
music	i , like many others , have been waiting for this album for quite some time . right from the first track , i was hooked . `` all my days '' is a haunting , melodic , heartbreaking opening to a fantastic album . `` breathe '' has a subdued yet powerful message . `` home '' is just plain fun . `` song for you '' is sweet , somber , and hopeful . however , i must say that the four songs version of `` orange sky '' is what i consider to be the greatest song ever written . however , the time without consequence version is devastatingly bad ( when held up to the light of the original ) . the new version is too fast , has an inexplicably irritating percussion , and just does n't dig into the soul the way the four songs version does . i will always be baffled by this remake . it is truly awful . its only saving grace is that the original is still available . but that is by no means any reason to avoid this cd . in fact , those who do not know the original `` orange sky '' may fall in love with this one . but it is my duty to warn those looking for an `` orange sky '' that matches the original that you will be severely disappointed . outside of this single-song complaint , this cd has vaulted to one of the best i own
music	without a doubt , this is a must-have for any fan of the go-betweens and the place to start if you are new to the band . `` a man far wiser than myself once referred to `` 16 lovers lane '' as 'the indie rumours ' '' the liner notes say in this fantastic re-issue of the go-betweens ultimate set of songs . no truer words were ever spoken about this amazing set . why this album did n't spawn at least five top 10 singles is a mystery that will never be solved . but needless to say this is a fantastic set made even better by the wonderful packaging and extras included with this re-release for those of you unfamiliar with the go-betweens work , this was the consummate work of their 80 's heyday , for a great many reasons . the music is bright pop music , crystal clear , but in no way is it featherweight pop . the songs are beautifully arranged , every instrument , vocal , handclap , and anything else perfectly placed with not a note out of place , but this can be said of nearly every go-betweens release . the lyrics , plaintive ruminations on love , are clearly written by two songwriters/lyricists going through the opposite sides of relationships . i will not go into detail here as the liner notes tell the story , but the interplay within the band as these relationships play out are what drove the entire release . each lyricist , grant mclennan and robert forster , gets about half of the album 's lyrics , and that is what makes the cd special . images of the giddyness of new love ( `` love goes on ! '' ) are juxtaposed with images of love lost in such as way as to be almost shocking . `` i 'm ten feet under water/standing in a sunken canoe/looking up at the water lillies/they 're green and violet blue/still the sun it finds/a place to light me '' from `` love is a sign '' has to be one of the best descriptions of how it feels when a relationship falls apart that has ever been placed in song . these themes are repeatedly dealt with in different ways , from young lovers meeting and breaking up to the `` old '' love of couples with children ( `` you ca n't say no forever '' ) having a fight . the bonus material in this handsome double-disc set is truly welcome . the videos to `` streets of your town '' ( still undoubtedly the best song on this incredible collection ) and `` was there anything i could do ? '' underscore the relationships going on in the band while not seeming too terribly out of date . the bonus disc of outtakes and b-sides is also a fantastic addition to the set as it includes several songs that did n't make the final album cut but are presented as they were at the end of the recording sessions , being nearly complete but having that rough edge of a final demo . the real treat come with the acoustic `` demos '' that are included . `` you wo n't find it again , '' `` apples in bed , '' and `` head over heels '' are played only by mclennan and forster on acoustic guitars , providing for an intimacy that is unmatched anywhere . to top it all off , the packaging ( including an awesome essay by british songwriter andrew male ) is exquisite , providing detail on the circumstances surrounding the album as well as any pertinent recording information . this is `` 16 lovers lane '' as it was meant to be heard -- enjoy !
music	este cd es excelente ! se los recomiendo a todos los que les guste la musica buena . robi es un gran poeta y filosofo
music	looking at the liner photos makes clear that falkner is the prettiest thing this side of n sync ( and does n't he know it , especially in the shot of him being served what appears to be a large dose of johnnie walker black by a leggy bunny flight attendant ) . which raises the question : is this the recond a boy band member would turn out if he got the idea he was an artist ? not to put too fine an edge on it , let 's say bluntly that this is a vanity project by a middling talent . falkner does everything on the cd and my reaction is so what ? his voice is mediocre ; his lyrics are banal ( `` life can be just like a painting full of wonderful strangeness '' ) or precious ( `` suspended on this stage of grace i have to remember this sound '' ) ; the layers of sound he tracks down are just that -- layers of sound , with a disspiriting sameness song after song . give him two stars simply because he can do all the stuff on the record , but this guy needs to become a whole lot less full of himself and to spend a year or two listening to , say , chrissie hynde and john hiatt cds . we 'll let him come back then and try to write and play some adult love songs
music	i ca n't believe some of the songs on this soundtrack ... they are horrible pieces of s $ # ! ? * % # ! # $ ! there are a couple good ones , but its not worth spending the money on for the c.d , not even at a used price.i ca n't believe they did'nt put `` low rider '' on the soundtrack , how cheap is that
music	i 'm surprised this show got past season 1 . honestly , more talent can be found in my local karaoke bar . this show does not discover talent , they produce and market it . it is really demeaning to musicians everywhere . the judges are a joke , i guess the producers tell them what to say . simon `` the jerk '' cowell tries hard to be rude to everyone , hey ... he has made a living out of it . randy jackson 's vocab is limited to `` yo '' , `` yeah '' and `` dawg '' . paula , who 's the only one who i think deserves to even comment on the singers..unfortunately praises everyone , be it for their performance/energy/character/looks/ ( fill with any word of your choice ) . all in all , a total disaster ... only in shows this sh*tty , can no-talents like william hung be hailed as a celebrity . i am shocked people other than the families of those participating would actually spend time and money voting for these posers . on a more positive note , it 's good that people do n't actually buy the albums , thus resulting in total disappearing acts from idol winners like ruben and fantasia ... now we just need the american public to stop tuning in to the shows . well , hope is all we have , right
music	despite all reviews posted here in this page are given 5-stars to this release , i need to be honest and explain why i am giving just one poor star . no , i am not crazy . let me explain my point-of-view , and after that you can decide if this jh album really deserves more stars . just to start , this album does not have a spinal-column that could guide the band ( ? ) or the musicians thru a solid path . there are tracks played by a duo , trio , 4tt , and sometimes a very loose quintet , and each of these tracks have a different mood , without any presence of a jazz soul , or even a real smell of jazz . maybe the intention of recording these tunes was to make a homage/tribute to mr strayhorn , or maybe a recognition for mr henderson value in the 20th century jazz history as one of the most important hard-boppers ever . but the result was very poor . if you really love joe henderson ( as i appreciate ) , try any of his albums from the 60 's ( as a band-leader or as a sideman ) , mainly those from the blue note era . in time : i gave one star , in memory of his brilliant carreer . this particular album deserve zero-star .
music	when merging female vocal yodels and copying elements from switchblade syphony , one can only be disappointed in diva destruction 's music . the positive aspect is the better production on this cd compared to their debut
music	except for the song , mother mother , i did n't really care for the rest of the cd . i bought it for mother , mother so i guess i got what i wanted . i had hoped to like other songs as well , but , oh well
music	i picked this up in a bootleg store in korea a few years back , since it was cheap , and i had loved the movie ( perhaps more so than any other of mallicks 's others , even - speaking of which , if you get a chance to see badlands on the big screen , do yourself a huge favour and do so ) . as i recall , i did n't really enjoy it on first listen . but then , somehow , i got sucked in . almost as much as the film itself , this is a hypnotic , haunting slice of poetry . nothing happens for about a minute , and then it builds and builds . unforgettable , otherwordly and quite beguiling . the structure of the soundtrack ( especially the songs toward the end featuring polynesian gospel-style singing ) is strongly reminiscent of the mike oldfield cd , 'songs of distant earth ' . highly recommended , but do give it a couple of listens , because it might take a while to make its charms felt
music	this is nothing compared to their ep , which was great by the way . songs lack of inventive , arrangements and feeling ... maybe a couple of songs are to be rescued , but no more
music	this guy is a freak of nature ! different but in the same vein as illinoise . i loved it..no fillers to speak of . if you liked some of the more laid back songs on illinoise ! , you 'll love this album . its great regardless . highlights are : avalanche adlai stevenson saul bellow the mistress witch from mcclure springfiel , or bobby got a shadfly caught in his hair no man 's land the perpetual self , or `` what would saul alinsky do ? s
music	i was a music director at a college radio station when this came out , and along with a ton of other albums this one commanded my attention . shoegazers ? ? ? i am sure all the label slinging yahoos are still wiping the egg off their faces . its as if the band heard they were pigeonholed and gave them all the big finger . just buy it ... and all the rest
music	i have been hankering after this great album on cd for a long time now . imagine my surprise to suddenly find out that it is available . surprise turned to shock when i saw the price . does the company that produces this cd not realise that are people all around the world ( including south africa where i live ) who are very keen on this album ? at this stage though , it is only the very wealthy that can afford it .
music	listen , did i hear someone say `` lack of energy ? '' get this album , as my lovely wife did for me last christmas , from amazon , btw , and listen to this lineup : fire water , mr. big , i 'm a mover , woman , all right now , oh i wept , stealer , walk in my shadow ... oh , get up off the floor , amigo ... see , it 's you that 's having a lack of energy ... i know , this music is like a workout , emotionally , aurally , and in the old pleasure zone too . rodgers the late great paul kossoff surely knew how to sell a song , did n't they ? perhaps these fellows were near the best , not only at the time , but in any century of rock/blues/git-down-kick in-the-mud blooz music . yowzah
music	wow ! there 's sooooo ... much to like in this album it 's amazing . the music is mostly upbeat very catchy -- making you want to ( will if no one 's around ) sing along . the lyrics are fine , meaningful , personally touching -- about life which is getting faster faster in the contemporary world , while people are still people with hopes , feelings , needs , desires , all the rest of what makes people human . the lead singer , jennifer nettles is powerful yet gifted with a sweet voice ( though a bit twangy in style ) . she grabs you quickly for a wild ride -- immersing the listener in the musical story she 's telling . i bought the cd based on hearing baby girl something more ( on the tv show vegas of all place ) . then i heard sugarland on the cma show -- winning awards as they so deserve . the range variety of the songs on the album are good too -- from sweet poignant ballads to wild spicy soaring . virtually all of the songs are well worth listening to the majority could become successful singles . yes , the style is their own mixture of influences -- the 3 artists come from different musical backgrounds , which makes their wonderful blending are the more impressive . and , the trio wrote all the songs on the cd -- with hall the primary author ( solo writer on one of them ) . how many trios are there with 2 women 1 man ? i wonder if they are unique ? well , they are unique even if not in that respect -- how many bands include a mandolin ? . of course , country purists may not be happy with them , but the vast majority of listeners are . this has become one of my favorite albums , at the speed of sound . imho , it 's terrific
music	when mike the mechanics ushered in the `madchester ' scene with the living years it was only a matter of time before these jokers attempted to jump on the bandwagon . if you want to be adored you should write some decent songs lads ! verdict : do n't waste your money .
music	hey there all , want to listen to some great songs by a country artist , chely wright , then go ahead and purchase this cd you will be amazed at the talent chely has . songs spanning from her ealier days to her current hits , a great collection for the diehard fan , and a great gift for those who have not been able to experience the very talented chely wright
music	come on . i can not play these dual discs in my car nor any regular cd players . j are excellent though
music	i think ms hewitt misses the mark , yes for an actress turned singer she 's ok and its more her acting clout that has landed her this record deal and not her talent as a singer ... would someone off the street with the same looks and musical level get a record deal ? i think not ... same goes for the other latin jennifer..
music	stick to singing in spanish , shak
music	maybe her harp playing could be acceptable , but when she sings ... everything turns awful . the worst singer i ever heard
music	several tunes on 'back to oakland ' feature tower of power at their best . one in particular that keeps me coming back is the deeply funky instrumental track , 'squib cakes ' . featured soloists include a short , mellow guitar solo from bruce conte , followed by greg adams ' fluegelhorn that first lurks in the pedal range ( leading one to believe it 's a trombone ! ) and then soars brilliantly higher and higher to a dramatic finish . tenor madness abounds from lead saxman lenny pickett ( known primarily for his work as lead tenor for the saturday night live band ) , wailing in-tune in the difficult altissimo range ( jazz musicians call these 'freak notes ' because they are not notes typically included in the range of the instrument ... ) , while at the same time refusing to compromise on excellent rhythmic and melodic ideas throughout . chester thompson completes the soloistic foursome with a chunky hammond organ solo that takes you back to a smoky bar in la in the early 70s - without the probability of cancer . lyrical yet hard-driving , thompson lulls us first into his solo space by filling in behind the band as they chant 'squib cakes ' , then takes off on his own flight , delving out perfect 16th-note runs as though bach suddenly had learned some jazz hammond himself . in the middle of the solo , as if to a testament to the tightness of the groove , thompson lingers on a treble note in his right hand , chunks out chords so symmetrically with the rest of the rhythm section with his left , that in the days of hearing this on vinyl , i wondered if my record was skipping through that section ! to finish the groove , at the end of thompson 's solo , the horns return to fill in a bridge with quick triplets . after he closes , we 're back to the head to close out the tune . even with so much to savor , this syncopated gem will leave you hungering for more , even after the final stroke of the last chord . the musicianship and tightness of their groove more than make up for the bland lyrics on the album 's other tunes . i have listened to this album for 30 years and revel in its freshness every time i spin it . i recommend it as a definite primer for anyone wishing to explore tower of power 's `` sound . '' - kathryn shut
music	david foster , who wrote a few tunes on yes 's `` time and a word '' is here on bass with tony kaye on the b3 and it 's the performance of their lives captured live at the rainbow . a brave but good way to record a debut album , album was produced by jon anderson and the cover drawn by roger dean , just like yes . it gives you feeling that tony left yes on good terms when rick wakeman stepped in
music	i had never heard leonard cohen 's music but saw references to it frequently when looking at other singers/songwriters . given his status/reputation i thought i should get this cd and learn what all the fuss was about . having had no preconceptions , i have to say i was quite disappointed . i think the music has not aged well and is pretty unremarkable . perhaps the style liberated others to pursue new directions but the work in and of itself is ho hum at best . specific example that speaks volumes : listen to cohen 's singing of his `` hallelujah '' and then listen to jeff buckley 's cover of that song on `` grace '' which was recorded in 1994 . sorry , leonard , you can not hold even a birthday-sized candle to jeff buckley 's rendition of your own song . it is a very unflattering comparison that pretty much put the first and last nail in the coffin for my appreciation of cohen 's legacy . `` tant pis , vers le bonheur .
music	i received this 2cd set in the mail and was horrified at the sound quality of the so called `` mastering '' . i have original un-mastered copies of some reo speedwagon albums that sound better than this set ! i love reo to death and the track listing is good to go , but in all honesty , this compilation falls flat on its face in regards to sound quality . the band seriously needs to find a good remasterer and give the fans what they have been waiting for . i can not recommend any previous greatest hits releases that even come close . save your money and wait
music	sombre romantic is a step up if you will in the gothic metal genre . it is a very solid album from start to finish but has alot of layers that keep things interesting . its not what you would really consider to be a `` religious '' album but there are many undertones that help get the message across . this point being made very clear in `` museum of iscariot '' which talks of jesus from judas ' point of view . rowan 's vocal stylings change to meet the moods of every song on this album , from low opera type to screaming , in a superb way that stays consistent and never gets old . if you are into relaxed darkwave/goth music this is a perfect album to purchase
music	sorry , bill ! poor lyrics and only fair production have made this a most disappointing purchase . the guitar playing is adequate , but not good enough to save this material . i hope bill spends a little more time on the thought process before bringing out his next material .
music	king elvis . queen madiona . prince justin . and now princess hillary ! duff is slowly making her way up to the queen of pop . it was espicially nice to here my teen idol singing all christmas classics with some other pop stars too . if you love hillary duff and you really need some new cd 's by her and it 's crhistmas time then this is cd for you ! let me tell ya somethin ' , that girl can sing . so go to the cd store . buy it ! play it ! plop down on the couch and have a glass of egg nog .
music	i purchased `` empty '' not long after it came out and it was fairly enjoyable , but eventually forgettable , pop/rock . this sophomore effort is , simply put , amatuer and sub-par . some of these sound like they would have been packaged more effectively as `` empty '' b-sides , while the cover of `` electric avenue '' never really distracts most listeners from thinking `` what is this and why ? '' over all , this might appeal to most christian radio listeners , but only because they will never scrutinize it for what it actually is : mold-fitting white noise
music	a true musical genius . take a blow get a zyr voduski and snapple lemonade and let the music cover you up . powerplus from the 70 's and 80 's . tight lyrics and pop masterpiece arangements . go todd go
music	`` maiden voyage '' appears on innumerable lists of jazz masterpieces , and it is clear from the first listen that both the composition and the playing are at a level of technical proficiency unmatched on most albums of this era or any time afterward . nevertheless , the finished product is not one that all listeners will find appealing . to these ears , this album seems aimless and even somewhat annoying . the songs meander without clear structure and tony williams ' drumming seems at times to be going in a direction opposite that of the rest of the band . the influence of this album is indisputable , but its enjoyability is a more subjective matter . if you enjoy groundbreaking , cerebral jazz such as the music made by miles davis ' second quintet , then this album will probably work for you . if , on the other hand , you favor hancock 's earlier and more accessible albums `` takin ' off '' and `` my point of view , '' this album may be a bit of a letdown
music	yes the game has been missing the constant songs about drugs , girls , cars and jewelery . i tell you juelz really came with an original formula with this album . the stuff he mentions on this one has never been said before and juelz is an innovator as well as the rest of the dipset . lol ! ! ! ! these guys listen to other peoples albums and just reiterate the same stuff in a different song and beat . save your money
music	a top quality recording with all of artie shaw 's favorites . artie 's music as fresh today as when it was recorded - with the power and appeal that hits you right between the eyes
music	blue note was on the mark to re-release this classic . tina brook 's style of blues laced jazz is a sound that will bring joy to your soul . a must have cd for any jazz collection
music	to those of you interested in this cd in lieu of finding the `` songs with lyrics '' in the movie ice age , got bad news for you . they are not here ! i really do hate it when a soundtrack is put out for a movie and they do n't include the best or features songs in the movie . anyway , the song that pretty much everyone wants when manny , sid , diego and the baby are together and walking towards half peak is called `` send me on my way '' by rusted root . it is on their latest album `` when i woke '' . put rusted root in the amazon search engine and you should find it . hope this helps those looking for this song
music	i 've always seen sheryl crow as a middle-of-the-road rock artist . my wife and i got a couple of her disc 's , plus that `` very best of '' cd and was really looking forward to her latest , but this one ... zzzzzzzz , makes me wonder what they 're putting in sheryl 's coffee . some reviewers are saying there 's `` heart and soul '' all over this album ? that may be , but it 's also very slick dullsville stuff too . as for the album cover graphics , i do n't see the roger dean yes covers or the 60 's style psychedelia like one reviewer wrote , but a very `` modern '' graphic art that lots of artists and bands have been using . kelly clarkson , the vines , the donnas , the list goes on . highlights : good is good ( i guess it 's time for a new `` very best of '' collection )
music	i feel bad doing this becuase i love iggy and the stooges but the quality on this set is pretty bad . all the live recordings are worth listening to and probably owning but the quality is very rough and can get frustrating . it 's like the first beatles anthology set : the material is amazing but the quality is bad . on the plus side the studio outtakes are decent quality wise and amazing content wise . the packaging is also very nice . i just though i 'd share this information before you drop all the money on the set . if you are a stooges fan do n't hesitate purchase now but if this is your introduction you should probably wait .
music	alvin lee is a genius with a guitar . nowhere is this more evident than in his mastery of the blues . he was and is a great rocker , but his true calling is as a bluesman . this is a great album
music	i can understand that robin felt a need to include some of the biggest bee gees hits to appease the fans , but the ones that were sung by barry are below wretched here . robin frequently disappears in the sound mix , becoming little more than one of a group singing harmony . that 's fine for a group concert , like the bee gees , but inexcusable for a solo effort . his stiff between song talk sounds like a bad lounge act . they should have kept this in the can . it seems like it is meant as little more than a money grab for robin . do n't do him the favor
music	i bought this cd for one song , `` walk away '' which was one of their best known songs . i was hoping since that particular song was so good that maybe the album would harbor a few more gems . there was n't . the rest of the album is like an anti-climax . i would suggest a greatest hits instead . if you see this cd just turn your pretty head and walk away
music	purchased this album because of the great album cover , was i surprised when i popped it into my cd player . i had n't heard of rick braun before but after listening to this cd , i ran out and purchased everything he has ever recorded . never have i heard a trumpet sound so beautiful . share this music with someone you love
music	a mix of the softest chessyest mushy reggae from the 80s . do n't even bother ...
music	one good song , of course `` the sound of silence '' , and the studio version is far better than this one . i am not a fan of the genre as you might expect
music	now i know what you 're thinking , why are there two releases of `` xx '' ? well after they switched from eclipse to universal records they re-released the album `` xx '' but they also re-recorded all the songs with less hard core vocals ( big mistake ! ) the original album is by far much better than the universal release in december of 2001 . if you 're not sure which one to go with go with this one !
music	it was my full belief that the next time we would hear from buju banton on an album would be on the now 2 years anticipated `rasta got soul ' album . the album which has still yet to arrive ( and may never ) was said to be along buju 's best and might actually rival his seminal classic `til shiloh . he even tipped his hand 2 years ago by releasing the album 's first single , the `magical ' magic city . so the world was waiting to see just how much soul the album had . however . between then and now buju has been going through so many events that this album , too bad , almost seems like a smack in the face to his critics . forever , it seems that he is still living in the `boom bye bye curse ' , and having some legal matters which prevented him traveling , he apparently has been angered by all the unwanted attention and the result is too bad . the album has a severe kick to it , it can actually sit not too far away from his `stablemate ' assassin 's infiltrate from `05 , in terms of style . the attraction here is actually the subject of `confusion ' . while we were waiting for a massive roots album to come down the pipe , buju has n't made a pure dancehall album in a very very long time . thus , the dj who was once the dancehall 's main attraction stepping back into the fray is n't at all a bad thing . so fans who sit longing for the days of stamina daddy and batty rider are the one 's who 'll be happy and i can fit into that camp as well ! but at the same time , buju 's concentration for the last decade or so has been the roots , so now it is there where he will ultimately excel . however , with the current trend in dancehall to revive older riddims , you may find yourself feeling like 1991 all over again . the best tune here is probably the hard hard `til it bend . til it bend is serious serious rudey dancehall . the song might sound like the rest to the untrained ear , but i guarantee that is the song most jamaican will pull up , til it bend is nice ! also check the wicked wicked nothing , who have it ? , the ultra clever better day and the nice hey boy over the petty thief riddim . however , my second favorite song here i would have to say would be the combination don dupes with underrated dancehall singer pinchers who has been making a very very nice return to the scene recently , largely due to his connection with madhouse head , dave kelly . buju makes an attempt ( for some reason ) at the useless wipeout riddim on me unu and actually makes it work a little . also check when things slow down on nice tunes such as driver , which is easily one of the best tunes on the album . overall , the thought alone , buju doing another dancehall album may have some salivating and some wondering where the roots is , this one may appeal to both group of hardcore fans . while there is nothing here that i would call definitive roots reggae , this album has such an old school vibes to it that anyone who has ever been a fan of buju 's will find something they like . i would have like to have seen buju have at least one lenky riddim on the album , a wayne wonder combination ( although pinchers subs just fine ) and definitely the massive song beauty queen from the twice again riddim would have fit just fine here , but nevertheless , what you do have : high quality dancehall from one of the greatest architects of that skill is just fine and too bad , over both what beenie and baby cham have done , is the best pure dancehall album of 2006 to date , and a boomshot in the arm for the genre
music	buy it . now . stop reading . are you still reading ? ? ? ? okay , so i 'll tell you my reason why . reason ( s ) why . 5.1 sound . dts . different ( some versions better to my ears/psyche ) than the cd . flavor . beautiful production . did i mention dts - you got ta hear this in dts . and she and her band deserve and have earned every penny you could spend on her ( gratuitously inciting flaming ) . i am just hoping that she will give us the opportunity to have dvd 's covering her 'girl in the other room ' and her 'from this moment on ' .
music	this cd is great . it is a must have . picture yourself in the wild or on a lake in a boat and a thunderstorm comes rolling in slowly . you hear the rain , the thunder in the distance , you sense the storm getting closer . the storm is over head , loud piercing thunder claps and you duck for cover . the thunderstorm slowly moves out but the rain is a constant presents . the thunder rolls on but the wild life moves in , bullfrogs , owls in the distance , all the animals are alive now . this cd is all in one , the real deal . it is not all thunder . i love it . i also bought thunderstorm [ rykodisc ] ; this was a waste of money . to me , in my opinion it sounds like the storm just knocked the cable out , static and more static .
music	i woke up this morning to the grating sounds of `` good little girls '' blaring over my clock radio 's single , worn-out speaker . a speaker that has helped introduce some great songs over the past year , such as `` there goes my life '' and `` live like you were dying '' . `` good little girls '' is easily the worst country song i 've ever heard - and i thought neal mccoy was bad ! blue country is the c equivalent of wham ! ( a dated reference to be sure ) maybe i 'm just getting too old for country music
music	i first became a fan of the gorillaz with their excellent 2nd cd , demon days . the interesting thing about this band is that their music is so strange and so `` out there '' that when you first hear one of their cd 's ... it sounds like complete garbage . but once you listen again and again , you start to like it more and more . eventually you end up really liking the cd . that was the case with demon days . after enjoying that cd fully , i thought i should check out the first gorillaz cd , and i did n't like it all that much . there just seems to be very little actual songs on the cd . way too much of it sounds like complete filler . there were a couple throwaway songs on demon days , but most of the stuff on that cd was great . here , we 've got songs that are just ... boring . nothing happens . i was waiting for the melody or a cool tune to occur in some of these songs , but it never happens . you just listen to 2-d whining into the microphone with dull beats in the background . ( such as on songs like new genious , man research , and starshine . ) some songs are nothing but beats with no lyrics at all , sometimes sounding just like static noise . songs like this , such as double bass , are cool for a minute or two , but the song drags on for practically 5 minutes . it gets boring . other songs , like 5/4 , m1 a1 , and rock the house are catchy at first , but just do n't have staying power . they get old . 5/4 got annoying quickly , m1 a1 and punk lost their appeal quickly , and rock the house is another song that would have been better if they cut about 2 minutes out of it . and songs like latin simone are just annoying . the remixes of 19-2000 and clint eastwood that end the cd are also fairly forgettable , although 19-2000 's kind of catchy on the first couple listens . there are some good songs here , though . tomorrow comes today , clint eastwood , gravity , 19-2000 , and left hand suzuki method are cool songs . slow country 's kind of cool , too . and dracula 's got an awesome , almost haunting sound to it , and it 's really absorbing . although it too , unfortuantely , loses its tune and turns to repetitive and aimless techno noise about half way through it . this small collection of good songs , though , is surrounded by a huge collection of filler tracks . much of this cd just is n't really that good . i do n't know ... this cd just seemed empty . very few meaningful tracks , lots of filler , and some really annoying and repetitive songs . some good songs were stretched to almost 5-minutes long , mostly given filler techno beats that ruin the songs . clocking in at 72 minutes , ( which makes it 22 minutes ( ! ) longer than demon days ) this cd was loaded with filler and just not enough good stuff . people interested in the gorillaz should pick up their superior follow-up , demon days , instead of this one . if i listened to this debut cd first , i probably would n't have ended up liking this band very much . the good news about this is that the gorillaz have not hit a sophmore slump ; their cds are getting better , not worse . that is a great sign for the future of this awesome band .
music	i 've always been a terri clark fan but this is the first cd i 've purchased by her . i was surprised at how much i really enjoyed this cd ! terri has an amazing voice and the songs kept me listening to the cd over and over again
music	i 'm a fan of three 6 mafia , and i can say maybe they kinda got a little of three 6 's rap style in this album , but i dunno . dj paul and juicy j , the superproducers , they can never be beaten . i got all the hypnotize minds albums and they did invent crunk music . many people have n't heard of them cuz besides ridin ' spinners and chickenhead they have n't been played on the radio very much except for their new track `` poppin ' my collar . '' crime mob 's alright . the beats are alright , but nothing compared to three 6 mafia . some of them are some krunk songs , i can get hyped to a few of them . but other than that i dunno . the lyrics are rather simple , i 'm an 18 year old white dude and i think i can put together some better bars than these dudes can . but they do get some major play up here in virginia . stilletos and knuck if you buck have n't gotten some airtime . but there 's only like 4 songs total that are worth hearing . i guess we 'll see if they put out another album or not . i think if they had some other fellas from georgia like t.i . or jeezy or something they might get some more hype . who knows , since paul wall 's on every song now maybe he 'll make a cameo . i guess we 'll see . three 6 mafia still the buckest and besides their new artist chrome , who really is garbage , they are still the kings of crunk , not lil ' john
music	i do n't own this cd . i do n't have to own it to review it , because this music is the soundtrack of my high school years . i lived this music . i listened to it while cruising the local shopping center indulging in - er - various activities . half of the bands on this cd i had the privilege of seeing perform live in the 70s . this is what fm radio sounded like back then . every single song on this cd was well known to me and my friends . yes , even black oak arkansas ( hot and nasty ! ) , nazareth ( get hair of the dog cd for more ) , and the runaways ( hot babes ! ) . oh , and i love the movie too . party on , dudes
music	i have never been able to see what the big deal was about this band . all of their records , in general , sound exactly the same , and this one is no exception . post-velvets guitar/organ drones , lackadaisical vocals , blankly uninteresting non-lyrics ( they could have recited their grocery lists and it would have been more interesting ) , and a dramatic lack of energy ; all of yo la tengo 's trademarks are fully represented here , and if you can stay awake through it , you 're a better man/woman than i . a surpassingly boring record , even from this usually very boring band . if you 've heard the velvet underground , neu ! , stereolab 's early records , and sonic youth , you 've heard yo la tengo in total . if you 're a big enough fan of those named bands , you could probably write songs that sound like `` painful . '' but you would probably write better ones . avoid this like the plague unless you suffer from insomnia
music	this album is incredible . for me this is one of those few albums that defines a time in my life . an album that for months i played over and over . an album that i 've played countless times , that i have passed out to when i came home after a late night , that i have ran to , and worked out to , that i play at work for a pick-me up . it 's great . it 's filled with so much emotion and passion , from beginning to end its just brilliant , the entire album . the songs are composed more like classical music with sweeping scores that start off slow and steady and then build up and explode into these intense jams . i love it . you have to buy this album . then buy their next self titled album . then play it and play it , and play it . it grows on you . i ca n't wait to see them live ...
music	sweet brazillian jazz piano combined with guaraldi 's 1960 's hit `` cast your fate to the wind . '' throw in a coupla classics like `` since i fell for you '' and `` moon river '' masterfully interpreted by vince and you have the perfect album for unwinding , loving , or waking up
music	when i bought this cd it was for a little bit of nostalgia - those were the days . since playing it once when it blew me away with the tracks and the memories , i have played it so often that if it were vinyl it would be worn out by now . if you liked mary hopkins then this is a fantastic selection of her music and well worth a place in your collection
music	this was one of the first hiphop albums i ever purchased and i still listen to it today i think that krs 's style was best suited to primos production . once he lost primo ( with the exception of a few albums ) he couldnt hold it anymore musicly . krs didnt care about the latest trends in music or about bein a thug or topping the pop charts he just showed his incredible talents on the mic and stomped all the wack mcs that deserved it . this was also the album that introduced the world to krs as a solo artist and he proved that he had plenty of ammunition left from his bdp days as well as few musical/lyrical tricks up his sleeve this album along with any other bdp release should be considerd mandatory listening for all you youngsters out there who are just getting into hiphop this was the era that i belive hiphop was the best about 93-98 its a shame that kris is doing the crap hes doing now i wish he would find a better producer or just stop doing albums and continue his carrer as a live battle rapper .
music	this cd is boring and derivative to the point of being cynical . a better alternative would be to listen to either : a ) the original artists who influenced this band or b ) someone at least trying to do something new with music . to enjoy this cd you 'd have to really want to like this band , either because you liked dig or because you 're attracted to their super-cool reputation . if you 're afraid you 're missing out on something by not owning bjm 's back catalogue do n't worry , you 're not .
music	this album contains only rap and no rock songs . this was very disappointing to say the least
music	dj shadow is in my honest opinion one of the most overlooked artists in music today . threading the thin line between commercial and underground , and finding his niche somewhere in between ( as unkle says , the middle ground between light and shadow ) dj shadow continues to impress with every release he puts forth . i was fortunate enough to pick this album up right after its release , and actually purchased it before i bought endtroducing , which is by far dj shadow 's best album , and one of the best albums ever made . by sampling elements from just about anywhere shadow combines elements from our pop culture to create mini-movies of his songs which few artists can touch in terms of sheer production value , and the emotional effect that is created while listening to his music . i am actually glad i bought this album before endtroducing as it has given me the time to truly appreciate this album for what it is ; a work of art , and a continual growing of shadow 's talents . had i bought endtroducing before this and writtwn a review i 'm sure i would have garnered it with a 4 star review , but that is simply not the case here . while endtroducing is always going to be leaques above and beyond this album , josh davis has found a way here to go above and beyond what should be expected of an album , and given us an album that i 'm sure years from now i will still find elements in it that will grow even more on me with time . best enjoyed while driving or relaxing at home ( possibly with a little mary in tow , if you know what i mean ) , the songs fluctuate with peaks and valleys of highs and lows , and the beats are flawless , especially when compared to a lot of the mainstream garbage that is put out in the record industry on a regular basis . see the thing is that shadow bases his music upon how he feels , and artists that do this correctly achieve an emotional reaction from their music that the true artists of our world truly achieve . radiohead for example has a way of doing this , and it is not surprising then that one of dj shadows favorite artists is radiohead , they both fuse these elements into their music , and achieve monumental status in my opinion . the package design is equally well done as well showing an artists eye for presentation , and a graffiti influenced design to the overall package . if you enjoy this album then i highly recommend any of shadows works : endtroducing , preemptive strike , the private press , and in tune and on time , which is a live set recorded in support of this album . unkle is also a well thought out album which bridges the gap between hip-hop , rock and techno , with guest appearences by mike d of the beastie boys , thom yorke from radiohead , and others from throughout the music industry . if you 've never heard of dj shadow before , then i must say that you are missing out , if you are at all interested in underground music , do yourself a favor and pick up any of shadow 's albums or collaborations , i guarantee you will extremely impressed , as with any good album the songs have a way of growing on you over time . peace out
music	yes , there may be some small issues with the sound quality , but you get used to it , and wilhelm kempff is definitely one of the great pianists of the 20th century , so it is worth it . these are incredible performances that are often justly called definitive . kempff seems to always bring out every theme of every work and magnifies its emotional intensity , whereas other pianists would not have nearly as much attention to detail and neglect many subtle themes . highly recommended
music	hooba ... stank ... stinks and will always stink . i do n't know about the rest of the cd , but listening to the reason is about as pleasant as sticking your hand into a running garbage disposal . i 'm not a perfect perrrrsssonn . egad
music	can this be the same d-12 that packed in witty rhymes in a non-serious demeaner ? well , i guess this really does prove they are only a side-show . eminem has different production , so the group will have different production . eminem went more serious , now the group is more serious . besides that , shady himself ( or what is left of what he use to be ) is basically a no-show . in any track eminem 's in , it 's usually the strongest , and that is the case here ; however , that does n't mean he was great . that means the cd itself is misconfusion , contradiction , and a side-show for eminem 's next cd ( `` encore '' , which was better then this , but not that great overall , as well ) . d-12 is the commercials to the eminem show , everyone 's just waiting to get in between them . that 's the case here
music	this cd has some good songs on it , but the majority of them are less than 2 minutes ! it 's kind of a rip off since the songs are much shorter than i expected . they are mixed together , and sometimes a song is so short that the one before it is still fading out by the time the song after it has started ! if you do n't mind really short songs , buy this , but i would n't recommend it otherwise
music	this cd and the one entitled '' night ranger 's greatest hits are almost identical , but are different in this way : `` best '' contains `` i did it for love '' . `` greatest '' contains , instead , `` rumours in the air '' and `` restless kind '' . the other 10 tracks on each cd are the same . so , which one to buy ? my choice is the one with the extra track . also , in my opinion , both tracks on `` greatest '' are better than the one on `` best '' . in addition , here 's hoping that the band or record label decides to release a true `` greatest hits '' or `` best of '' album that will contain about 15 or 16 songs . or maybe a multi-disc compilation that will include some rare tracks . night ranger fans would surely delight to see something like that
music	i was first introduced to the symphonic power metallers formerly known as rhapsody ( name changed due to copyright issues ) on their 2006 live album live in canada . i have to say that i am just not that impressed or entertained by their latest studio effort . the group tends to rely more or the theatrical elements rather than focusing on their metal music . the vocals tend to be oversung , or drowned out by the chaos in the background . rather than enhancing your metal experience with musical theatrical elements , rhapsody of fire puts you to sleep with them . the group does stay true to their fantasy themes however
music	i agree with everyone else ; the music on this album is completely magical . two masters at work with a great rhythm section , very spontaneous-sounding contrapuntal harmonies , unbounded joy in every tune , and some interesting arrangements . this is also the worst-sounding cd ( or lp , for that matter ) that i have ever heard . it sounds worse than lo-res mp3s played over the web ; i have recordings of 78s that sound better . i can not believe that even laserlight would release this . i have other laserlight cds and none of them sound this bad . if they remastered this and made it sound better , i would buy it again . that 's the only reason for 4 stars rather than 5 . still , it 's worth getting if you can listen past the horrible sound quality
music	completely worthless ! if you liked the film , go buy the dvd because this album has no redeeming qualities . the sound quality is fair at best , even for a live album . almost every track is jammed with totally worthless `commentary ' at the beginning or end of the song . the `commentary ' consists of recordings of about a dozen people having random conversations over the phone and laughing for no reason . it would have been nice if they had put these `commentaries ' on different tracks because the way they have it on this cd you have to wait through about a minute and a half of this crap to get to the song you want to hear . the worst part about the album is the lack of the fugees , which means no `killing me softly ' . sadly , you can tell that most of the artists on this album have n't played a show or practiced in a long time as they are a bit rusty and sound horrible , even for a live recording . some of them sounded almost as bad as fallout boy on snl
music	this movie was a favorite in our household and my daughters always enjoyed the karaoke a the end of the dvd , so we searched for the soundtrack . i actually chose this volume over volume 1 for two reasons ... it contains the favorite from the movie , `` i want to grow old with you '' actually sung by adam sandler and secondly , because volume 1 contains the song that adam sandler sings about his ex-girlfriend , which contains quite a bit of profanity , so i did n't want to get it for my kids . i would have given it five stars , but we find the introduction by billy idol at the start of the last track , `` i want to grow old with you , '' which is dialog from the movie , to be distracting and it gets tiring to have to listen to over and over when you just want to hear the song , which i mentioned was the absolute favorite
music	the opening song `` cups '' by the salt lake city orchestra was one of the first songs i downloaded on my ipod . it is such a great mix ! i just love it ! oh yeah ... and the rest of the cds are n't bad either ... ; - )
music	i like most of ac/dc 's music , but i ca n't stand their latest album stiff upper lip . stiff upper lip is the only ac/dc album where you can play it all the way through , and not even hear one good song . stiff upper lip does n't even come close to being as good as back in black or highway to hell . every song on it just bugs the heck out of me . listening to one song off this album is enough to test my patience ; but enduring all 12 of these musical abominations is enough to drive me crazy ! the overall sound is very similar to their earlier albums like highway to hell or back in black . but ... those cds had variety , they were semi original , and they were actually pretty good . this cd is just completely worthless . i have heard some cra ppy cds in my lifetime , but none of them were more pain to listen to than this . the vocalist sounds about 10 times worse than he did on their earlier albums , the music is chunky , repetitive , dull , and boring , and most of the songs sound the same . stiff upper lip is so bland and dull sounding that it sounds more like the monotonous droning of an electric fan than a rock n roll band . the music is so repetitive and similar sounding that its more like listening to the same annoying song for 60 minutes than 12 separate tracks . this cd is just unbelievaby terrible . it is a disgrace to this band 's legacy , and the band members should be embarrased by it . oh well , i guess they probably only made this album because they needed to fulfill their record contract , so i guess they do n't care about how awful it is anyway . all i can tell you potential buyers is to stay as far away from this piece of garbage as possible . it is a total piece of cr ap and it is not fit to listen to . go buy a good ac/dc cd like let there be rock , high voltage , powerage , highway to hell , or back in black . stiff upper lip suc ks so hard it leaves a big purple bruise . it 's so awful i 'd rather listen to the new nickelback cd than this !
music	i feel that a lot of bands were good in the 90 's . this band was one of them . while yes , they were a bit poppy and sellout-ish on americana and conspiracy , they still had enough bad @ ss in them to put on a rad song . i think they should have just did a `` da hui '' single with `` the noose '' and maybe `` cant get my head around you '' on it . this sucks really bad . it makes the average conspiracy of one look like a bad religion album ! ! if you must hear , download or borrow . please guys . quit or make good music . its pretty pathetic hearing `` hit that '' next to the godawful creed and nickelbland ! ! so we go from a punk-ish hard rock band that is inspired by tsol and the damned and plays punk shows with pennywise to this ... a corporate radio rock album that is loved by teenybopper frat boys and the mtv mindless
music	hey ! never liked ja fool ! he is and will always be over ! where is he ? ? ? ? ? ? ? like i care ! any way ! ! ! ! 50 has sold 16 million+ cd 's and ja fool had the nerve to say 50 do n't sell ! ! ha ! ! ! ! ! ! ja fool ! ! ! greatest hits ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! nuff said ! over ja fool rule ! !
music	this cd provides a fantastic overview of rypdal , who has been recording for ecm for 30+ years now . the tracks range from pieces with an `` electric miles '' sound to an orchestrated track . while very diverse , the tracks work well together and are unified by his unique , atmospheric tone and excellent compositions . the infamous ecm sound quality is even better due to 24 bit mastering . informative liner notes as well . highly recommended
music	in general i 'm a big fan of movie music , but to tell the truth i expected more from this one . this soundtrack is incomaparable to say lord of the rings or star wars movie music . it lacks depth and emotion and power . unlike emotionally potent melodies present in lotr soundtrack the eragon is pretty dull and uninteresting . i get the impression that the entire album is in fact a variation of a single theme called eragon . i get the feeling that entire album has only one very long and boring track . i hope they 'll make better album for the next movie of the inheritence trilogy .
music	it 's not great music to dance to
music	it is ludicrous to even mention the fact that the duprees have lasted so long and can still be seen in atlantic city considering the fact that there is not one original member of the duprees in the group that is seen in atlantic city . this is a major problem with many groups purporting to be from the 50 's and 60 's . the duprees appearing today is a perfect example of caveat emptor ... buyer beware for those readers who do n't read latin ! for those of us who were duprees fans , this is a not to be missed cd of the original duprees with the incomparable sound of joey vann and harmony that is hard to match . they did joni james proud in their remake of a number of her hits . it is nostalgia personified hearing the original duprees
music	if you 're a dion fan do n't miss this cd . all the hits including my favourite - donna the prima donna
music	i have all 5 volumes and this is the only one i do n't like . the selection of music is just plain bad . there are a few songs that are ok but most are just dull , dull , dull . i recommend going with one of the first 4 volumes instead
music	i rarely write reviews of music but feel that i must share my impressions of this cd . i have long heard some of my favorite singers praise the songwriting prowess of townes but somehow never got around to buying one of his records . i finally picked this one up because it had two songs that were covered by two of my favorite singers -- lyle lovett- '' lungs '' ( among others ) and steve earle- '' tecumseh valley '' . i was blown away by the sheer beauty and poetry of every song on this recording . other reviewers seem to be comparing this to other townes ' records . i come from a different angle . as someone who has long heard townes sopken of with the highest praise , i can say this disk does not disappoint and will influence me to fill out my collection of his recordings . i will also say that i am deeply frustrated that i never took advantage of the chance to see townes perform while he was alive .
music	i recently discovered joyce cooling . yeah , i 've been in the dark ages . she is one of the smoothest guitarists out there and she does not try to sound like everyone else . i especially appreciate her percussive use of intonations . she 's got chops galore and is a beautiful woman to boot . you can hear it all in her music . buy revolving door ! you 'll love it
music	i really like this cd a lot and i am looking forward to seeing them live
music	i would love to own this soundtrack but why anyone would pay 120 bucks is just plain dumb . quite frankly i would like to see your copyright on this item to see if you are just reburning these cd 's and reselling them . for 120 bucks you should be reported to the authorite
music	this is by far one of the most beautiful recordings made by the bill evans trio . this was i 'm told bill 's first all ballads record . riverside records released it on vinyl way back in 1962 . none of the music sounds dated . considering it 's 41 years old . this is the first recording bill made with chuck israels taking over for the late scott lafaro as the bass player . this album has a very haunting and romantic feeling to it . the music is sad in tone and suggests feelings of longing and sobering reflection . one goal that bill always strived for was to ballance intellect with passion to make intelligent and original sounding jazz . i dont even know if jazz is the right stamp to put on this recording . to me it sounds more like european classical music . also thank god for bill 's college music theory teacher at southeastern university gretchen magee . because if it werent for her motivation { evans often thought of his work as unsatisfactory and sometimes needed alot of motivation from from bandmates and peers } he might not have composed his gorgeous original composition `` very early '' { which is the last track on the cd its just breathtaking ... } being an amature pianist myself , `` very early '' and `` childrens play song '' were the first two evans ' compositions i taught myself to play . the piece is a composition played in c major at a slow waltz tempo . he played the tune until the end of his life in 1980 , but the original version on `` moonbeams '' might be the all around finest one . it is given a very slow and delicate treatment , and when he restates the theme at the end you can almost feel an imagrey of leaves or snow falling gently around you . i also really like his interpretation of `` it might as well be spring '' . i think that bill evans was a beautiful person and pianist because he was never flashy and this album proves that . he didnt play anything he didnt have to . he always played just the right amount of notes and chords . with this record it all comes together coherently to make a truly stunning musical statement . evans once told tony bennet to forget everything else and just concentrate on `` truth and beauty . '' with the album `` moonbeams '' fans of evans ' music and important legacy will clearly be able to hear his own truth and beauty about life glowing from this gorgeous album . highly recommended
music	umm ... i do n't think you quite got the point of this album . it is not about the artists that you like , it is about the artists that inspired moore . your ignorance forces me to do nothing but laugh . i find it funny that you feel you are making a point by saying `` f*ck you soad '' and so on . have some respect for other 's opinions . unfortunately , you are a steriotypical `` ignorant american '' .so with all that said , and with all due respect , i say , f*ck you pal
music	( it ? ) i have many of david and japan 's albums , but this thinly composed album is repetitive , boring and annoying . i think there were some hidden tracks too , but i just wanted the album to be over . you are better off with `` dead bees on a cake '' , `` secrets of the beehive '' or any bee related titled album of his
music	i agree with all the other reviewers .. nice quality recording for its time considering it was in the vaults for decades ..great playing from all concerned ( except the cursed drummer ) , i can not imagine what poor jerry gemmot went through with that drummer .. he should have been dismissed immediately ..or shot ..it would have sounded better without him .. gawd ' awful .. spoils the whole dang thing .. any way .. i can not listen to this anymore without getting uncomfortable , so it 's back to soul of a man , re-kooperation , live adventures , super session , and kooper sessions with shuggie
music	a lame group of angry teenagers screaming about themselves . ironic lyrics like `` image of the invisible '' do not make them intellectual . this trash is not music . get it off my radio ! if only i could give 0 stars..
music	when this album first came out , i felt jilted . but i recently had an oppertunity to listen to it for what it is and i think its a great album . make no mistake , if you 're a die-hard 80 's rocker , you 'll hate this album . the production is raw , and the songwriting is lean and mean as opposed to elaberate and detailed . but that does n't mean that the musicianship is lacking on this record . if you can keep an open mind , i think this ablum is one that you 'll love
music	did not care for the selections on this cd
music	boo-wop ? haha ok , anyways i bought his through middle-piller distro . and it 's got a couple of o.k . songs on it . the problem is the singing and the overall production . this is definetely a home-recording on computer deal . the vocals are waaaaay weak . what exactly is a `` re-worked '' debut album ? ? ? i thought once an album was out it was done , set in stone ? apparently not , so mister monster gets to pull a blitzkid ( who changed their first album cover years after it came out ! ) and take the cheezy way out . a definete step up from bands like blitzkid , but still in the cellar of rock n roll . do yourself a favor and buy some good old deathrock from the golden years
music	i bought this cd since my sister had stolen my original copy , lol . need i say more
music	the fisrt cd is alot better than this one , but this one is still okay . i only liked one song on this disc and it is . track 4 . will the circle be unbroken/i 'll fly away/ jesus loves me . do n't get me wrong the music is beautiful , but i think the first one is alot better
music	i had this album for many years when i was younger . i had looked for along time to try and find it on cd with no luck . i finally found it on amazon . this is my favorite christmas album , i even have my teenage daughter hooked on it now . the caroling medely is awesome and my daugher loves the pinecones and hollyberries song . no one should be without this cd in their christmas collection .
music	i just saw this woman live and she 's amazing ! ! ! ! the songs come alive when you hear them ! it 's hard to put into words the state that her music and lyrics put you in . but trust me it 's a good place ! please check her music out if you 're into heartfelt music
music	i purchased this cd during the lowest time of my life emotionally . every track brought solace and comfort beyond belief , especially the title track , deep peace . i would listen to it over and over , bathing in the lush healing sounds . each element , from the perfectly balanced vocals to the simple piano and violin motifs , is seemingly structured at a spiritual level . this is more than ambient music , it 's true music therapy .
music	britain , circa 1997 . tony blair is elected p.m. princess di perishes . and the spice girls are unleashed to an unsuspecting public . this effort is an attempt to cash in on the phenomenon before a fickle populace turns their attention to the next best thing . to be fair , the girls are not to blame for what a tedious flick this is . rather , they are appealing and prove to be the film 's lone redeeming factor . the fault lies in the script that tries to do for the spice girls what `` a hard days ' night '' did for the beatles . whereas the fab four 's film was full of wit and cogent commentary on beatlemania this flick is unfunny and basically incoherent about what it 's trying to say about the spice craze . i was reminded more of the monkees ' `` head '' than i was of `` a hard days ' night '' . lots of celeb cameos ( roger moore , elton john , et al ) that amount to naught . oh , well . on to `` from justin to kelly ''
music	i saw this band open for placebo in tampa , fl . i had never heard of them before that night . i bought the cd immediately . though it 's a bit plain , it 's a great cd . it 's a comforting kind of plain it rocks . i played it in my cd player for about a month straight . the lead singers voice is unique . this band definitely has much potential to become a well known group . a great debut album . if you ever get to see them live do it ! their live show definitely makes the cd come alive .
music	for someone who knows little about bach and wants to learn something , you could n't do better than to give them this cd . ormandy and the philadelphia orchestra give their signature warm , plush sound to the work of the great johann sebastian bach , making him sound very nearly like a romantic rather than a baroque or classical composer . this is not a bad thing -- some complain that bach , with his mathematical leanings , leaves them cold . that is n't possible with the inviting material on this cd
music	... when you 're gearing up for suicide . this whole album sounds like the last thoughts and comments of a person who 's going to just end it all . i found myself suffering nightmares , fatigue , misery and paranoia . my ears unclogged but i started getting headaches and a fuzzy feel in my head . this is not a good album for the stressed , because it will just make you feel worse . i find this album unlikable and mostly unenjoyable . when i first listened to it it sounded inaccessable , after listening to it more and more i started to get more `` into '' it , but i ca n't say i found it a good place to be in . it 's a somewhat interesting album , but it mostly just dragged me down , made me nervous , numb and hurt my head . people say this is great music . let them say what they want . give me some old fashioned enjoyable music that does n't make a pest of itself . kid a is just ok to me , and has n't been worth all the effort to `` get into '' . this almost seems like a sadomasochistic album to spank the listeners . i do n't know , maybe i 'm missing something , but to hear some `` weird '' music like this that has miles more heart and is alot kinder to the ears , try `` passengers '' by u2 . and thom york sings like a muppet on this album . by the way i 've enjoyed radiohead 's first three albums quite a bit ( including pablo honey -- why are people always busting its chops ) .
music	have loved this album since it first came out years ago ( bought on vinyl - lost to the mists of time ) . the cd was out of print but i kept looking and found it on amazon ( it was re-released ) , yeah ! ! ! ! last steam engine , from the cradle to the grave , louise , owls , you do n't have to need me - some of my favorites . this , to me , is kottke in his prime
music	after reading her excellent halloween book , i figured her halloween cd would be worth owning . i always search for `` different '' halloween cds , but this was filled with the same old stuff . chains , moans , and spooky laughs ... then more chains , moans and spooky laughs . very dissapointing
music	this album is very weak compared to his earlier efforts . the music is simple and straightforward , and the rapping is poor
music	this is quite a sharp turn from francine 's previous album ( 40 on a fall day ) ... whereas the last album was closer sonically to frontman clayton scoble 's work in poundcake , this time around it 's quieter , subtler , sweeter and sadder . make no mistake , this is a break-up album . even those songs that make no mention of breaking up leave you with that cold , lonely , hug-craving feeling only the best break-up albums can . the mood will draw you in and keep you listening , but after a few listens it 's the songs you 'll fall in love with . ahh , the songs . they 're densely packed with chord changes , odd but appealing lyrics , and unexpected instrumentation . they 're hooky without being obvious ( a francine specialty ) . this was my favourite album of 2003 , and i still listen to it pretty often these days . best tracks : this sunday 's revival , silver plated 606 , novelty , 13 years . best lyric : `` read a year old mail / now you should 've told me / i 've been repeating myself / only far less convincingly
music	this soundtrack cd is the perfect compliment to the visionary film -- cater burwells score is a pitch-perfect aural equivocation of the profound sadness and blithe absurdity on display , with his sense of minimalist suggestiveness and rich textural instincts shining bightly.also an added bonus of the above-mentioned dream combination -- bartok 's `` allegro '' ( i know diddly about classical music , but bartok rocks ! ! ) , and a typically great bjork song '' amphibian '' ( in two versions ) , that book-ends the album with an etherial , dream-like haze
music	why are they butchering pac 's songs like this . i advise anyone to get the bootlegs over this album . the original ghetto gospel and loyal to the game are 2 of my favorite pac songs but the one 's on here are painful to listen to . afeni should have let dj quik , daz , and whoever else that worked with pac do this album . they should have just digitally remastered the bootlegs . this started with still i rise to until the end of time to better dayz and the quality has been going down and down and they hit rock bottom with this one . the 2 stars is 1 because it is pac and another for the song uppercut . the most obvious butcher job is black cotton where em chose a fast beat and you could tell he is trying to speed up pac 's rhyme . i hope they do better with this last album due out this year
music	this is the jacksons second album for epic and producers gamble and huff . it would be their last with gamble and huff but together they made a great album that doesnt get the play it should . music 's takin over , different kind of lady and do what you wan na are great , catchy dance tracks . the real greatness here lies in the ballads where michael 's voice is in peak form . even though you 're gone and find me a girl are classic ballads . so good , i feel that find me a girl is probably the best michael jackson song you 've never heard . this is probably michael jackson 's most overlooked album and its one of his best ! the jacksons all sing together great and you can see why destiny and triumph were such big hits after this one was recorded . overall , great ballads , catchy feel good dance tracks , and michael jackson singing his heart out . get this , you will not be dissaponted
music	i purchased this cd after reading one of the reviews . i have another streetwize cd that i love , but i was a litter weary about getting this one ( jazz meets dre and all ) . but i am glad i made the purchase , as i am thoroughly enjoying it
music	i remember hearing of this band when i was just a lad , but i never owned any of their albums , and none of my closest friends played this for me , so this is a great discovery for me . i 'm only on my second listen , but it 's already obvious to me that this is going to become a favorite . it 's from my favorite rock period , the early seventies , and it 's not only nicely remastered , it 's also remixed , meaning they went back to the original multi-tracks , not the stereo master . i wish more reissues were done this way
music	i like this album . its got a nice mix of old and new material . along with some live material . great to see pe still at it in this ever changing rap game
music	the title gets it right - this is a very fun album . there are a lot of great songs on here . infectious lyrics and music - it still surprises me that matthew sweet is n't more popular than he is . one other thing ... it 's a sin that `` we 're the same '' was n't a bigger hit than it was . truly a great song
music	i originally purchased this cd at a local store . so many of my friends and family loved it that i ordered 4 more from amazon at a fraction of the cost . it is a superb cd and i recommend it to all .
music	this was the first punk-o-rama cd i listened to , and boy i was not dissapointed . most of the songs on this cd are the type of punk i would listen to , quite fast and energetic . the best song on the cd has to be either nofx - bath of least resistance ( nofx being the greatest punk band of all time , of course ) , or beatsteaks - let me in . i heard the beatsteaks for the first time on this cd and there absolutely bloody excellent . obviously , the cd is made complete with songs from the descendents , pulley , pennywise , dropkick murphy 's . the only let down on this cd is noise conspiracy , there song on this cd , well plainly sucks i 'm sorry to say . but overall this cd is one hell of a good listen if your into punk . that 's all , oh yeah , buy it ! by
music	not as epically gorgeous as 'once upon a time in america ' , but still lovely . there 's a south american influence that lends a very fresh sound to the entire soundtrack . my favourite track is an ave maria -- in guarani . haunting . however , `` gabriel 's oboe '' is the theme that makes this score . being an oboist , it of course holds a particular appeal to me -- and the oboe performing the theme is really something to be aspired to
music	coltranes recordings with his classic quartet of '61-5 varied between very good and stunning . coltrane fans may want to get the impulse ! box set instead though ( which includes this cd and the other works of the quartet
music	great fan of the man they call 'sugar ' zucchero , but this outing is really below par . this cd consists of rerecordings of older songs , with the addition of other famous singers . did he send the original recordings to these people , en did they ad little pieces here and there ? it sounds like it ! none of the songs have gotten ' better compared to the originals . to me this cd is a total rip off intended to make easy money ( and get more attention for 'sugar ' outside of italy ? ) . do n't buy it , get 'oro ' , 'shake ' or 'blue sugar ' instead
music	this is truly one of the great jazz albums of all time . surprisingly , evans ' introspective style and cannonball 's soulful approach meld together perfectly . perhaps this is testament to just how hugely talented these men are . both the technical skill and pure musicmanship displayed on this record is just amazing . i 've owned this cd for over 10 years now and still find so much to listen to in these recordings . highlights are the amazing `` waltz for debby '' and earl zindars ' waltz `` elsa '' , easily one of the most beautiful songs ever written , in my opinion . you simply can not go wrong with this cd
music	i did n't think it was possible for the delays to top their debut release - but they have . while `` faded seaside glamour '' is more immediately catchy and refined , `` you see colours '' comes at you in a much more intense manner . the songs are more mature , the musicianship is top-notch and the recording sparkles with fat bottom-end and soaring harmonies . the high points for me are valentine and winters memory of summer , but there 's honestly not a bad track on this release . the delays put it all together - great songwriting , strong musicianship and excellent production in a genre-bending mix that has something for everybody . it 's a shame these guys do n't get more recognition here in the states . buy it
music	the title track is one of the best country songs ever performed proving the talents of hank as a true caftsman when it comes to song writing . fitting that category as well are outlaw women , and women i 've never had . hank also lends his southern rockin ' style to white lightnin ' written by j.p. richardson a.k.a . the big bopper . what bocephus album would be complete without at least one tribute to his father ? hank serves up a whopper here along with waylon jennings in a classic called the conversation . in a time , much like today , when country was straying from it 's roots hank finds a way to keep the southern bluesy traditions alive on all ten cuts of this must have country album
music	being a fan of jack johnson , i thought this one would be as good as the others . i was n't impressed at all . it sounds like a few guys pickin ' around in the basement . the recording quality has very little production value . at best , these are okay live versions of usually great songs . this is an unnecessary piece for your jack johnson collection .
music	very essential music.the arrangements & amp ; styles work very well.he has great depth & amp ; feel here.it 's classic ellington.he was always constantly changing music
music	first show on broadway i ever left at intermission . i bought the tickets because i did n't think i could go wrong seeing a show directed by strohman , starring craig bierko who was fantastic in music man and was flat flat flat in this show , and music by harry connick jr. whom i have loved forever . it taught me that everything has it 's place and harry 's place is not a broadway stage . i hope for his sake , he does not try again . if i could rate something at zero stars , this would get that rating
music	i have a few hundred surf cds and i would have to say thet this cd is my favorite ! my next favorite is their new cd called `` headin ' out '' . they have the reverb and the composition that just makes all of the songs fantastic . if you like instrumental surf you will love this cd ! buy it you wo n't be sorry
music	great cd . imus in the morning recommended highly and the i-man was not wrong . one of the best cd 's i 've owned in years . i listen to a lot of buffett , james taylor , delbert mcclinton , and this cd places high in these ranks
music	zoolook~ jean-michel jarre is a case where the artist is way to avant-garde for his own best . after having made amazing albums such as oxygene , equinox and magnetic fields he unfortunately creates this mess of an album . i find it a bit too much like modern art , i.e. , confusing , confounding and impossible to grasp . it also seems like jarre was a bit over confident when he recorded this album . he had recorded some of the best synth albums of all time and decided to create a total arts album and it just does not work . this is an album that should have stayed unrealesed since it is just to avant-garde and sounds more like an experimental sound session rather then as a well produced album . very disapointing indeed !
music	i should first state that i am a huge ej fan . his music has been extremely important to me over the years . he is , without a doubt , a genius ... i would go so far as to call him the mozart of our times . but , elton can also write bloated , self-indulgent tripe , and if you ask me , this album belongs in that bucket . i give it 2 stars just because of ssmlt , one of his all-time greats . i never cease to be blown away by that song . but the rest of this album ? booooooring ! ! !
music	this movie was only good because of two reasons . rammstein , and queens of the stone age . other than that , completel out of control p.o.s . that keeps its viewers contemplating whether they have died and this movie is their eternal punishment in hell
music	low tech and brilliant , music that seems to have channeled zappa , winchester cathedral , and god knows what else . incredibly funny , and then suddenly sad . mr pink is a genius , you betcha . and he explains what it is and how it is to live here in this strange quasi-city in the shadow of the industry , in the curiously full and fun wasteland of other people 's dreams
music	this ancient jazz classic never sounded better.rudy van gelder did an excellent job remastering this one with the 24- bit.he proves that it does matter who takes up the task of remastering this wonderful jazz classic . just keep them coming rudy
music	a lot of music fans have mused over why matthew sweet did not achieve greater success with the masses despite his obvious ability to write very catchy songs . `` sick of myself '' single-handedly rejuvenated my faith in the power of pop music at a time when pop seemed to have exhausted its possibilities . but in retrospect sweet simply was n't a very marketable commodity for the music industry , and on top of that his vocals and lyrics somehow did n't grab people . its not that he does n't sing with passion or feeling , but somehow the words seem to get lost in the mix . perhaps its a production thing ; regardless , the vocals on a ms album always seem to be secondary to the music and that is a no-no for any great singer-songwriter . there are some truly impressive ( albeit derivative ) stuff here : `` what matters '' is in my opinion the greatest byrds song never written , `` hide '' is a beautiful piano ballad that would n't seem out of place on badfinger compilation , `` if time permits '' has some of the most beautiful chorus harmonies not written by brian wilson , etc . etc . `` i 've been waiting '' works well in combining catchy melody with plaintive adolescent desire , and `` girlfriend '' is for the most part a great rocker . however , after the relatively simple production of girlfriend , his later albums got bogged down in an attempt to recreate a `` wall of sound '' feeling , which quite frankly does n't really work unless you 're phil spector . not much here can be completely discounted and the new songs fit in quite well ( although i probably would have included `` evangeline '' at the expense of `` ready '' ) . despite the undeniable quality of the music there is nothing life-changing here and ultimately great music must at least have the semblance of being life-changing . still heartily recommended for fans of catchy , melodic pop-rock
music	ashlee 's recent face lift and apparent nose job is proof that 's she 's all plastic and no talent . she must of asked the dr to make her look like her sister . very sad cause she 's unrecognizable now . better looking , maybe , still ca n't sing or dance .
music	dave alvin 's sublime new cd is a cadre of songs written by californians either born and/or who grew up in this land . the lyrics talk about what it means to live and love in the land of dreams and broken promises . it is also a look at the story of the frontier in this large western state . dave alvin has a voice that is deep and smooth and like a friend of his said `` infiltrates your brain like a shot of jack daniels . '' dave alvin says `` we started with a list of 25 songs , from steve gillette to captain beefheart and everything in between . i was even thinking of doing 'going back to cali ' as a blues thing . in the end , though , it was n't about choosing my favorite songs so much as choosing songs that i could sing well enough and arrange differently enough to make them interesting . '' he has picked these songs carefully and each of them fit his style and voice well . of them all , and i like each and every one , my two favorite interpretations are `` here in california '' and `` surfer girl '' `` california bloodlines '' is a sentimental rendition of john stewart 's fine work , which finds peace in knowing `` there 's california bloodlines in my heart / there 's a california woman in my song ... and a california heartbeat in my soul . '' `` redneck friend '' the jackson brown less well known song was just right for dave alvin 's style . `` kern river '' is a song merle haggard wrote after losing his best friend , and it is a melancholy rendition . `` blind love '' from tom waits is sung in a bluesy style with some doo wops thrown in to give it style . `` here in california '' one of my favorites is sung with christy mcwilson . he felt this song needed a woman 's perspective . `` i 'm bewildered '' is an old richard berry , the great guitarist 's tune . backed up by the calvenes . `` sonora 's death row '' written by blackie ferrell is a fable that examines the price of acting out of greed and anger and ends up a as gun fighter 's tale . `` down on the riverbed '' is an old los lobos song that is sung in dave alvin 's old blues style . `` between the cracks '' a song written by dave alvin and tom russell is a heartbreaking tale of young boy told by a loving woman , with a rollicking tune . this is the only dave alvin orignal song in this cd . `` do n't look now '' a song sung by john fogerty is an old creedence clearwater revival . bluesy and fun to make it dave 's . `` tramps and hawkers '' by jim ringer is a delicate country waltz , come dance with me , bk . lyrics are wonderful . `` loser '' by jerry garcia and robert hunter , is darker with more infused blues than garcia 's version . it could n't sound less like a deadhead song . dave alvin put in a psychedelic section that is a tribute to the san francisco sound `` surfer girl '' brian wilson 's first song is done with doo-wops and again the calvanes did background . this is my favorite of dave alvin 's interpretations , and he sings this surfin'song with some tongue in cheek . dave alvin gives voices of california to this cd . voices from the california coastline and the surf music it inspired to the `` brown earth of the state '' to the frontier life and the lives won and lost . dave alvin had made his mark on this state , and the writers who loved their lives by writing and singing about the state they love . play it often and pay attention to the subtle influence of this cd . `` california dreamin ' ? '' highly recommended . prisrob 6-04-06
music	no use thumbing the pages of cale 's elegant scrapbook of an autobiography , 'what 's welsh for zen ? , to glean hard data on this one melodic gem . coming after the heady , if problematic days of the velvets , there 's barely an acknowledgement of it as he strides into his rock format . the abrasive thrashing rock of 'mcbeth ' ( while indicating his imminent direction ) serves the one discordant note . throughout , cale namedrops to effect learnedness without destroying the mood of a distant past . language had been severed from lineal meaning , in rock , since bob went electric . pete brown writing for jack bruce 's towering masterpieces , 'songs for a sailor ' , 'harmony row ' ; keith reid with procul harum , were mixing up the lyric medicine , presumably with other pharmacuticals making sumptuous music on a par with 'paris 1919 ' . that date ? the birth of surrealism , ( and similar writing to cale 's efforts herein ) perhaps ? the russian revolution ? cale 's singing on 1919 had a world weary distance to it , which suited the reflective jabberwocky of the songs ; stretched out vowells on , 'planing lakes ' , 'elephants that sing ' , 'looking out from here at half past france . ' it was far from banal music , however saccharine the orchestral moves from strings , viola piano cale painted . these lyrics were baffling but made perfect poetic sense when sung . 'locusts ' was something of a revisiting to this pastoral mood but lacks the roundedness . 'fragments of a rainy season ' is a good retrospective concert . and some of the fuge written around the hommage to andy warhol is very moving stuff . go john
music	i was a big fan of this band 's song `` rock'n'roll highschool '' , and i recently saw the documentary about them , so , when i saw this anthology selling for around $ 15 in australia , i thought i 'd take a punt by buying it . my thoughts on this album are similar to the ones i had for the 3 cd johnny o'keefe collection [ reviewed at this site by me ] . namely , overall , the album is very listenable , with some standout tracks . as with the jok album , this album is/was great value for money , considering how many songs you get for the price . of the songs i particularly like on this album , and the ones i have been listening to quite a bit , are : rock'n'roll high school . this song still rocks after all these years . do you remember rock'n'roll radio ? good song , though it never got the airplay that the previous song seemed to get here in australia . chinese rock . an easter egg song ! ! never heard this song before , but it is an instant classic . very catchy . danny says . another easter egg song . takes some repeated listening to get into , but once you do that , it gets high rotation on your cd player . to me , i can see why the ramones are considered founders of punk . at least as far as the music is concerned . however , the sex pistols truly define punk for me . they have the whole package which i identify with punk ... namely , the punk sound , and the incendiary , anarchistic lyrics . the ramones are more middle-class sounding , to my ears at least . i 'm surprised at how poppy/boppy the ramones are . to me they sound like a punk motown band . one of the songs on the 2nd cd , i think , has that classic punk sound , but i did n't make a note of the title . might have to edit that song in later ... could be `` endless vacation '' ? lastly , the song danny says , almost comes across as a punk beach boys song . overall , the anthology is often 'samey ' , but listenable nonetheless , with a handful of songs that i consider 'high rotation ' worthy . just remembered , `` endless vacation '' seems a terrific song too . will have to listen to that some more-i 've currently got the 1st cd in my cd player . p.s . listened to this song last night . really good-the fast talking bit in the song reminds me of the equally good , if not better song by australian act tism [ or this is serious mum ] - '' [ he 'll never be an ] ol ' man river '' , about river phoenix , amongst other people . tism , like the ramones , can do bad taste well .
music	afi used to be a pretty good band . then , they decided to go emo-girlie-boy . the lead singer has made adramatic change from smelly-goth-dude to perfect-manicured-emo-girl/guy . what happened to smeely-goth-dude ? some of us actually like the music , not the `` emoness '' . not only that , but `` miss murder '' was waaaaay overplayed , and now it is encrested into my brain . i mean , come on , it 's not even that good of a song . afi is looking to appeal to the mainstream . there 's nothing wrong with that , if you keep your old sound , which this band has failed to do . this , my friends , is afi 's worst album , if not hte worst album of 2006 . check out the older afi stuff . `` sing the sorrow '' is okay , but if you want truley good music , you have to go back into their ninties albums
music	i saw the movie and liked the songs in it . i ordered the soundtrack from the movie , but it was not the soundtrack . they have a dubbed another person in on ike 's part . all the songs from the movie were not on the soundtrack and some other of tina 's were included . i feel that if it is going to be advertised as a soundtrack then it should be a true soundtrack . i was disappointed .
music	this cd is a must for any horn player or lover of the instrument ! cerminaro has tremendous technique and extremely sensitive mucicality . en
music	i got the cd with only disc 2 ... it was unopened and had 2 copies of disc two it was rediculus ... im happy onme of my friends could make me a copy of the first one ...
music	i 've always liked tevin campbell , he had a beautiful voice and really did it on `` break it down '' . i particularly like break it down , shhh , brown eyed girl among others.. excellent cd overall .
music	the first cd from baby anne is fairly typical florida breaks fare . i would n't claim that 's a bad thing , but do n't expect to be surprised if you 're familiar with the genre . overall it 's a solid offering from baby anne and delivers the bass . the second cd is a surprising mix from jen lasher , who has abandoned her old breakbeat sound and fully adopted a more electro feel . to those who have labeled this `` industrial '' i will say first and foremost that you are wrong . there is not one remotely industrial track on the cd . what she does provide is an extremely varied mix of synthpop , house , and a couple breaks tracks , all very vocal and sporting an electro pop flare , sometimes approaching the full-on ny electroclash sound . from someone quite familiar with electropop artists i ca n't recommend highly enough this diverse mix guaranteed to please newcomers and electro afficianados alike . my only complaint is the strikingly misplaced wolfsheim track , which i can only assume fueled the misguided and completely false depeche mode comparison from another reviewer .
music	chicane should just stop releasing material under that guise ever again . fftmc and bts were lush and beautiful productions . nicks latest attempts have been pathetic ... from a musical standpoint and from a professional production standpoint ... even his older 'pop ' remixes for other artists were better than this rubbish he 's doing these days ... no , we 're not saying recycle the older productions , but instead it 's a matter of putting the effort and 'originality ' in the profuctions ... a signature if you will ... and hey , it does n't have to pigeon hole you if done with class ... yes , how the mighty have fallen ... oh brother..
music	without getting too much into it this album is pretty good . 4 stars for some bad ass tracks . my favs are tears from the moon , beautiful things , as the rush comes . all in all worth the money
music	oh my goodness rodger , oh my goodness . just oh my gosh , i 'm just stunned . this is the crappiest pice of crap that was ever ingested and mushed into chyme . yeah , you heard me , this is chyme . ok , let 's see , let 's mix bland country ballads with all kinds of awkward pop/country crossovers ... . what do we get , half-baked , half-digested stuff that is for dumb teenage girls who are massively overweight . well , they 're probably smarter than me ... ... ... .. i 'm like as smart as a fungi . no one needs to know and whose bed have your boots been under are on the right direction out of the smelly stool sample . before i get too many people wanting to massively torture me with horrible utensils i 'll say something nice . come on over was an excellent effort , with all kinds of hooks , great production ( errr , i mean it is robert `` i 'm actually dead '' lang ) , and all kinds of fun . up ! was even better ( i 'm not going to praise it too much , though , i mean , i am an 18 year old guy ... ... so i already feel like i should be staring at a picture of kevin sorbo or something ... which is not cool , i mean unless it 's just hero worship , i could worship kevin sorbo ) ! but still , we have this horrible , stinking , steaming mass of smelly wet clay-like pudding to shovel into the toilet ( it 's intended target ) ... ... looks like someone has bad aim
music	there is not enough space for me to explain why this film ( and soundtrack ) are woefully inadequate of the name dr. seuss . the fact that there are so many songs on the album screams commercialism ( what the book was complaining about , wake up people ! ) and james horner 's score which has a couple of nice moments but does n't have that seussian sound . 'where are you christmas ' is annoying beyond all reason and i mean both versions . and whose bright idea was it to have jim carrey mangle 'you 're a mean one ' ? if you 're looking for a more grinch like score , go find elfman 's nightmare before christmas
music	this cd is truly a classic and one of my all-time favorites . love it
music	does anyone know whether this set will become available on sacd or dvd audio format ? how would you contact grp records to ask ? i only give it four stars until multichannel format appears .
music	i listened to this cd and unless you are into the whole barking dog sound of a band i did n't like this one , one bit , but than again it was also for my husband . i definitely would not recommend unless you have heard of the band and like that style of music
music	with a compelling story , great music , great lyrics , and two outstanding female leads , aida certainly delievers . right from the start with the goregous `` every story is a love story '' , the listener is captured by the wonderful spirit of the show . the seamless tranisition between ballads and showtunes is flawless . the three stars of the show each being something different to this recording . while adam pascal is always great , he 's the weak point on this recording . i much more prefer him in rent , and i do n't think his voice suits this show very well . sherie renee scott is teriffic as amneris , and her powerful voice fills this recording with the powerful opener and `` i know the truth '' . the star , however , is heather headley as aida . her tony-winning performance will be forever immortalized on this recording with big , raw , emotional , and powerful voice . she 's is perfect in every way
music	i like these guys alot.i own a bunch of there stuff and love to see them live . i played this cd a few times liked it at first , but it did n't grow on me at all liked i 'd hoped.to cute for me , not spontaneous enough.i feel this cd will be just another dust collector in a short period of time.just let it rip guys , that 's what you do best.thank god my brother bought this instead of me.i bought live at cow palace ( the dead ) great cd
music	this is a great album . two of their biggest hits , `` another one bites the dust , '' and `` crazy little thing called love , '' are here . my favorites are `` need your loving tonight , `` and `` prime jive . '' most of the other songs are top notch , too . none of the later queen albums matched this one . definitely in the class of night at the opera , day at the races and news of the world
music	it 's sad that people can get a record deal for beinga good kareoke singer . yeah , maybe my fish can get a record deal : they `` sing '' in tone , can breath , but refue to lip-synch ( i know it sounds gay ) . this is just sad because bands that play their own instruments , write their own songs , and perform their own songs can pretty much get almost no attention . let 's take the band king 's x : doug pinnick ( vocals/bass ) is an amazing metal singer who can sing in perfect pitch and writes good lyrics about god ( king 's x is a christian band ) ; ty tabor ( guitar/vocals ) has some of the bestguitar solos you probably do n't know ; and jerry gaskill ( drums/vocals ) has some pretty complicated rhythm patterns ... yet only like a few dozen people ( i know a lot more people than that like kx ; i 'm just exagerating ) seem to like this band . it 's sad . if you want good music , listen to the band i just menioned ( king 's x if you were n't paying attention ) . ( if amazon does n't post this i will seriously get poed !
music	i 'm going to the trouble of writing this review to warn you : this cd is not like the other putumayo cds . no , it is not fun , hip , relaxing , good to dance to , or stimulating . it is a selection of hackneyed sinatra-style slop sung by a variety of leery-sounding men with fake deep voices . i have this rule for music : if it makes me think of animated dogs kissing over pasta , it sucks . consider yourself warned . if you like good music , try french cafe instead
music	i was thrilled to see this available on cd ... ... ... . it is the most delightful christmas 'album ' of it 's time it continues to delight ! i purchased several and gave to friends for christmas - every single receipient was immediately thrilled to have this 'album ' on cd stating , 'this was my favorite , where 'd you find it ? '' great gift
music	my husband and i play this cd all the time . we both love it
music	do not buy this cd . he is definitely wack . his silly rhyme style and dull voice sounds lethargic over uninspired beats . as a member of `` children of the corn '' he was weak and he still is weak . the other member of his dip-set crew outshine him on his own cd ... how lame is that . through away any cam'ron cd 's you own and immediately replace them with music by jay-z .
music	i bought this cd six months ago because i am a miami vice fan . i did n't expect it to be good , but it is wonderful . `` in dulce decorum '' is incredible ! this is a hard-to-find cd . you will love it ! i enjoy it more with each playing
music	this is my all time favourite jacksons album . this album , along with `mama ca n't buy you love ' and anything by donna summer were hogging the airwaves during my first visit to the states as a kid . comprising mainly jackson compositions ( and production ) , it showed a more mature and funky side of the group , and was far more consistent than their hit filled but patchy motown works . filled with their trademark smooth harmonies , lots of horns and michael 's distinctive vocals , the album hit # 11 on the billboard album charts ( # 3 r ) , was certified platinum and had a smash hit single in `shake your body ( down to the ground ) ' # 7 pop . `blame it on the boogie ' opened the album in style , a funky upbeat disco tune that one could n't keep still while it played . other dancefloor anthems are the horn laden `things i do for you ' , the frenetic `all night dancin '' , and the shimmery `shake your body ' with its distinctive riff , which hinted at future mj songs like `do n't stop till you get enough ' and `workin ' day and night ' . for me however , the songs that really did it for me were the ballads . `push me away ' is a lush sun kissed ballad featuring a passionate vocal delivery from michael , alternating from full voice to falsetto with ease . great horns ! title track `destiny ' has an acoustic guitar intro which leads into an amazing ballad where michael declares `if it 's the rich life i do n't want it/happiness aint always material things ' . great backing harmonies too . `bless his soul ' is simply stunning ! featuring pensive lyrics about trying to do what 's right , but never seeming to please anyone . `you just ca n't please the world and yourself ' sings jackie . this song starts off tender with congas , fleeting horns and strings which after the second chorus builds to a superb climax of `the life you 're living is dangerous ' and a fab outro of `hey , ha ha ha ' . then comes the final track and my favourite . the dramatic `that 's what you get for being polite ' . a thumping piano leads to horns and sweeping strings , and then michael tells us the sad tale of some lonely guy named jack who wants to be what he is not and would do anything for love . dazzling instrumentation , a stellar vocal performance from michael , the cover art was a painting depicting the group with their huge afros , and the original vinyl release folded open like a book with individual shots of the brothers . one of my favourite childhood albums , one of my all time favourite albums , and a classic !
music	charlotte church had the most beautiful and captivating voice i ever heard when she debuted . i purchased all of her albums and played them to death . this cd is horrible ! her beautiful voice is no more as she makes no attempt to even use it . some of the other reviews said this release is the result of her growing up . ridiculous ! she could easily have kept the angelic voice as she grew . this is simply a tragic waste of talent
music	this is a wonderful vangelis album and is fairly energetic , with enough experimental flourishes to keep the listener fully engaged . released in 1975 , heaven and hell incorporates a full choir into the vangelis sound . vangelis played all of the instruments on this album including synthesizers , electric piano , acoustic piano , a full drum kit , and percussion . vangelis is joined by the english chamber choir ( conducted by guy protheroe ) with vana veroutis as the lead female vocal , in addition to jon anderson ( vocals/lyrics on heaven and hell ( part 1 so long ago , so clear ) . vangelis is quite a good musician and really shines on the acoustic piano . as a huge yes fan , i was delighted to hear jon 's excellent voice and cosmic lyrics . as far as the inclusion of the choir goes , i did not mind it that much and felt that it added a very interesting textural element to the recording . the heaven and hell suite is divided into two lengthy movements including part i ( 21'58 '' ) and part ii ( 21'16 '' ) . in general , the first part is more orchestral in nature and features the choir and excellent acoustic piano playing by vangelis . another general observation is that the first movement mixes vigorous sections that feature drums with spacey and haunting synth-dominated passages . of course , my favorite part comes at the end of part i , which is the 4'58 '' section with jon on vocals . this short `` song '' is quite moving and uplifting . movement ii is a little darker and more experimental than the first movement and is my favorite of the two . the choir is featured on the second movement , along with a beautiful wordless vocal by the very talented vana veroutis . part ii closes with a very spacey and quiet synthesizer section , which provides excellent contrast with the preceding thunderous percussion section . all in all , this is a good vangelis album and is recommended along with albedo 0.39 ( 1976 ) ; spiral ( 1977 ) ; and the excellent opera sauvage ( 1979 )
music	one of the best doobie collections out there `` greatest hits '' lives up to its name focusing on the singles the band recorded and that charted in their long career . some of the songs here are the single versions ( meaning they were edited and are shorter than the album versions ) and this might be a problem for some fans as they may want the full length versions of songs . maybe it 's because they were trying to squeeze more music onto the cd . either way fans may want to be aware of that . in fact even on the boxed set we get `` listen to the music '' , `` nobody '' and `` rockin ' down the highway '' in their single incarnations . perhaps its because that was the way fans originally heard them on the radio . either way , fans looking for the full length versions of these songs would do well to pick up one of the import `` greatest hits '' collections or wait for the remastered cds coming out later this year . this set does have one track not on the boxed set -- '' without you '' a great rocker . the cd booklet is exactly like the larger booklet that comes with the boxed set just laid out a bit differently . this definitely covers the highlights of the band 's career whether it be the tom johnston rockin ' years , michael mcdonald 's blue-eyed soul stage or the band 's reunion phase this has a bit of it all . personally , i would love to see a two disc distillation of the band 's `` greatest hits '' with a second disc of album tracks such as `` i cheat the hangman '' , `` losin ' end '' , `` the captain and me '' and `` how do the fools survive ? '' . in the meantime this single disc compilation will have to do for most fans . the sound is terrific pulling from the remasters produced by bill inglot for the boxed set . detail and clarity is remarkable and puts the previously issued `` best of '' pair to shame . this is the only place to get their singles from their first in 1970 `` nobody '' to their last ( when this compilation was put togetherin 2001 ) `` dangerous '' released in 1991 .
music	i bought this the year it came out , after seeing george in concert and it is great ! most of these were big hit songs and i found that i really loved the others too especially hard day
music	i love the `` smoky '' piano bar sound of this album . i picture my best girl having a couple of pops late at nigh
music	i 'm a bit surprised by the negative reviews , this cd is amazing . it 's not anything like soundgarden or audioslave - but it 's amazing none-the-less . every song on here is beautifully written , and , as always , cornell 's voice does n't disappoint . it 's different , but one of my new favorite cds
music	i consider this the first album in the second half of the career of oasis . following the departure of bonehead and guigsy , this album is basically all the gallagher brothers . having learnt lessons from be here now , oasis have gone back to a more basic style of production as opposed to the over the top production from be here now . while the songs are not as good on here , they sound better and the whole album sounds as if it was n't as rushed . this signifies a big change of direction for the band , with little less ego 's and a more sober approach to their music , it is only the songwriting that lets this album down . my least favourite of all oasis albums , it features two really good songs , 6 mediocre and 2 dreadful ones . it is missing another two songs to make it complete , i think it should have included the b'sides 'lets all make believe ' and 'carry us all ' . it still includes a few beatle-esque songs 'who feels love ' and 'roll it over ' and noel once again takes over lead vocal duties , this time on two tracks , 'where did it all go wrong ' and 'sunday morning call ' . this is a very important album , it grounded the band again after their ego 's had taken off . this helped relaunch the career and because of it they sound at their best today
music	i would call this the musical equivalent of the worst of abstract art . there are those that `` appreciate '' unintelligable works for fear of being thought stupid if they do n't . . . just as the emporer 's subjects `` ooh '' ed and `` ah '' ed in admiration of his clothing as he paraded naked in front of them
music	one ca n't go wrong with this one . a classic , which according to the well written liner notes was recorded 3 days after opening night . and , a pit orchestra that sounds like a pit orchestra ... before the days of electronic music
music	i was ( and still am ) a huge fan of `` mr. show '' . it was the only reason i kept my hbo subscription . it 's hard for me to believe that the same talent that created `` mr. show '' produced this weak offering . might be the least funny comedy cd i 've ever heard . virtually all the material in the album has been done before , and much better , by other comedians . most of the bits just lay there and die . mr. cross seems to realize this and tries to make up for it by saying f*ck a lot . sorry , it just does n't work . do n't waste you money on this one . get the `` mr. show '' dvds instead and forget this ever existed .
music	i just want to say that this record blows my mind ! only the japanese could come up with this musical hybrid that defies definition . only miss minekawa could inject such beautiful innocence into this thrilling aural rollercoaster of breaks , samples , and guitars . cornelius and dj me dj you are brilliant
music	this album is by far on the greatest recent live recordings . sheryl crow demonstrates her influence and talent by putting on an all star show with some of the biggest names in music history . sheryl shines on her own , singing some of her great hits , but it 's the duets that really make the album . my least favorite has to be the dixie chicks just because i ca n't appreciate the country flare they bring to `` strong enough '' but it 's still a great version . chrissie hynde , one of the album 's highlights , brings intense attitude to `` if it makes you happy '' , still one of my favorite sheryl songs . stevie nicks remains stevie nicks , giving more than enough emotion and flare to her own `` gold dust woman . '' sarah mclachlan 's usually soft voice comes out strong on `` the difficult kind '' and compliments sheryl 's quite nicely . my favorite rendition has to be eric clapton and sheryl together on cream 's `` white room '' , the rock-out moment on the album . the show is complete when all the guests return to belt out bob dylan 's `` tombstone blues '' and close the show with a definite bang
music	it sounds like someone somehow got the deftones to suck worse than they already do . this album is n't nearly as musically interesting as tear from the red . i do n't mind the singers new approach to vocals , but it just sounded like they did n't try at all . all the songs sound the same , the tempo is too fast on almost all the songs for the screamo sound , and hearing random voices and sounds of them in the studio between recordings just makes the album drag . although they 've goten much tighter as a band and are n't as sloppy as they used to be , ( they fell out of sync a lot in the opposite of december ) this album was definitely a backwards step in their progression as real musicians . save your money and buy tear from the red instead
music	while there are some flashes of brilliance in this album , it is compromised by a lack of direction . the 'tastes so sweet ' mix of rapture is beautiful , although cut far too short . faithless , afrika bambaataa & amp ; soulsonic , and crystal method are all good driving tracks at the tail end of this album . the high point , without contest , is darude 's ripping mix of rising star 's 'touch me ' . this is a cut to throw on for the peak ... when you find the party is just outside of barstow with hunter . that said , then there are all the uninspired tracks in the center of the album . these are more appropriate in an adolescent brit girl 's drawer next to the spice girls . for some labels , this would be normal , for ministry however , it is a dissapointment
music	this cd was beautifully sung by the cambridge singers , a boys/mens choir , mostly a ' capela . it 's the first christmas cd i 've bought that really tempts me to crank up the volume so i can revel in every note
music	jonny 's conversion is fine and i hope he is happy , but this album was not good if you are expecting the blues guitar work of his early albums . if you want christan rock maybe this could be for you , but he missed the mark with me big time
music	from the manic whirlwind prelude to the shocking cake and sodomy , portrait of an american family is an album that stands on its own two feet as being catchy and memorable . cake and sodomy dishes out the obscene gestures , lunchbox is told with a twist of humor , organ grinder is pleasing vocally , cyclops is addictingly wild , get your gunn is catchy ( if not overly insulting ) , dope hat is great and fierce , and my monkey is hysterically enjoyable . snake eyes and sissies is another winner , easy to get lost in . the rest all work to varying degrees , though not as appealing . every song on this album is worth listening to , from fast paced and rock style to techno overload .
music	i ordered the dvd of damn yankees to watch on tv for my daughter because she is doing a play and needed it for the day i ordered it . i paid for fast delivery because she had a deadline and we were thrilled to receive it on time but was very disappointed to see that it was the cd of only music ! i do n't think i will order from amazon again , it was my first time and probably my last . liz snyde
music	i bought the cd because i thought it was instrumental music . then i hit the tracks with vocals - yikes ! this is the only cd of lee ritenour that i bought . i am a first time listener . i must say that i do like the instrumental music very much . however , i really hate the tracks with vocals .
music	ya , abomination to god also set it right in his worthy review . i remember the days where this panzy was praised and all of you ate that `` one call away '' and `` right thurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr '' garbage . does 2 stars explain anything ? this apparently is equal to that d4l s*** , which is actually the lowest of the low . anyways , did n't i tell you chingy would die one year after -jackpot- hit ? now that he 's dead , everybodies focused on t-pain , oh s*** !
music	this cd just does n't have the quality it should . some of the songs have had the lyrics cut out or removed such as danny boy . i have the cassette and it was great but this just does n't do justice to ray price or his songs
music	roni griffith has just come out with her new release `` only you '' its great ! ! ! ! ! [ ... ] she has come back so much stronger . check it out . evi
music	i love plenty of contemporary country music ... everything from `` new bluegrass '' ( alison krauss union station ) to `` new country '' like reba mcentire , rascal flatts , brad paisley , martina ... even a lot of faith shania . but i think this cd is crap . the single star is for the only good song on the album , `` heads carolina , tails california '' -- but really , 1 star for one good song out of ten is a bit too generous . i 'm astounded at how bad the other 9 songs are ... elementary-school rhyming , uninspired melody lines , stupid lyrics , below-average accompaniment , etc . one of the most annoying things to me is her habit of overpronnouncing every word in a song ... i 'd guess someone told her at some point that she slurs her words , and she was trying to overcompensate . the result should be titled `` hooked on phonics , starring jodee messina . '' listen to the preview of `` on a wing and a prayer '' for a good example of what i 'm talking about . i thank my lucky stars i borrowed this cotton candy from the library , rather than shelling out $ 16 for one song . do yourself a favor and buy `` heads carolina , tails california '' online if you must have it
music	she does sound like a goat bleating . yodeling . it 's a shame , really .
music	i ca n't believe i just spent over an hour of my life listening to ten ( ten ! ! ) different mixes of this not too remarkable dance hit . by the third version , my brain turned to jelly . by the fifth , i needed a drink . by the final re-mixed version , my hangover already started to set in . this e.p . is for dj 's and masochists only . - tom rya
music	this cd should not have been released because it adds really nothing to this jarrett quartet 's other three releases . it 's like taking a fat paint brush full of cheap house paint and making a greasy mess of what was a very beautiful triptych . `` belonging , '' `` my song , '' and `` nude ants '' are all virtuoso , spiritually empowered performances and should by all means be purchased and enjoyed . but , i 'd go nada on this one if i were you . i was sitting with my 88-year-old mother listening to the last track and complaining about how lame it was and she said it was `` hum-drum . '' and she 's 88 , likes lawrence welk and it was past her bedtime . ( it 's past `` late night willie 's '' bedtime too , i hate to tell you . ) heck , i 've heard high school jazz bands cook twice as hot as this `` keith and the somnambulists '' incarnation . garbarek sounds like he 's going to give himself a hernia trying to get out the altissimos . i ca n't think of one interesting drum riff in the whole 61 minutes plus . ( neither can christensen . ) les scandinavianes sound like they need about 10 hours sleep and then , maybe , they start thinking about picking up musical instruments . jarrett is as wired as ever , but even he ca n't keep up with some of the tempos and the overall mood is disoriented , forced and cumbersome . how any reviewer can say that this release captures the quartet 's tight integration , displayed amazingly well elsewhere , is beyond me . with the exception of `` innocence , '' none of the compositions are very good , either . `` oasis '' has an interesting , if dire , melody line , but it ca n't summon the required ambience because of all of the clutter and dog poop around it . unlike the other three releases mentioned above , this one has very little magnetism - the first track is all rambling rose jazz , where none of the musicians are feeding off each other . i do n't enjoy this kind of jazz , so cliched and unintegrated . it contains that jarrettian need to rush things and gang jump the tempo with heavy-handed neurosis peddled as jazz fusion . you feel like some nut in a bmw is suddenly sitting 10 inches off your bumper , too demented to use the passing lane . ( yes , i know keith has mastered his scales and likes to crack knuckles with tempos and , yes , i now have a headache . ) there is an interesting part at the end , however , where garbarek cuts way back on the throttle and swaggers around in the lower and upper registers of his tenor sax in some nice ways . but the transition is contrived at best and bears no organic relation to the first part . only `` innocence '' benefits from the fact that these guys are probably taking a red eye flight to new york soon . it is a beautiful lullabye , arguably jarrett 's best composition . true , the `` nude ants '' version is all you need really , but something happens on this version of the song that is very special . jarrett puts in one of his best , if not his best , jazz piano performances . the composition is perfectly suited to his virtuosity and sensitivities and the somnambulists , who are still pulling a code 9 , ca n't screw it up even if they want to . ( there is a halo around keith jarrett 's head i bet you . ) garbarek ( somnambulist # 1 ) plays the melody with a lot of heart , but he screws up the tempo in a very brief , weak improvisation . the man is tapped , knows it and decides it 's time to end the song . palle danielsson ( somnambulist # 2 ) misses a lot of notes ( doubly bad on double bass ) and goes off into an ill-conceived , top-heavy improvisation right at the beginning of the song . like garbarek , he knows enough to stop and retreat , letting jarrett take over . i ca n't remember a dang thing about somnambulist # 3 ( christensen ) . but jarrett 's effort can not be touched and he plays like a true wizard . a week later at the village vangard ( `` nude ants '' ) , they 'll all be playing at this level . if anything , i 'd like to see the pm version of `` innocence '' included in a compilation of the best concert performances by this quartet rather than a whole release of this mediocre concert . for the most part here , we get hum-drum mountains , where many of the great riffs from the releases mentioned above are handled like a shaky old butler serving up tea , with people getting burned and tablecloths getting ruined . in particular , garbarek 's performance on `` nude ants '' is far superior to this one and maybe the mean streets of greenwich village got his `` norwegian up . '' maybe they were n't so sure if they were going to make it back to the hotel alive - new york used to be like this you know - and , well , it just might be your last gig . on `` personal mountains , '' it 's all polite `` thank yous '' and japanese clapping robotically . not a tinkling glass of booze in the whole schmooze . not even a bonze meditating for more . but , that manfred eicher , such a card , i tell you .
music	rare are the electronic albums that are so consistantly inspired . melodies are beautifully simple and soothing , sounds are particularly well crafted . a great album . the drum box could be a bit more discreet though
music	nothing deep , by any means , but simply a light , airy listen , with a compilation of quirky tropical tunes . even though the songs ( most of them ) were n't in the movie , they remind me of it , of the whole hawaiian atmosphere . my favorite tracks , excluding the ones included on the previous cd , are blue hawai'i ( by elvis ) , my little grass shack , coconut ( it 's just bizarre , but addicting , making you smile with absurdity ) , island in the sun , pineapple princess , and love me tender . again , it 's nothing dramatic or swirling , but it you adored lilo stitch ( and how can you not ? ) and all it stood for , this cd might just bring some warmth into a cold day . do n't think about it . listen and pretend you 're there
music	this album is pure crap ! just a marketing move to capitalize on the sales from straight outta cashville , until he can make a real new album , not this microwaved crapola . if you like buck , get straight outta cashville , an beg for mercy , than wait for his future release , with actual new tracks . i strongly advise you not to buy this . it is a total rip off . i wasted my time downloading this
music	ok , i just could not resist coming on here to review this . i 've had this cd for about 4 years now and i still listen to quite a bit , proof right there that this cd is definetly a classic ( in my book at least ) every single song on here is original , the guitar riffs are simply amazing , and the lyrics i can not even describe in words how much they hit home and how breathtaking they are . if your a goo goo doll fan , and you still do not have this cd , i deeply encourge you to go buy it now ! this is the is the goos like you 've never heard them before . the cd is pure genius , and in my opinion the best cd i 've ever heard
music	did you lose interest in new rock in the past several years because all those loud songs on the fm station sound about the same ? maybe you noticed one song in there somewhere that had memorable hooks and interesting lyrics among the crunching guitars ? the libertines are - or at least were - one of those diamonds in the rough . their raw , loud style is closer to punk than any other genre , but most of their songs are more well-developed than that suggests and might even appeal to classic rock fans . make no mistake , though , this is a loud album . with the exception of the oddly balladish `` radio america , '' it 's a pretty steady sonic assault , and the lyrics are mostly somewhere between `` louie louie '' and live dylan on the intelligibility scale . what can be understood is more erudite than you 'd expect , though . `` what a waster '' is a frighteningly vivid look at drug addiction , `` boys in the band '' is the best groupie song i 've heard in a long time , and `` the good old days '' actually reveals a touch of sentimentality just under the power chords . decipherable or not , most of the other songs are at least very catchy . the whole collection is a nice balance between aggressive style and memorable songs that has been all too lacking for a long time now .
music	van dyke parks did the arrangements on sam phillips 's debut 'the indescribable wow ' , an album i love so much i thought i 'd give 'song cycle ' a shot . what a feeerocious disappointment ! i 'd give it zero stars if i could , but amazon would n't let me ! my god , that singing voice of his reminds me of david bowie ... `` the laughing gnome '' bowie , that is ... i 've seen the word `` coy '' pop up in a lot of reviews to describe his singing , er , style , but i 'll go them all one better ... `` smug '' . all i hear in it is `` ooh , i 'm so smart . what a clever lad am i . '' the arrangements or orchestrations , or whatever you call them are all pointless . it gives me the feeling that van 's dad bought him an orchestra and said , `` here , son , have fun . '' so young van did ... without ever really learning how to use it properly . randy newman knows how to use an orchestra ; check out his best album 'sail away ' . the arrangements are tasteful and , key word here , spare . he never clubs us over the head with them . the lyrics , if we can call them such , have no attachment whatsoever to the music ... . but then again since i wrote that the arrangments are pointless i guess it 's to be expected . so , what we have is a trifecta of awfulness : bad voice , bad lyrics , and bad music . however , he did make 'song cycle ' in 1968 and worked on 'the indescribable wow ' in 1988 ... so he did learn a thing or two in 20 years , namely that arrangements are not songs ; they 're used to highlight a certain verse or chorus the singer really wants to put across to the listener ... maybe randy pulled him aside once to tell him that ...
music	the songs just did not get me dancing . i have to say i was disappointed . but i love kids favorite songs vol 2 but was never able to buy it as it was not availabl
music	i bought this recording along with blood on the tracks recently and all i can say is `` doggonit '' it do n't get any better than this . they called elvis the king but bob dylan must be the `` wizard '' . who will tell us great stories when he is gone ?
music	i am very dissapointed with this dualdisc , because there is no comment ( worning ) about dvd region protection . what can i do with this disc - region 1 , in europe ( region 2 ) ? my message for sony corporation is : `` this format will not exist for long with dvd region protection ! sorry. '' . my first , and last dualdisc . back to the sacd
music	as a band , the byrds are one of the greatest and certainly one of the most influential bands in rock and roll history . adding to that legacy , `` mr. tamborine man 's '' status as one of the greatest debut albums in rock history is almost without question . this band could do it all ; country , folk , rock , jam , psychedelica , etc , etc . and this debut was perhaps the pinnacle of their achievements . though they would venture into much more adventurous territory ( `` notorious byrd brothers '' ) , this was where the band was the most solid , the most tight collectively . dylan 's influence is everywhere from the get-go ; 4 of his songs span the album , including the title track which the byrd 's turned into his only # 1 hit . elsewhere , there are two other covers , but the songs with the best longevity are originals , mostly penned by gene clark . witness the tortured romance of `` i 'll feel a whole lot better '' and `` here without you '' and tell me he was n't a great songwriter . roger mcguinn ( or jim , if you like ) was quick about finding his signature nasally croon that would go on to influence tom petty , among others . obviously , not everyone had found their place ; songs by chris hillman and david crosby are nowhere to be found . but `` mr. tamborine man '' stand today every bit as tall as the early works of dylan and the beatles . this is the album that set the standard for folk-rock from then on , from buffalo springfield to rem to toad the wet sprocket to the most current emo bands . overall : 10 out of 10
music	i put off buying this for many years . having heard many posthumous albums that were just hideous , i did n't want to taint my perceptions of the queen legacy . so i ignored this album . then , one day , i was listening to innuendo and that old curiosity crept in again . i came here and read many positive reviews , so i took the plunge . i came out the other side very content . the legacy had not been tainted . the album is uneven in places , but the songs that are good are very good ( mother love , let me live ) . with some albums like this , it is often easy to tell that the vocals were spliced in . now , i do n't know exactly how this was done , but the songs feel seamless , even the dance track `` you do n't fool me , '' which i can picture being blasted at high volumes in a late-night club . of course there is some sadness in the songs and that feeling that time is running out ( especially in `` mother love '' ) , but upon the conclusion of the album , i want to say to the brian and the boys ( men ) , `` you 've done good .
music	i am a motown , oldies , r & amp ; b , soul , love songs , music lover.i like the songs that hit the heart and soul and hearing them brings back memories that come alive to the rhythem and bill withers definately fits right in there . i do n't realy have a favorite artist because i like sooooo many of them but if i had to pick my top 10 , this album would be in there
music	the one song i know is a remake is `` goodnight my love . '' i know this because i have it on the original 45 issue and the cd version is an inferior remake . but the others with which i 'm familiar - but do n't have original vinyl to compare , only memories - seem authentic . the audio quality is great and certainly superior to some of the cds you find these days which are only re-recordings of old vinyl or cassettes .
music	only way you are gon na like this music is if you are some depressed emo kid who listens to punk rock music just because it is punk , and you think that 'll make you cool . this cd just does n't display musical talent , maybe originality , but this is not high quality music
music	i 'm not sure what took me so long to get it , but i 'm just coming across this album . it never made a blip on my radar i guess . anyway , i saw it at a local record store in the used bin for $ 2.00 and it was hardly used -- even the jewel case was flawless ( it looked like it was only played once and then taken back to the store ) . obviously the owner before me did n't know what they had on their hands and the store manager did n't know either due to it 's low price tag . balance is a must have album without question . it came out in '03 , i 'm just getting it here in late '05 and it still sounds fresh . there are so many bangers on this album that listing them would make this a five paragraph review . of the 16 joints ( including the bonus track ) , i 'd have to say that 14 of them are amazing . akrobatik rhymes with an honesty and realism that is rarely heard in rap ( even amongst underground emcees ) . the songs compliment and play off of each other without them all sounding the same . i did mention that there were two songs that i could 've done without . those songs are `` hand that rocks the cradle '' and `` always bet on ak '' . they are n't bad , but i find myself skipping them everytime i play this cd . balance is a must have lp . i still feel a bit cheated since i just found out about this album . there has to be some sort of promotion for this guy . i did get the black dialogue ( perceptionists ) album and i knew about the lost adats and the ep , but somehow i completely missed this one . do n't be like me , if you have n't heard this yet , grab it as soon as you can . you wo n't regret it . this is one of the best albums on 2003 . highly reccomended . standout tracks : time , woman ii , remind my soul , balance , hypocrite , limelight , front days , here now , wreck dem feat . mr. lif , cooler heads , feedback feat . diamond d , and bone crushe
music	while nothing in the film works very well except perhaps the chemistry between travolta and stowe , the sublime soundtrack is another story . descriptions such as `` haunting '' and `` soul moving '' are right on the money , one might also add ineffable to the list .
music	poison the well are one of those bands that i was really big on right when i first started listening to them , but which faded a lot pretty quickly . i ca n't really say why . i like their work , but it does n't inspire me the way it used to . still , i do like them , and this album particularly . maybe not as much as opposite of december , but whatever . yes , this is n't as 'hardcore ' as their older stuff , but i 've never been hardcore kiddie . ( i 'm a metalhead ) and frankly , being a modern hardcore band ai n't much of a compliment in my book . it 's funny , lotsa tech-metalcore and other 'core derived bands are good , but most straight hardcore/metalcore is staggeringly boring . so , while old ptw was semi-technical metalcore , this album is pretty much just extremely loud emo . but , they now how to be 'emotional ' and not come across as sissies , ( well , most of the time ) and jeff does n't sing in an unbearably affected manner . course , the 'extremely loud ' part helps a lot too , and jeff 's growls/screams are absolutely devastating . way better than on their previous albums , and some of the best extreme vox from anyone , ever . as an extremely heavy emo album , the instrumentation here is pretty bland . there is n't much real riffing going on , not in the metal sense anyway , mostly just a single note/chord repeated a great many times , than another one etc . but , the vox and atmospherics carry the day . the standout track is 'crystal lake ' , an absolutely bestial piece of deathcore . i 've listened to quite a bit of death metal in my day , but this has got to be one of the most devastating tracks i 've ever heard , largely because of the absolutely impassioned vox . lotsa extreme vox lack emotion , but never moeria 's ( probably spelling that wrong , sorry ) that , and the instruments are more noteworthy , very nasty and chaotic . also , it earns points for taking some of the seriousness out the genre with its jokey lyrics . ( for the culturally backward , this song is a first-person narrative from jason voorhees , killer of most of the 'friday the 13th ' films . hence the name 'crystal lake ' . ) there are no truly weak tracks here . 'ghostchant ' is a good opener , nicely displaying the extreme tonal dichotomy of the album , mixing the fierce screams with some nice melodic vox . 'loved ones ' is one of the very best tracks , again carried almost entirely by the powerful vox . tracks 5 is a cool two part thing mixing the rather pleasant , harmonica and bass driven intro with one of the more hectic , grinding main songs . the album takes a turn for the lighter at about track 8 . 'apathy is a cold body ' is a very emo-y track , but it 's got a lot of nice melody to it , so it works . 'sound like the end of the world ' is another strange one . it 's a slow doomy piece with oppressive atmosphere and a thick layering of vocal lines . not the best thing here , but it works and it earns some points for being different . yes , a solid , if not great album . check it out
music	nothing like eon . eon is the one . this was a hack sequel with no guts . very dissapointing
music	there 's always the argument that if bach had had a modern piano , he would have composed for it . let 's consider another possibility : if some style-insensitive time machine had delivered a piano to bach 's doorstep , he might have tried it out and rejected it as a bad idea , since it so obviously fails to serve the paramount musical ideals that inspired the high baroque composers . for listeners who understand what bach meant by equal temperament , it 's worth noting that the standard temperament of the modern piano bears no close connection to what bach was trying to demonstrate in these `` pedagogical '' compositions . in other words , the point is lost .
music	now , if we 're being completely honest and true to the stats this album is killing the charts , but maybe just because people are lowering their standards . besides , the fact that i dont like this girl because she is just too rough around the edges , this cd is no `` dangerously in love '' . where beyonce 's sultry vocals and powerhouse notes highlight her entire album , cole 's raspy voice and sometime-y pitch concern me . aside from the obvious car banger `` i just want it to be over '' and the wildly popular `` love '' ( which cole butchers when singing live by the way ) , nothing here surprises me . like i said , you can call me a hater , but with women like beyonce and fantasia around cole 's fire will probably be put out soon
music	well , unless you are a hardcore collector like myself ( had it originally on vinyl all those years ago ) , stay clear of this album . if you want to hear noise that you your wife/girlfriend/boyfriend could do yourself , then forget this album make your own noise . the best track on the album is the bonus track . that tells you that this album has nothing to do with beatles music . i give it one star for being terrible one star for the packaging ; - ) . search judemac forever '' on msn
music	this album is one of the best sonic youth album ... i advise everyone to listen this album ... break the circle of common popular music ... this album irritates your soul and freedback your dreams..
music	i like a little bit of it , doesent mean its good , i wont throw it away or anything , ill just let it sift ... wait ... and look at the album cover most of the time . slayer is getting better though
music	you wo n't stop bobbin yo head until its over . i bought this when it first came out and we still bump this at every party we go to and everyone is happy to hear it , cougnut is easily as good as biggie ever was , he just never got the exposure that biggie did
music	a great recording . `` the greatest bass solo ever recorded '' ( as put by another reviewer ) is certainly a stretch , but the album is still magnificent . heavy sounds is a title that accurately describes the music . buy and enjoy .
music	i heard from a number of people that amon amarth were an excellent death metal band , so with that in mind , i though i 'd try osftgh . what i hear , and it certainly seems i 'm missing out on something , is sloppy musicianship and poor songwriting . just because you have mead dripping from your beard , and you scream out lyrics that contain , no mercy , vengeance and `` it 's your time to die '' does not mean you can create `` authentic '' viking/metal . these idiots could definitely take lessons from : enslaved , manegarm , falkenbach to name a few . do n't fall for the hype !
music	it might not be a good album but it definitely shows shania 's potential
music	a lot of people are saying that this album is better than their 1st one . that 's not saying much because their 1st album was terrible . there was only one direction they could go -- up . it 's hard to imagine them doing worse than their first lp . i said this about the young , fly , flashy album , and the same applies here , so i 'll say it again : when the hottest line on your entire album comes from bow wow , your album is in serious trouble . but let me balance that statement though . this is n't exactly one of those album you buy when you want lyrical gymnastics . this is simple , bass heavy , crunk music . it 's effective in it 's purpose , but it 's totally generic ( the recipe for most party songs ) . and some of these songs are just flat out horrible . `` stop callin ' me '' is n't only horrible , but it is n't about anything if you 're paying attention to the wack lyrics dfb put on it ( and whoever wrote the hook should be slapped ) . and who 's idea was it to let dame dash ( yeah , that dame dash ) scream all over a song ( bricks 4 the high ) ? i want to know who the guy was that said `` yeah , that 's a good idea '' . dame is doing what he does best , so he 's not at fault ... ..i blame the idiot that put him on the song . `` suckas come and try me '' is probably the worst song to come out of the south since drama dropped his album . and if you ask me , the `` white tee '' remix was a step backward from the original . it would help if they could talk about something other than `` haters '' , postin ' up on the block ( i swear they say that on the album at least 100 times ) , rims , jewelry , and weed . but expecting them to change up their sound would be silly on my part i guess . besides , if people buy this , why should they change ? that 's another story though . in short , the album fails to seperate dfb from the pack . the beats are generic and the rhymes are terrible ( `` i 'll make you 1 2 step like ciara '' ? come on , i could write that in my sleep ) and it 's hard to tell if there are four rappers or just one because they all sound similar . once you understand the purpose of this album though , then you can find a few decent tracks , but do n't go getting your hopes up just yet . there are only 3 or 4 songs worth hearing . `` my music '' is listenable and dfbs put down some decent lyrics that are helped out by bun b 's good appearance . the best beats on the album are on `` do n't play with me '' feat . three six mafia and `` freaky as she wan na be '' . `` do n't play with me '' features production from dj paul juicy j , so you know it 's tight . i love three six , so that 's my favorite song on the album . and `` freaky as she wan na be '' will be the second single off the album if they 're smart . on top of our game is good for what it 's supposed to be good for ( partying and ... .well , that 's it ) , but not much else . jermaine dupri is trying his best to keep his label relevant , but i do n't know if this approach is gon na help him any . this album is better than their debut , but that 's not really saying much . this should be pretty obvious , but i 'll say it anyway . if you 're into lyrics , then this is n't for you . if you want crunk beats to bounce to , then this is right up your alley . it depends on your preference , but this listener has heard better crunk music and recommends passing on this one . standout tracks : freaky as she wan na be , i think they like me ( remix ) feat . jd , da brat , bow wow , do n't play wit me feat . three six mafia ( my favorite ) , and my music feat . bun b .
music	for anyone who loves trumpet music as i do , this album is a must . wynton marsalis has mastered twenty all-time favorite pieces with such brilliance , that no other trumpeteer comes near by comparison . opening with j. clarke 's , the king 's march , wynton proceeds to favor listeners with such baroque favorites as purcell 's entrada from `` the indian queen , '' j. clark 's the prince of denmark 's march and j. stanley 's trumpet voluntary . fantastic selections from bach , mozart , and haydn follow , with the album also including such delightful listening as the last rose of summer , carnival of venisee , and flight of the bumblebee . you wo n't be disappointed with this purchase
music	it 's impossible to like all of country music , but randy travis is liked by even those who do n't like country music . from 1986 and through the 90 's he was always on top or near the top of the country charts . his calm , nasal drawl reminds me a bit of lefty frizell , but there 's no mistaking his unique style . these are some of the best recordings in the history of country music including digging up bones , forever and ever , amen , too gone too long , is it still over ? , hard rock bottom of your heart etc . randy had 16 no . 1 's on the country charts . there are 20 cuts here . if you only want one cd with all his greatest hits this is your logical choice . by the way , the sound from rhino is bright and punchy and the booklet features dates , neat pixs , and peak positions . you 've got a winner for life with this one !
music	the lady can sing , but her `` christian '' message is compromised because of her part in `` chasing papi '' , where she played a woman who - had she had the chance - would have hopped into bed with her on-screen boyfriend prior to marriage . it 's `` crystal clear '' to me that jaci broke my heart in a million pieces when she played that part . it 's really tragic to see such a beautiful young lady with such a opowerful voice and message now reduced to nothing more than a hypocritical wannabee , much in the same way that stacie orrico is now becoming ... ..and is it just me , or is it coincidence that these two womens ' album covers look strikingly similar ? it appears their paths in life are similar , too : compromising a message and a stand that once set them worlds apart . as with a recent review of orrico that i made , i 'll give jaci velasquez her due : she can sing , and what i mean by that is sing the roof off of a house ! this album was excellent ... ..was . now , whenever i think or hear of jaci velasquez , i can only think one word : hypocrite
music	i recently purchased this cd again . i once owned it on cassette . keith is a real smooth old school type singer and his music and sound has sustained very well since it was released in the early 90 's . if you are building an old school collection with great singers this is a good one to have . it 's great for romance or with that special lady . jaye price beltsville md
music	i went through a painful final separation from the love of my life when this cd was released in 1997 , and i identified with every song . i listened to this cd over and over for several months . i saw kim at the `` house of blues '' in hollywood during that time and sang along to every song . this cd is my favorite `` bitter sweet '' cd of all time . i love you , kim
music	gnr were a very overrated band . i found appetite for destruction very dull . this atleast has the band 's 3 great songs in november rain , civil war , and live and let die . get this for 3 great songs but stay away from gnrs other crappy songs and albums ! ! they are not metal !
music	not particularly musical ; only 1 good track ( blues for miles ) ..
music	i have to admit that even though i am a big fan of diesel boy , this cd was very boring . the beats are too similar on every track , and the cd as a whole just has no `` feeling '' to it . if you want to hear him at his best , by 97 octane
music	this is the soundtrack that led me into the wonderful world of glam rock ! it is outstanding and i could just play it again and again ... . it is certainly one of the most brilliant albums out there and probably my favourite soundtrack of all time .
music	layla is one of the most overrated songs of all time . cream is one of the most boring bands in history . why not do yourself a favour and buy enjoyable bands like dire straits , and metallica who rock . ps.this clapton compilation has no good songs so please do n't buy it at all
music	actually garth hudson , the former organist of the band does not play on this cd ( nor 'every geriatric rockstar's ' ) . the musician you might be referring to is al garth ex of loggins/messina
music	all i got to say about this is that dudes need to stop making this kinds of records cuz this is not hip hop , its not what ll , rakim , krs-one , kool g rap , ice t , ice cube , nwa , and ( rip ) big and pac , started . we as fan have the power to end this buy simply not buying the album . please do not buy this , this fake rap is got to sto
music	i loved '' careless love `` and saw madeleine live here in rio de janeiro in a reasonably good show.i am quite disappointed with this album however because i had great expectations.let 's face it folks , however smoky and billiesque her voice is she is never going to have the power and the range of the original.she needs to be really close miked and well recorded to get that voice to sound right.this is obvious from seeing her live . so what were those marketing executives thinking by promoting a cd full of soft and slow ballad covers that are obviously going to turn a huge spotlight on her vocal delivery ? those songs need an ella , a sarah vaughn , or even a shirley horn -to name some giants- to have a chance of pulling it off with their huge range , timing and phrasing . to compound the problem , the recording engineers/producers did not do a great job on her voice or the rest of the band for that matter.everything is much too soft and distant ( unlike careless love ) .if you want an atmospheric but still powerful sound you must produce something like the last shirley horn cds . last but not least the rest of the good band are not allowed to play anything remotely interesting but are relegated to very minimalist backing chores . i think there is a misconception with the record excecs that m.p . has the qualities to make her a modern pop-jazz diva ala diana krall.she has to find her real voice and the correct material to match.good luck .
music	overdrive , watching the rain , enchanted , teaching myself to dream , glow , lemon , because i can are really excellent songs , this album is really worth it .
music	i do n't understand the previous reviews - i found this recording positively dreadful , with ruthie henshall being the only one worth listening to . john sinclair is abominable as george - he sounds like he 's doing a ( bad ) imitation of michael crawford in `` hello , dolly . '' he does strange things to his words - i guess he 's trying not to sound british , but why is he singing `` summ-ar weath-ar '' instead of `` summer weather '' ? the ilona is a bass - almost literally . `` i resolve '' has been lowered for her , and yet she still can not master the range of the song . to accomodate her , the second part of `` i do n't know his name '' has a truly odd key change . were she remotely talented i could understand key changes to facilitate her singing , but she 's not worth it . the orchestrations are odd , too , with strange sleigh bell sounds appearing frequently . the rest of the singers range from fair ( kodaly - a pretty voice but not much expression ) to bad ( mr. maraczek drags down every single note of `` days gone by . '' luckily this is his only song . ) the broadway revival , to my ear , still has the best voices , except , of course , that barbara cook ( the original ) outshines diane fratantoni , who is merely good ( but who was a vast improvement over the roundabout 's original amalia , the annoying judy kuhn . ) get the original or revival recordings instead - this london version i would recommend only to die-hard she loves me fans , or masochists . i 'd rather sit through another terrible viewing of `` you 've got mail '' than listen to this again
music	very interesting cd . some of the vocals are distracting , but the music is driving modern psychadelia . as i said , think syd barrett 's floyd mixed w/ melt bannana . i highly recommend
music	'live etc ' is an absolute must-have compilation for all true gong fans.it features a total of fifteen live tracks of tunes that originally appeared on the band 's key albums 'camembert electrique ' , 'flying teapot ' , 'angel 's egg ' and 'you'.taken from unreleased live soundboard tapes ( i assume ) from shows between 1973-75.absolute best cut here is `` where have all the flowers gone ? '' along with `` 6/8 tune '' , that are the disc 's only unreleased material.other cosmic gems include `` dynamite/i am your animal '' , '' isle of everywhere '' , '' oily way '' and `` master builder '' .duration is 78:33.heard they wanted to add the 16th cut that was originally on the 2-lp record , but the cd simply would n't hold it.talk about wanting to give your fans their money 's worth.long live the mother gong ship ! recommended
music	when a young artist names her first two albums not `` judy '' or `` collins '' but `` a maid of constant sorrow '' and `` golden apples of the sun '' , you know she takes herself seriously.originaly released in 1961. and 1962. their names were all i knew until i saw this cd recently . `` who will buy this ? '' i wondered just to see the only copy snatched right in front of me.the comparisons with first two baez albums are inevitable ( some songs were recorded by both ) althought collins shows much more passion and involment where baez seemingly seduces herself with the beauty of her voice.on these early albums collins is frighteningly devoted keeper of the flame and her repertoire is almost exclusively traditional - which means not only ethereal beauty but also a certain ( to some ears , overpowering ) seriousness , cleverly mellowed by inclusion of joyous `` o daddy be gay '' , a cousin to her `` grandfather '' recorded years later.althought i honestly love these songs and listen only this cd for days , these early albums are today much more significant as seeds of collins later trademarks ( voice will soar much higher in the future , she slipped w.b.yeats into traditional folk collection just to later blossom into first-rate art-pop singer ) and as they were product of their greenwich village times , they may sound a bit dated to some modern ears.but they are still hauntingly beautiful to me , i waited their re-release for too long
music	much improved voice , same great guitar . slow album , especially on his two remakes . country sound on no reason to cry ( beautiful solo ) . this cd would have been a 6 stars had he mixed in a thunderstorm to the background of gon na rain today
music	sorry , ya just ca n't replace michael hutchence . this is a great overview of all of their greatest hits . i am not a huge fan of greatest hits cds b/c people tend to buy them and , therefore , miss all of the excellent songs that were n't released as singles . all inxs cds are worth buying separately . but , if you must ... ..this will work
music	for the longest time , i have thought that observational truths were highly prone to being the most piercing of things : i have believed that the truth could either hurt ( or disturb ) you terribly , or make you laugh so hard , to the point of hysteria -- or a combination of both extremes . there are many things to put this theory to the test , but to cut it all short , all one would need to do ( if by chance it has n't been done already ) is experience the observational humor of richard pryor to possibly get a better understanding of what i am talking about . this classic comedy album from 1975 is a prime example . richard pryor has been hailed as a genius by many , and i would have to agree : it takes plenty of intelligence and natural talent to be a comedian for starters , but to also turn many disturbing observational truths of everyday life into something painfully , body-breakingly hilarious takes a whole lot of something as well . from the very beginning , to the tail-end of this cd , 1975 's _is it something i said ? _ is a non-stop laugh fest , that personally gets *me* laughing so loud and hard , i end up pretty much abusing almost every part of my body in the process : my throat , my lungs , my sides , my stomach -- they all end up feeling beaten and worn-out . richard 's takes on drugs , sex , race racism , relationships , and politics in general are every bit as painfully observational as they are profane -- and did i mention hilarious ? the racy quality of the material found here makes so much of what 's referred to as `` cutting-edge '' these days , seem so contrived and unaffecting ; richard 's observations seem just as relevant now -- if not more so -- as they were 30 years ago . i could n't be graphic in pointing out some of the sickeningly funny moments on this disc -- and there are many -- but i should say that the opening one-two punch of `` eulogy , '' and `` shortage of white people , '' and richard 's take on his own battle with cocaine addiction in the `` cocaine '' bit get me cracking up so hysterically , i sometimes need to be careful not to make myself sick . and again , those are just a few of the many hysterical blasts found here . richard pryor is considered a comedic legend for a reason . this album here is a good example as to why he is considered as such . just do n't play it for the kids , and for the love of god *don't* play it during the middle of the night ; you most certainly will disturb the beauty rest of your family , and your neighbors . and you know what could happen if you disturb one person 's beauty rest : just imagine what would happen if you disturbed the beauty rest of many..
music	this cd is a must for anyone who enjoys great guitar music . its packed full of amazing pieces and inspiring playing . my favorite track is is n't it romantic because it successfully makes a classic out of this song . buy it now ! !
music	if you are a fan of oscar peterson this belongs in your collection
music	i am a hater , to the core . i hate puffy and thats all it is to it . now there , you do n't have to say it.so on to the review . first off every lyrical line puffy spit in this album was outdone by everybody . every track he had the weakest flow and the worst rhymes . and thats the truth . i do n't know how true this is , but i heard loon was behind most of puffy 's lines on this album . so that should explain the utter wackness in his lyrics . the truth is i do n't care who writes his lines . it could be tupac and nas doin it , since its not them spittin it , then it actually takes away from the rhymes itself . almost this entire album is filler . the best tracks is real n**** and journey through my life . i really did n't feel that beat a whole lot but nas and beanie 's verses was off the hook . however that is not enough for me to give this album more than one star . now i love mc lyte and public enemy , but they should get smacked in the back of they heads with crowbars for lettin him mutilate their classics . thats not musical artistry , thats butcher work . fake thug dedication really gets under my skin . the title alone . no disrespect to biggie as an artist cause i do like him still . but they put a diss on tupac on life after death after he died , then denied it for years . so perhaps the fake thug dedication should be to him , cause thats some sucker s*** . i did n't hear his latest album , i 'm not going to review it , i did n't even visit that section . if you a fan of this guy , then you gon cop this and his new one regardless . if you like me and hate just about everything he puts out , you wo n't be caught within a mile of that s***
music	this is where afi began their sound change from their first 2 cd 's ( answer that stay fashionable , very proud of ya ) . it is much more serious than the first 2 , alot angrier , heavier , darker , and more screaming/yelling as well . some people say this is their best , i disagree , i prefer their `` punkier '' 1st 2 but i still enjoy this alot , it 's all down to personal taste , it gets a 5/5 for me
music	good music but a bad title ! elvis has left the planet but a new king has been born with the self proclaimed new king of rock and roll ken rondell at http : //www.cdbaby.com/cd/bigra
music	someone suggested i listen to this because i was , at the time , into what lame beret-wearing record-store dips would call `` creatively aggresive '' music . then it was death metal ( which i prefer without cursing or filth , you understand . ) since then i 've found the ascension into gabber and then full-on unmitigated hardcore . anyway , mr. bungle ... . tepid . uninteresting . bland . stupid . gives the chin-strokers something to fascinate over . let them . someone 's got the fuel the economy
music	their basically what would happen if you took p.o.d 's lyrics , and then added boring 1 chord riffs repeated throughout the whole song followed by the singer screaming the top of his head off about god and self-loathing in a noise-bleed inducing pre-pubescent girl voice , so you have a band so bad it makes god himself want to commit suicide . the song titles are also annoyingly bad , obviously made so they sound artistically genius ( but instead monotonous ) . and to everyone who thinks these guys are metal , they deserve to be buried alive . metal is fear factory , lamb of god , in flames , and arch enemy . these guys are about as metal as maroon 5 .
music	if you work in a comic book store , live in your mom 's basement , own a lot of black candles , and think that h. p. lovecraft wrote history books , then you might like this garbage . if you have a life , a clue , or a girlfriend , then you probably will not have any use for this stuff . i still ca n't figure out how record companies get away with classifying this pseudointellectual fluff as metal . it belongs in a category with sisters of mercy or morrisey . this record is completely lacking any imagination or energy : depressing teenagers is like shooting fish in a barrel . i guess if you want to play dungeons and dragons and fester about feeling like an outcast , this would be the thing to listen to . personally i think it 's a huge ripoff when somebody takes five minutes worth of music and stretches it out into an hour . do n't give these jokers your money .
music	i bought this based on reviews of `` bass queen in the mix . '' to me it sounds like the west coast edition of northern exposure without the 4/4 house beat . in other words , its very electronic sounding , almost completely non-vocal and not very funky at all . i listened to `` eargasm '' by plump dj 's and icey 's `` funky breaks '' after this and it 's definitely missing variety , skill in mixing and that `` neck snapping '' funky quality that make the plumps and icey so indispensible . not too bad but not that interesting either . i prefer her `` mixtress '' and still have not heard `` bass queen ... '' btw , my speakers are flat down to below 30 hz and i did n't find the recording quality or the bass that impressive . listen to crystal method 's `` phd '' or `` block rockin ' beats '' by chemical brothers after this to see what i mean
music	i bought this for my wife , a huge fan of patrick o'brian ( she 's read the books twice in the past two years alone ) . ironically , it now sits in my car 's cd shuffler where it undoubtedly gets the most airtime . i love this music ! as another reviewer mentioned , with some cofee ( killick , there ! ) , this music and desolation island in your hand , you feel transported to a life of long ago . when men sang to rouse the soul , brighten the spirit , damn the enemy and win the heart of their colleen ( sorry ... nancy ) - all with spine , mind and muscle fully intact . the harmonies are rich , the voices deep . and yet , the last reviewer 's questions have the faint ring of truth . my first hearing rang a bit flat , the music sounding just this side of stale . but , in the end , it just do n't signify . even on that first run , by the end of the cd i was clumsily , but merrily joining in with the crew . i suppose i have come to imbue the songs with a life of my own , belting them out at full volume down the highway . i hope you enjoy them as much as i do
music	i rarely write reviews , but i need to comment on how fantastic this compilation is . i have a four-year-old and an eighteen-month-old , and this cd is in heavy rotation at our house . my husband and i love the music at least as much as they do -- it 's stylish and sets a great mood as we 're making dinner and doing dishes . the kids love it too , needless to say . my four-year-old 's favorites are three blind mice ( she loves when the farmer 's wife squeaks that she 'll give back the tails ) and the final track by peggy lee ( where she says the word *poop* , as in `` party poop '' -- endless laughter ensues ) . ella fitzgerald 's a-tisket , a-tasket and chew , chew your bubblegum are priceless . all in all , i highly recommend this cd -- everyone will be happy to hear it again and again
music	while i love billie , in her own words , these sessions were dull , and uninspired . since the reviews should focus on one cd , that is the jist of it ; boring renditions , and back up musicians that are not the ones that billie was used to making for a very uneven collection
music	as a peripheral bnl fan , i have always admired the off beat sense of humor these guys dish out . with previous releases , i have been able to discover new things in repeated listenings . this cd got stale fast . seems to be geared to the tween crowd . i am hopeful newer releases will stay true to the bnl i have enjoyed in years past
music	i 've seen and heard sheryl live when she 's not surrounded by rock and roll dinosaurs . she 's great - she 's hip , self-assured and kicks butt ! but here , she tells the audience in `` leaving las vegas '' : `` i 'm playing central park tonight ... but i have some friends coming up so can you be patient ... please ? for lil ' ol ' me ? be very patient ... . '' almost begging the audience not to walk out while she 's singing solo . it 's almost as if she knows that the audience will have to suffer her solo attempts until the `` friends '' arrive . the irony is that sheryl solo is the best part of the album . with the others on board , we ca n't see what sheryl can do , and those familiar with her know that sheryl is capable of a lot . she 's overwhelmed by keith richard , stevie nicks , eric clapton , chrissie hynde and by including so many rock gods she herself is diminished in importance and stature . her songs `` it do n't hurt '' and `` there goes the neighborhood '' stand out on the album showing that sheryl can rock harder and better than any of her `` friends . '' too bad she did n't include `` am i getting through '' -- the part 2 of that was a great rock moment . natalie maines ' grating voice ( like fingernails on a chalkboard ) completely ruin `` strong enough . '' chrissie sounds like a zombie on `` if it makes you happy '' , sarah mclaughlin is so hopelessly unhip and white-bread in her lilith-fair mode that she adds nothing to `` a difficult kind '' ... in fact , by the end of the song sarah seems to disappear from the song as sheryl belts it to the end . that 's sheryl 's song and should remain so , tombstone blues stands out for its guitar work and the best part of `` all i wan na do '' is the new york audience . happy , white room and gold dust woman are three classic rock standards , so overplayed that anyone who grew up to 70 's fm aor radio has heard them ad nauseaum . problem here is that nothing new is added to them , they sound like karaoke versions . despite sheryl 's plea for patience , i was bored with the old-timers.they did n't bring sheryl 's career forward , only backwards
music	understand , i love springsteen . born to run is my second favorite album of all time . i have seen him live over a dozen times . i personally think he is the single most important american rock and roll artist ever ( with apologies to elvis , chuck berry and dylan ) . i even loved nebraska , so do n't tell me it 's an e-street band thing or a rock versus folk thing , but this album is unlistenable . some reviewers have called it beautiful and powerful . that 's rubbish . there is a complete absence of melody on this record , as was the case with much of the ghost of tom joad album ( with a huge exception being `` youngstown '' - a great song ) . the apparently willful attempt to alter his singing style to sound like woody guthrie or jimmy rodgers is just frightening . dylan could pull it off , bruce just disappoints . but it 's the songs and lack of anything remotely resembling melody that makes this record a failure . believe , i listened to devil dust 10-15 times in hopes of finding what i am apparently missing . i could n't . i thought the rising was a nice album . i even liked the devils dust solo tour ( bruce is a powerful performer , and maybe even more commading when it 's just him on stage ) , but i doubt this cd will ever find its way back into the player
music	great cd . imus in the morning recommended highly and the i-man was not wrong . one of the best cd 's i 've owned in years . i listen to a lot of buffett , james taylor , delbert mcclinton , and this cd places high in these ranks
music	what else can be said about this great cd ? it 's one of the best pop records ever made and you never get sick of hearing these 10 songs . `` child of vision '' is the best ( the piano solo is killer ) of the best , but this is one of those rare cd 's that you just pop in and let the entire thing play till the end ( no skipping over songs you do n't like ) . a true classic
music	i heard this song on the radio the first time many months ago ( and then for months and months it 's been played nonstop ) . i instantly hated it from the horrendous beat to the fact that gwen stefani is a 35 year old dressed up as a cheerleader with pom-poms and about 95 % of the song is spent on the chorus `` i ai n't no hollaback girl '' or `` this s*** is bananas '' section . pharell is a master producer and i chuckled because i thought that even the neptunes can produce an occasional flop . to my horror this song became the number one single for multiple weeks and became the most successful single of the entire summer ( maybe even the entire year ) . i do n't see what people like about this song but apparently there is something i 'm missing . like i said you either hate it or love it
music	i love this band and have all the rest of their cds
music	brubeck and desmond work their special magic here and produce their finest live recording . this is sophisticated improv to tame the beast . i have listened to these tracks uncountable times and i never get tired of them . this is truely a wistful soundtrack to transport one to a higher realm . try this the next time you are caught in heavy traffic on a rainy afternoon . you wo n't mind the delay . it never fails
music	back 2 da basics *1/2 stars yo gotti has made some decent albums , but this one is just so ridiculous and silly that it made me sick , gotti who thinks he put memphis on the map , has some good songs here and there , but the rest are just ridiculous , obnioxus and real pretentious . this is not a good album thumbs down
music	this is an endurance test . as in 'bitches brew '' live evil '' love at the fillmore ' latter day miles consists of moments of brilliance combined with long stretches of absolute tedium . it makes 'jack johnson ' a real non event and considering the quality of musicians on board it is a real surprise . take 'yesternow ' it takes for ever for billy cobham to find a beat . this is just self indulgence of the worse kind , a trait which unfortunately perpetrated a lot of the jazz fusion crossovers . miles seems to want to create 'moods ' and ends up with twenty minute plus of wallpaper music . this album is the complete nadir of his jazz crossover period . mcgaughlin 's guitar though breathtaking in the mahavisuna orchestra here contents himself with silly little runs , totally without any structure and fire ( this unfortunately was the same throughout his stay with miles ) disjointed would be too kind a word . when you reliased that this was edited from long jams it makes you wonder how dull the unreleased parts were ( i dread to even contemplate ) . miles playing though usually inspired and lyrical here struggles to solo over the fast tempo 's and is embarassingly weak . maybe if i saw the film it was supposed to accompany i might view this differant , but without that it is just a meandering and unfocused mess
music	wow , i can not believe that two of the best songs of the film were cut off . 1.- rock and roll part ii ( gary glitter ) and 2.-get it on ( t. rex ) . the rest has been said in the other costumers reviews .
music	i am just writing this review to correct alexander from russia , who cites this album as a christianity peddler . leonard cohen is a jew , who unlike bob dylan ( on john wesley harding ) embraces his sense of jewish heritage and religion within his music . alexander , you 've brought your own interpretation to what is a distinctly jewish artist and his work
music	i have both the `` heat '' and `` seduction '' cd 's by oscar lopez and listen to both of them with wonder . this man is magic . i have about 20 `` new flaminco '' cd 's and these are right at the top as far as my tastes are concerned . oscar , if you 're listening , i check at least once a month for your next one
music	i cant understand how anyone can give this album more than one star . luckily i got this cd for free when they were handing them out to everyone who came to their shows on their 2005 tour . i love classic journey , but this band has gone downhill faster than i ever thought possible . most of the songs are terrible-boring music and even worse lyrics . 'arrival ' was pretty mediocre , but this is about 5 steps down from there . granted , steve augeri does complete justice to the old songs in concert and really sounds great , but he obviously has nothing to offer in the way of songwriting . the only way this band will ever create quality new music is if perry were to stop sitting around at home and come back to the band . otherwise , the band should seriously consider not making any more new music and just go on tour every couple of years
music	this will be short . it is worth the price of this album just to hear the branford and harry connick jr. duet carolina shout . that being said , all of the other tracks on this album are excellent . from jungle blues to doug wamble 's solo guitar on autumn lamp , with this record you get a pile of blues and at the same time gain an appreciation for romare breaden 's art . a must have . branford keeps outdoing himself
music	... yes , the beatles by which i 'm not comparing supergrass to them . no , supergrass are riding the road built by not only the beatles , but other british rock'n'roll greats like the kinks , david bowie , the zombies and many others . but the exploding energy of supergrass delivers a deeply satisfying listen that does not exist as frequently in the present 2000 's . this will definitely be a group that will represent the virtouso side of british rock'n'roll of the 1990 's and 2000 's , and without doubt represent the bohemia-intellectual-hard rocking spark that has lighten recent generations that has been going on since circa-sgt . pepper . an intoxicating and highly addictive album . 100 % recommended for anyone any age .
music	the singing is terrible on `` fly me to the moon '' . do n't take my word for it . listen to the free sample supplied by amazon.com . at 16 seconds into it , when she sings `` all i worship and adore '' , she goes almost a whole note sharp for several notes ! even someone with no musical training can hear it . the rest of the pieces sound fine
music	i ca n't say enough how great this album is . grant green was one of the most soulful jazz guitarists who ever graced the planet . his soloing on this cd is filled with beautiful melodicism matched with a bluesy grit that is such a pleasure to listen to . and for me as a guitarist it has been an encyclopedia of how to play blues from a jazz perspective . my favorites are `` miss ann 's tempo '' and `` blues for willarene '' . it is such a shame that he died so young and never collected his just due
music	the 1 star is for this 5 star cd box set being no longer available . does anyone know why or if it will be reissued soon ? i have the highlights cd and the `` live at the plugged nickel '' double lp - but not being able to buy this is disappointing and puzzling . thank you in advance for any help . scott k fis
music	i ordered mine from here ( amazon marketplace ) a couple weeks ago , and i 'm a very happy camper . this is one of the best online purchases i 've made in a long , long time ! first of all , there are songs i 've never heard before , so by owning this compilation , it helps me get to know the band 's material , or siobhan 's own solo stuff much better . all the songs are very well-written and catchy . thanks to my best friend , he drew me toward 's ss 's music back in the 90 's with the `` hormonally yours '' cd . ss 's music was always something i pushed to the `` back burner '' because i did n't know what to make of it . but in the past 2 years , i 've focused on the new material from the `` shakespears sister # 3 '' album ... and it blew me away ! siobhan is a true musical genius ! `` i do n't care '' seems to be a differnt version . it 's much brighter fresher-sounding than the album version . wow ! `` hello ( turn your radio on ) is my favorite `` ss '' song of all time also appears to be a different version . just hearing the first notes from it , my eyes got all teary . it 's just the way i am , regarding this song . the clock ticking at the end reminds me of a heartbeat or something . dark songs like this draw me near . lol the compilation is missing one song `` bitter pill '' . i wanted hoped for this song to be released on the cd , but unfortunately it did n't make it . awwww ! the liner notes booklet is packed with all lyrics , cool photos and a fine page of background regarding the recordings of their albums . siobhan is one cool gal ! i love the front back artwork , for it is both amusing , colorful dramatic . i 'm a sucker for dramatic stuff like this . hopefully , siobhan will continue recording lots of new material , using the `` shakespears sister '' title . i despise the crap we hear on the radio nowadays . hopefully now that sf has released this package , the music will get more airplay . i like the nostalgic aspect of music from a decade ago , because it reminds us of how the music industry used to be non-commercial and fun . yes ... it 's too bad that siobhan and marcella broke up , because their 2 uniquely different voices complimented one another . there has n't been a duo like them since ! my thoughts on the dvd ... i love it ! the first only video clip i 've ever seen from `` ss '' is `` stay '' . totaly blew me away since the first time i saw it . i 've always loved seeing siobhan as `` death '' , in her starry crown black `` glitzy '' outfit . she makes the perfect female version of `` death '' . i could never understand the video until now , because i never had the chance to see the entire thing on tv . the other videos are equally great and draw me closer each time . i appreciate the `` chaptered '' menu for the videos . at least i know what 's from where . the dvd was put together very well , and is packed with great stuff . fortunately , my dvd player on the computer and the tv can play this all-region pal dvd . i have n't experienced any difficulties ( skipping tracks or anything ) . it all plays fine . actually , when i purchased this item online , the item description said `` ntsc format ( usa canada ) ... so that 's why i bought it . it may not apply to everyone 's purchase , though . disc one ( cd ) : 01- you 're history 02- heroine 03- break my heart ( you really ) 04- dirty mind 05- waiting 06- goodbye cruel world 07- stay 08- i do n't care 09- hello ( turn your radio on ) 10- i can drive 11- excuse me john 12- can u wait that long ? 13- do i scare you ? 14- white rabbit 15- was it something i said ? disc two ( dvd ) : 01- break my heart ( you really ) 02- heroine 03- run silent , run deep 04- you 're history 05- dirty mind ( remix ) 06- the russian film ( featuring dirty mind heroine live in leningrad 1988 ) 07- goodbye cruel world 08- stay 09- i do n't care 10- catwoman ( live ) 11- my 16th apology ( edit ) 12- hello ( turn your radio on ) 13- i can drive additional features/info : - biography ( same as on 1st page of linernotes booklet ) - photo gallery with audio ( music ) - credits ( for videos ) - cd total playing time ( 62:03 ) if you 're an `` ss '' fan , this item is a must have ! regardless the price , it 's definitely worth owning ! thank you , amazon , for making this item available through your marketplace
music	del spits brilliant lyrics and produces excellently ... the beats of songs merge together as tracks change ... el-p makes a cameo ... casual makes a cameo ... prince paul produces a track ... get this album
music	jigga is incredibly hot on this album beanie is good to great . memphis bleek , is really good on this album , but is overshadowed . his `` 534 '' shows how good he is , this album does not . overall as an album it does a good job of showing off roc a fella , but not to much about the dynasty
music	although the real roots lie with the black artists who inspired these guys , the pbbb is where the hippy generation , ( this is a couple years pre-san francisco , and before the stones and beatles began stretching their arrangements out on record ) , learned to just play . their next record was more representative of what they were actually doing live at time time , and is the single greatest influence on what became the san francisco sound of the late 60 's and early 70 's , ( really long and experimental jamming ) , so this is in fact the `` roots of the roots of the roots '' of todays jam bands and guitar-heavy blues bands , mixed-race bands , and , for all practical purposes , the white-blues-man in todays ' world
music	this cd is , without a doubt amazing . stars are lost because prior to recording , you would think the guitarist would invest in a damn noise gate for his guitar rig . his tone is crushing sounds perfect , but the second he stops playing , every time ssssqqqqqquuuueeeaaaalllll . it 's annoying to the point of only being able to tolerate so many songs at once , because it is a chronic problem in every song .
music	i 've been waiting for this one.this disc and this group period was funky.movin was one of the baddest instrumental jams that i 've ever heard period.can you see the light is a tight jam as well.one of the many bad groups from back in the day
music	these songs are hacked up versons of rick 's music . i played it a couple of times until i got the library of original lps . the lps are better . at least they carry full versions of songs . i pass on rick and this package . rca cheats people out of good music..
music	although a couple of reviews said this was a great product , i was wary as i have never found anything that actually worked . i have a job where my mind is always on the go , and often have a week or two a month where i just ca n't get to sleep . the cd arrived during one of these times , i put it on my portable cd player not expecting too much , and almost imediately felt a bit queazy , nothing too bad , and on later research this basically proves the delta wave theory dr. thompson is working . the only time in the past when i have gone to sleep so easily when i have been out partying all night when i was younger . i play the cd on a stereo i have in my room , and i rarely wake up at all . i am certainly going to buy more of his cd 's
music	modern dub stylings from an assortment of recording artists , ranging from the bizarre and brilliant ( check the lost scrolls of hamarik 's darkly deranged how to find royal jelly ) , to the utterly unforgiveable ( namely , luciano 's appaling attempt at police & amp ; thieves ) . luckily for us , most of the tunes here fall into or around the former category , with great contributions from st. germain ( bouncing dub-disco on a dub experience ) , grant phabao ( updated roots righteousness on andub head yudu ) and boozoo bajou ( with the wonderfully cheesey divers ) . and let 's not overlook cottonbelly 's 90 's classic tempest dub , which resurrects an old scientist tune to spine-tingling effect . only the fairly plain seven dub and the aforementioned luciano really fail to ignite ... all in all then , a worthwhile collection which works very nicely as a whole - providing you program the cd player to skip the occassional duffer
music	in many ways , this album is everything one would have expected -- somehow the natural successor to `` no pussyfooting '' and `` evening star '' . in other ways , its nothing like i would have expected -- the usual stamps of fripp and eno 's recent work seems to be missing . its really quite hard to largely identify the identity of the musician generating the sound on much of this material , there 's obvious stuff ( we 'll come to that in a minute ) , but as a rule , the backgrounds could be either of them . sonically , it moves through a number of backdrops , with delicate , percussive , synthish loops dominating the early part of the record ( `` meissa '' , `` lyra '' , `` tarazed '' ) , wheras the middle of the record feels more like their old collaborations updated , the sort of modern fripp soundscapes being more apparent ( `` lupus '' , `` ankaa '' ) . the remainder of the album features on track that is totally unexpected , the downright funky `` altair '' , with its train shuffling rhythms , drum loops , and funky guitar ( in ways similar to material from the eno/schwaum `` drawn from life '' record ) , and the closer , `` terebellum '' , is an aggressive , haunting , and almost angry sounding piece almost reminiscent of `` radiophonics '' or the other more aggressive soundscapes . over this material , fripp largely solos using a variant of his legendary fuzz tone -- its a bit mellower , and rounder though , similar to his leads on `` starless '' and `` the power to believe part ii '' but in a more hushed feel . so that tells not much , the real question is , what 's it like ? largely an ambient affair , the collaboration is what you 'd expect -- there 's no real incindiery moments here -- do n't look for a `` baby 's on fire '' , but it is comparable to their previous collaborations in quality , and it certainly sounds nothing like crimson . some of it is full of delicate beauty ( `` lyra '' ) , some of its just a blast ( `` altair '' ) , some of its actually quite hard to listen to at all ( `` terebellum '' ) . for fans of ambient music , especially the work of these two gentelemen , this one will be quite rewarding . it falls short somehow of being a masterpiece , but it is really a great record . recommended
music	very very dissapointed . e-40 raps too quick , he is too hard to understand and he sounds like a trick
music	not only do you get some great music with this cd , you get the beginnings of climax as well . ( the last 2 cuts are essentially sonny geraci solo songs done by 1/2 of the band that would play on climax records ) includes their 4 hits ( time wont let me , girl in love , respectable help me girl ) and a slew of other very like-minded material . if you like any of their 4 hits , you will love the rest . if you like climax , you should buy this for the 2 last songs which are essentially climax tunes
music	a friend of mine gave me this cd about a year ago , i listened to a few minutes of it and was like `` what is this crap ? '' and i shelved it for a couple months . i then picked it back up and gave it another listen . to my surprise it was really catchy to me . the music ( and lyrics ) are simple , but thats what i like about them . theyre simple ! this is a great college-rock cd . i plan on checking out more teenage fanclub , and i suggest you do the same . notable tracks are sidewinder , what you do to me , and is this music ?
music	this tribute was announced almost ten years ago , and it seems to have undergone a transformation since then . to be fair , there are some interesting additions such as the sufjan stevens and brad mehldau tracks . and emmylou harris is brilliant . but sarah mclachlan 's `` blue '' has been heard before as has prince 's `` a case of you . '' earlier reports indicated contributions from heaviweights like steely dan and lindsey buckingham . i sure would like to have heard what they would have done . even more disappointing is that joni 's hejira-mingus era albums are mostly ignored - and that was her best music , in my opinion . as a final indignity , it sounds to me that too much compression was added in the mastering phase , and hence the overall sound quality of the cd is lacking in dynamics .
music	i love destiny 's child ... but this cd ... big disappointment . the best songs on the entire cd were probably lose my breath , cater 2 u and girl ... big disappointment ... i just wasnt feeling the cd when i bought it..
music	all the cds this band has made suck . not even the first one so never buy something this idiots have made . blink-182 , sugarcult or sum 41 are good punk-pop
music	i had first bought the `` here and now '' hoping to hear the original recordings , but was slightly disappointed that on that cd the older songs were live performances only . if you want their hits as you remember hearing them on the radio or your old album that may be trashed , this is the cd for you
music	the kidz bop series is the ultimate travesty in music . and do n't think that it 's good just because your kids might love it . kids also like to eat mcdonalds , but do n't try telling me that their food is healthy . there is plenty of good music out there than is clean enough for children . and , surprisingly , a lot of these songs are very inappropriate for children , even with the expletives deleted . there is no reason on earth why these records should exist , excepting for the fact that record execs want to milk more money out of the singles once their radio play starts to diminish . i agree with the person who suggested the beatles as an alternative . seriously , do n't buy this !
music	this music is a rip off . all is borrowed to the 4 first albums of marc bolan playing under the name of tyranosaurus rex . something more bluesy here and there but nothing allowing to give any credit to this guy . a shame
music	as owner of every single chill/lounge music cd i am aware of , this was the biggest dissapointment in a long time . ultra chill series 1-4 was outstanding . while ultra chill 05 is not a complete disaster , i could not find one song worthy of a 5/5 star rating . quite a few 4 star songs and lots of 2-3 star songs . some of the better songs were repeated on older chill discs or present on other series of lounge discs . there is a lot of jazz and latin chill on these two discs , which i also like , but the jazz/world/latin chill tracks here were repeats or nothing great . i think the person that rated this 5 stars does n't own a lot of lounge/chill and is probably a lot easier to please . i 'm very dissapointed . maybe this 'genre ' is all dried up ! : ) oh well ... i 'm off to listen to `` chillout seesions 8 '' ... hopefully it will be a lot better . i highly reccomend chillout seesions by ministry of sound . chillout sessions 1-7 are outstanding ... time to go listen to the new 8 !
music	whomever decided on putting this box set together must have been smoking crack . since when did 8675309/jenny become a classic rock hit ? are you kidding me ... .come on ! no hendrix , floyd , zeppelin . classic rock my arse
music	the movie was bad and unreal and so was the soundtrack , spend your money elsewher
music	this album is essentially a fusion of great musical minds . the legendary khan payes more attention to making this a better experience for the western audiences of the sufi music by playing more with his ( brilliant ) vocal skills then with the lyrics . micheal brooks ' music stands out and enhances the experience further . this is not to say that the mainstream indo-paki audience wo n't enjoy this album ( this is one of my all time favs ) . it is fabulous background listening while doing work which may need focus - for those who need music to do such things ... : ) for those who have been thinking of testing out sufi music , this is the place to start . this is a fine introduction to the great nfak and sufi music .
music	i love this album , the best of phil collins . i believe every great artist always delivers their best stuff when they are in a rut . i know he wrote some of the songs on this album bases on his bad times/suffering with his ex wife . he did not realize how much pain she was in and the mood and moment is captured very well . he is a great composer . too bad most of his new songs ... 2006 , times are different and so is his life , i do not enjoy them as much . once an artist becomes more self-actualized much of their best work becomes just that a memory .
music	i read several different on-line reviews for this cd before i purchased it . each seemed to imply that this cd was a new direction for jaci , that her lyrics were bolder and the overall sound was much more independent in nature . strange . i must have purchsed the prozac copy of this cd because there is nothing new here from her . like my title line to this review states , it 's the exact same music she has always sang , just in a different package . now the cd just collects dust . what a shame
music	even as a joke , this would be horrible ; however , i think this band take it seriously - and it blows ! i picked up this cd because i heard a.r.e . were like a combination of suicide , front 242 , and iron maiden : interesting . no ! ! a.r.e . are a bad imitation of front 242 and watered-down liars at best . the guitar riffs are awful and the lyrics are even worse . example : `` hey world '' begins with how much it sucks to be 13 . when i saw pelican in concert , they were opening ( ? ! ? ! ? ) for a.r.e. , so i decided to give them a second chance . the sound guy must not have liked what he heard , because the bar chatter was louder . `` louder '' i yelled , so that i might find something redeeming in their music . `` yeah , suck louder ! '' someone else yelled - i had to agree give him a high-five . maybe i would have liked this when i was 12 and did n't know any better . zero stars
music	this record is a fine example of earnest juju music . other artits have tricked it up some with synths and keyboards . chief commander obe has always managed to offer more traditional representation of juju as it evolved from highlife . keep in mind , this means amazing percussion work , intertwining guitar lines , loving vocals and long well developed instrumentals . if you 're interested , you should buy it . it will make you happy , no matter how you were feeling , and what you 're doing
music	i recently decided to go through some of my old cds that i have n't listened toin ages . dj cheb i sabbah 's maha maya : shri durga remixed '' was one of those cds that i came upon . this was my first exposure to indian music , let alone world music . i was n't really familiar with music outside of western culture . so this was a new experience for me . listening to `` maha maya '' shri durga remixed '' certainly takes the listener on a trip to india with its traditional indian melodies . i envisioned myself in the taj mahal and watching a slew of belly dancers performing . the music took me awhile for the melodies to grow on me . it is certainly by no means your traditional dance remix album . i however dug transglobal underground 's version of `` kese kese '' ( where 's the sarangi mix '' right from the get go . it has a nice beat . dj cheb i sabbah did a good job at mixing and making sure that the music flowed well together . i am definitely curious to hear dj cheb 's other cds now that i have re-discovered this little gem of a cd
music	this album is one of the only live albums that i do n't have . i have heard samples , and a few extra songs on other cds though . the first thing i hear from somebody that tell about this album is basically that stevie could n't have been more high . his performance was just imbarrassing for the other members in the group ( specifically reese wynans ) . most poeple do n't know this but , on the old vinyl copy of this album , ( i 've never heard it but someone told me ) there was originally a 14th track . it was the song that usually comes close to the end of stevie 's sets . the song was life without you . since it was the very last song , i 'm guessing stevie was more pooped than ever beacause it was the last song and that he was extremely high and everything . being high is one thing , but being high and playing your last song in a set is terrible . in the old vinyl disc , stevie was on his last song and he was so terribly slow that reese wynans walked off stage embarrased and discusted . this track was taken off the album because of its discracefulness
music	the willie dixon chess set is a window into the early blues that was the basis for some of the most well known rock and roll songs of all time . from led zeppelin to the kinks willie dixon and his music was a source of inspiration and musical reinvention . sometimes you have to stay true to your roots . its an incredible journey into the heart of original blues
music	i heard stories about michelle branch before trying out her music . and i was electrified to find out that there is still a young , honest and rock-ish female artist out there working her way up . first off all , i 'd like to say i wish to remain objective to all other listeners ' opinion , so yup ... criticism is welcomed . i 'd like to let people know what kind of a viewer is writing this particular review too . basically , my main influences are bon jovi , the goo goo dolls and elo . i 'm a 17-year-old male . hotel paper is one big step for michelle . she evidentally matured her music between `` spirit room '' and this . michelle is pretty much at the state where she ca n't really make big steps on her own . and that 's why i think her authorities are limiting her potentials by pushing her to mainstream . like the fact that she wrote so many catchy , boring and good-to-sell singles that wo n't last and are only appealing to listerners on the shallow side . although some of her songs made me perfectly convinced that she can write decent music . ( tuesday morning , drop in the ocean , hotel paper ) some peeps are saying how michelle is n't quite a super songwriter nor a guitarist . i agree . imo , many of her riffs are boring and unoriginal . even a noob guitarist like me could tell . but afterall , it 's pop , so that 's inevitable . but she could do much much better than that . her lyrics are ok since she does n't write no emo nor punk junk , but a lot of complaining and childish relationships . most are ok though . what i 'm saying is , she most definetly has her own style ... but sadly , it 's surpressed at an extent where it 's irritating and makes me feel like killing those studio dudes that are spending way too much time laying their hands on michelle 's music . nevertheless , just because michelle is young and writes her own songs and plays the `` guitar '' , does n't mean you got ta try her music out . but sadly , that 's exactly how a lot of people out there got attracted . i believe it 's more about how you like the music . i ca n't stress the fact that michelle is a musician with great potential and future . but to me , it seems like she 's throwing those away for popularity . one good example is , as prolly you 've already heard ... the posing for a men 's magazine named m -- -- . whatever she was thinking , it really crushed my impressions on michelle ... the cute musical lady she used to be ... .and the terrible decision of forming a pseudo-country rock band with her friend . michelle is talented and hella good compared to the other you-know-who female artists , but let 's get real here ... she has a long way to go . she most certainly is capable of going far and i really do hope one day i 'll be listening to her matured and true music . afterall , imo , it 's only the matter of time before she surpasses amanda marshall on my list . i really hope michelle could get out of this situation and unchain from this game the studio peeps are playing on her and make every song and every note the way she always wants to . `` tuesday morning '' 3.5/5 `` hotel paper '' 4/5 the rest are just mediocre
music	do n't get me wrong with the 2 stars some songs here are really good . traffic ur adagio for strings nyana those songs are just great and the best off the album . but songs like walking on clouds sweet misery love comes again forever today can only be enjoyed so little times but they are good though . no song here is annoying in the beginning and i see a lot of 5 stars and either they are just suckers for dj tiesto or they wrote the review as soon as they got it . cause after months of having this you will see yourself skipping to songs just to hear the good stuff . dj tiesto shows he does a good job working with vocals but for a number 1 dj i expect to be hearing his stuff for a long time before getting annoying verdict : 2.8 out of 5.0 not bad for the first 20 listens but damn i could have enjoyed it much more
music	undoubtedly , marnie belongs to the top list of bernard herrmann 's best film scores , a wonderful musical image of alfred hitchcock 's underrated movie . written for small ensemble ( strings , woods , harp and horns ) herrmann gives the music a wonderfully flowing mood , tasteful and delighted along with the dark characteristics in every second bar that herrmann so masterful handles in all his works for hitch . joel mcneely 's reading is simply stunning as ever , so is the performance , but i just do n't like the overall acoustics on these varèse rerecordings with the large hall reverb giving the orchestra no room for details . they simply are overheard in this muffled sound . this is far from ideal for recording a film score and i bet herrmann would not have liked this ! but , it 's a great , great score
music	no other compilation of garland 's work exemplifies her genius and versatility than this astounding compilation that shows why she was the entertainment phenomenon that took the world by storm . all her original soundtrack performances are here , sounding magnificent . far superior to thin-sounding studio re-creations , this is the real deal , assembled with obvious skill , intelligence and dedication to the talented legend . in a sense , this should be the `` soundtrack album '' for that magnificent documentary about her that pbs produced a while back . do n't pass this up
music	i respect everyone 's opinion in here , and i 've tried so hard to love this album because i love pink floyd and i see how everyone calls it a classic . but i just do not get it . i highly overrated album imo . very childlike and underdeveloped , but maybe that is its charm ? i see 2 very different pink floyds and i have to say i never got into syd 's style . matilda this , lucifer that . the gnome ? come on . astromony domine was a classic but the rest of the album is a tough listen i 'm sorry to say . i 'm sure you 'll say a true floyd fan would love this album , well maybe that 's true . but for me , when waters and gilmour were together , that is the true floyd imo . and their reign started with meddle and ended with the wall . a brilliant 6 album run ( meddle , obc , dsotm , wywh , animals , the wall ) . for serious collectors , this is a must have and i 'll give it 2 stars , but stay away if you expect another 'wish you were here ' purchase , pre-gilmour can be a tough listen .
music	i went into this a pretty big golden smog fan eager for a new effort from the guys . with tweedy 's songwriting having taken a great upward swing in recent years and with louris ' departure from the jayhawks , i was hoping we 'd see a few more tweedy gems and some great tunes from the past few years since louris ' `` rainy day music '' was released . now , while there are some really good songs here , nothing really comes close to the `` red-headed stepchilds , '' `` radio kings , '' or `` jennifer save mes . '' the album lacks something but i ca n't put my finger on it . it almost sounds like a band that has too much focus . considering golden smog started as a buncha musician friends sitting around , drinking beer , and goofing off , this album feels wrong . it does n't have that sing-along feel ( with the exception of possibly one or two songs ) that the first couple albums ( and even ep ) had . just a little lackluster and , considering the amount of louris has his hand in on this one , almost comes off as an album of jayhawks throw-aways
music	with much anticipation we awaited the arrival of clay 's second album , thinking this one would make the career of one of our favorite singers ... and instead we fear that it is likely to end his career . while clay 's voice still sounds great , the cd is an entire collection of uninspired , underproduced remakes ... not one of which goes beyond the original . as you can see , this cd is nowhere on the billboard charts , and we 're very sad to say in our household , that it 's for good reason . save your money and buy one of the much better idol cds ... and almost any of them are , most recently kelly pickler and carrie underwood .
music	one word . generic . terrible . boring . ( well , they are all one word ) people must learn to have a better taste in music . granted there is at least one good song . a few others are decent , but only because there are no vocals . if you have heard any new band for the last 3 years , you have heard pulse ultra . my friend likes breaking binjaman ( another uber generic rock band in my book ) and he listened to 2 songs from pulse ultra and said `` thats enough '' . do yourself a favor and buy a good cd . when will people learn !
music	very disappointing - nothing like riverdance would not recommend and i am avid fa
music	i bought two copies of this sacd , both had glitches and would not play in my player correctly , be forewarned . i dont have any other problems with other sacds so i assume it is in the production somewhere . they would lock up for no reason , this is right out of the box , both copies .
music	i like jennifer lopez , but i am not a fan of j.lo ... let me explain . jennifer started her career in the mid 90s , did some promising work ( selena / out of sight / the cell / blood and wine / etc . ) , and a very well done debut album for an actor ( on the 6 ) . everything was genuinely promising . unfortunately , once `` j.lo '' was born ( circa 2001 ) , her endeavours got weak , too commercial for the sake of money , too fixed only to hype her up , not all that original nor different than anyone else , to truly stand out . `` rebirth '' is an example of that . when i heard get right for the first time , i loved it , i thought it was catchy . it harkened the days of on the 6..that sassy , groovy , r-n-b vibe she had . then i caught step into my world , the only real r-n-b track on the album and thought , i 'm feelin ' it , definitely a favorite to this day . the the rest came along ( 3-11 ) and i thought , sony j.lo made this for the sake of money , due to her films doing poorly , hence she had time off to commit to recording a new album . i thought it was a very obviously fake attempt to compensate . i think she is a great performer , a very talented person , but i honestly do n't feel this album makes her an artist , merely a reworking of herself musically . i rank it 3rd in her album line ... on the 6 ( 4 stars ) j.lo ( 3 stars ) rebirth ( 2 stars ) this is me ... then ( 2 stars )
music	1990 . it dose n't seem like that lond ago . when a barley known mariah carey stuns the world with a powerful 5 octave voice that hase n't been heard since minnie ripperton . she made her appearance when she signed on to columbia records after the now forgotten brenda k. starr , whom mariah was a backup singer for at the time , gave tommy mottola a demo tape of her songs and the rest was history . now about the album . the album starts off with her first single `` vision of love '' a powerful song that spent weeks atop the charts and made mariah a star . you can feel the suspence as mariah builds up to the bridge and gives the world their first hearing of her beautiful 5 octave voice . truly to this day , still one of her best songs . `` there 's got to be away '' changes pace from love to world issues that are still relevent today . this was released as a single in the u.k. ( it was n't released in the u.s. for fear that it would break her string of four number one hits ) yet it failed to chart . `` someday '' is the next song and was the albums third single . it too hit number one in 1991 . this song is great to hear after a breakup as mariah warns an ex-lover that `` the one you gave away will be the only one your looking for . '' this song may seem a little out dated now as it still has some heavy 80 's synth beats . `` i do n't want to cry '' was the albums fourth and , in the u.s. , the last release . it too hit number one in the summer of 1991 and within a year mariah had a whopping four number one hits under her belt . something that will not be accomplished for a long , long time . though mariah has declared her hatred for the song as she fought over the production of the song and was dissatisfied with the final product , the song still has all the work of a great mariah song and it is the only song that mariah does not hit her famous whistle register with . `` vanishing '' , though never becoming a single , is probably one of the best mariah recordings . a gospel like song with amazing vocals over a pounding piano is enough to make anyone think their in heaven . though the song is spookey enough at the chorus when she softly coos `` swiftly you 're vanishing , drifting away . '' it has also been called a `` hidden treasure '' by many reviewers . `` all in your mind '' is another song that realy showcase mariah 's vocal capabilities . though this is one of the few songs that sound dated , but definatly worth a listen . `` alone in love '' is a song that is soft and pleading would make anyone run back to mariah . truley a mariah great . the next two songs , '' you need me '' and `` sent up from above , '' really are the weakest tracks on the album and do bring down the feel of the album . they also sound dated and are not the style in which mariah is famous for . still , every mariah song is worth a listen , so go for it ! `` prisoner '' is a truley a great mariah tune . though this has a rock influence as well , she does a great job with the vocals and the lyrics stay insode your head . this almost became a single in the u.s. but mariah finished her new album quicker than originaly planned . `` love takes time '' truly will have a place in my heart . every time i hear this song it takes me back to 1990 , almost like a little time machine . putting this song on her first record almost did n't happen , as mariah har intended it to be on her next record . though tommy mottola and other executives persuaded her to . the style is not that different than `` vision of love , '' where it build untill the brige where mariah lets off her signature high note . this was also the second single of the album and became her second number one in late 1990 . though music box , daydream , and the emancipation of mimi would go onto break records and are considered some of mariah 's best albums , there is no way you can leave this one out . this album truley is the one that started it all . to this date it has gone 9x platinum and made carey into a star and would be the start of years and years of great music from the voice of this generation . though this album was heavily criticized for being to similar and formulaic to paula abdul , janet jackson , and especially whitney houston , it still ranks as one of the best albums of the 90 's and of all time . for some people this album may be a time capsule of 1990 and for others who are now expiriencing this music for the first time one fact will always be true . this is one of the best debuts and albums ever and was the start of a simple long island girl named mariah carey , who became a superstar .
music	what can i say that most of the people reviewing this cd have n't already said . arthur is outrageously talented . it 's almost shocking . the depth of songwriting and production values are so intense . it 's extremely well recorded and mixed music . anyone into audio manipulation should just buy all of his albums right now . `` stumble and pain '' is probably my favourite track . the sinister tone of it and the synth effects are just superb . as with all arthur albums the vocals are dense , layered , and its something he 's obviously worked on for a long time and it really pays off on this album ! anyone new to him should buy this immediatly and buy redemption 's son straight after that . what a musician
music	the bloodshot gang knows how to have a good time ! if you 're into the whole alt.country thing , you know that some of it is very sincere and serious ( ie , uncle tupelo , jayhawks ) . now i love `` no depression , '' and `` blue earth , '' but this is an altogether different quadrant of alternative country known as militant honky tonk , or just insurgent country . truth be told , this incredible anniversary compilation does have some poignant , serious numbers ( rico bell 's `` money to burn , '' the texas rubies ' `` blue diamond mine , '' mike ireland 's `` i 'd like to '' ) , but for the most part these maniacs are not taking themselves or the world that seriously . you 've got andre williams and sally timms singing `` i 'll stick to you like glue ... '' , in mock romantic seriousness with background singers going `` g-l-e-u , glue ! '' you 've got a song with a man and a woman serenading each other saying with deep country feeling how much they miss each other 's bodies . you 've got kim docter and moonshine willy belting out `` turn the lights down low , '' which really ought to be a hit it 's so catchy . and you 've got some great deadpan covers -- the waco brothers do a country rave-up of the who 's baba o'riley , '' red star belgrade does it to ac/dc 's `` highway to hell , '' and best of all , the unholy trio turns public enemy 's `` bring the noise '' into an understated redneck anthem . i 'm only scratching the surface here , with 40 tracks over 2 discs . this is a great introduction to the rowdier side of that sprawling beast that has not a name that can be agreed on ... and do n't miss the fantastic earlier bloodshot compilation , hell-bent ( insurgent country , volume ii ) -- see my 9/5/04 review
music	edited : it took me a while to enjoy listening to this whole album since i am used to listening to her recent work - afterglow surfacing . this is truly an outstanding album and definitely overlooked . in my opinion , this ranks as the 3rd best sarah mclachlan album with # 1 fumbling towards ecstasy , and # 2 afterglow -- even though surfacing outsold these 2 albums . i ca n't say much about the album , because some of the reviews here say what i would say for this album as well . drawn to the rhythm : 5/5 into the fire : 5/5 the path of thorns ( terms ) : 5/5 - first song from solace i heard . truly unique than the rest since she sings at a lower range . i will not forget you : 5+/5 - love it , my # 1 favorite of all her songs on this album . lost : 4.5/5 ( this is a first for sarah mclachlan to have male background singers singing - edited : actually this would be the third as her 1st album `` touch '' had male bg singers for the tracks trust and strange world ) back door man : 5/5 - i truly enjoy this song , this song sort of reminds me of stupid from afterglow . i love her intense voice and wish she could do more songs like this . shelter : 5/5 - really sad and it 's actually the second solace song i heard after 'path ' black : 5+/5 - this is my second favorite song . all in all , deep lyrics dedicated to corporate pigs as sarah says . one of her first experimental songs after `` touch '' . home : 5/5 - this is also another good song , probably the 3rd i love . i just love how the song ends . it actually sounds better live since the instruments overlap her singing . mercy : 5/5 - i consider this the last song from the album . wyllh does n't do it for me and i 'm disappointed sarah let arista have it their way . oh well . sarah should do more acapella-like songs ! this truly displayed her skills and got even better in the next album ; ) overall rating : 9.5/10 outstanding album i wish it had more praise
music	dj quik ( the best producer ever ) did all the tracks in this one with help from robert bacon on some tracks . this album is just classic nuthin more to it !
music	most of these idiot reviewers are missing the fact that this cd is missing lot of songs which define extreme . the implication that it is a `` best of '' and not a `` greatest hits '' should have included more from their self-titled album . tsk-tsk , this does n't include `` mutha ( do n't wan na go to school today ) '' , how can that be
music	simon & amp ; garfunle wrote a lot of forgettible music ( most notably for the film the graduate , which would have been a better film without thier dated msuic ) . this cd dates very badly as all thier music does , it 's got a very limited appeal , only for diehard fans , but beware thsi music really sounds dated , i mean it 's really unlistenable
music	i found the music rather annoying . it was not what i expected at all
music	mostly bland , by this time it seemed that bad was dead in the water , nothing here matches the excitement of this is . especially annoying are `sightsee mc ! ' , `ice cool killer ' and `the big v ' . bad goes rap ? no thanks . it 's easy to see why they did the whole bad 2 thing . buy the globe instead
music	i was looking to get the dvd of dazed and confused but got the cd . when it was advertised on the amazon website it led me to believe that it was a dvd as you see it above . ( 1993 film ) i had to return it and my expense . very disappointing transaction with amazon . threfore , i am not impressed
music	( with the possible exception of klemperer 's fidelio . ) i am deeply comforted to see from other reviews that others are finally getting the message . as mr clinton 's campaign team would say , `` it 's the singing , stupid '' . do *not* be mislead by the starry names , this thing barks and yowls like new year 's eve in the cats-and-dogs home . do not pass go , do not waste $ 35 , go directly to josef krips on decca legends for three discs of perfect joy
music	another solid 70 's band that faded into obscurity . the nice thing about living in canada was that we got to see all of the minor as well as the major acts . edward bear fell between the two . the original members got together in the late sixties and took their name from a more famous bear named winnie . all of their hits are here as well as a cover of `` freedom for the stallion '' , a song that was also covered by `` the hues corporation '' and popularized by `` three dog night '' . its mostly the type of music that most will remember a favourite love by from `` the last song '' to `` close your eyes '' ( i 'm back again ) . a good middle of the road pop album to melt back the years
music	this album is ridiculous . i almost want to say part of srv 's soul is in this guy ... he is that good . honestly i think this album rips apart his previous two . my hope is that jimmy , dt and apo will bring out a 4th release ... as good as this album or better ! this is one of those great albums where every song is good . buy it . you like srv , buy it . double trouble must have brought part of srv back , because this album is just plain sweet
music	sounds like it should be in a meg ryan romantic comedy . did they intentionally try to erase his personality ? sounds like it was produced in nashville ! this should be a demo for another singer to record . it 's just too schmaltzy for me . i think phil ramone may be slipping too . billy is a much better singer than this . after listening to this song i instinctively lit a match . i 'm going to go listen to glass houses
music	my 8 year old daughter was very dissappointed after receiving this cd for christmas . it is advertised as the cheetah girls 2 - however these vocals are not sung by the original cheetah girls who are in the movie . the songs just do n't sound the same . it 's very dissappointing that disney does n't tell you this on the cd
music	as others have noted , this was a time of turmoil for the group . now trimmed back to a fourpiece ( they had just lost guitarist/singer bob weston and singer dave walker ) , they also changed producers after 5 straight albums they had either self-produced or collaborated with martin birch on . this cd also leans really heavily on material from bob welch ( this would be his last release with the band ) and it suffers deeply for that . most of the few highlights here are furnished by christine mcvie . the title cut is a nice lament about male prevarication . the understated `` prove your love '' is also a winner . of the welch contributions , the only real standouts are the mystical `` bermuda triangle '' and gentle closer `` safe harbour '' . there are plenty of miscues , filler , and outright bad material here . mcvie 's `` come a little bit closer '' is produced like it wants to be a hit , but it 's much too slight to stick in the memory . welch 's `` she 's changing me '' sounds like chicago colliding with the mac ... the horns do n't work here . the handclap bridge in `` silver heels '' seems too poppy and out of place in the context of the rest of the tune , which is execrable anyway . the silver lining to this disc is that what might have been a death knell turned into the band 's finest hour just one album later..
music	gene watson was one of the finest voices in country music , and this compilation of 18 hits provide a fine sampling of that voice . considered by some to be `` hard country '' , i find gene watson to have a more `` pop '' oriented voice that combined well with his selection of songs ; and in the '70 's , that proved to be enough to keep him on the charts . while many of the songs on this album are pure country , others are the typical , drab , 70 's pop that filled the void between the nashville sound and the new traditional era of the 80 's . in any case , there is no doubt that gene watson earned his spot in country music , and this collection carries those hits that made him the household name he is today ; including his signature songs `` farewell party '' and `` love in the hot afternoon '' . if you prefer the more traditional country sound , his `` you could know as much about a stranger '' and `` should i come home '' are also included
music	`` modern '' usually sounds like some outdated mid-80s new wave album by the cars , flock of seagulls , or somesuch . it is not a punk record , mostly midtempo pop . the three songs diggle wrote and sings on are basically awful ; shelley 's are considerably better - the usual wry lyrics and great hooks . i would say about 3 or 4 of the tunes are topnotch buzzcocks stuff ; newbies should buy `` operator 's manual '' or `` going steady . '' or dig up the amazing `` different kind of tension '' from a used record store somewhere ! also , see them live if you have a chance
music	i agree fully with `` a music fan '' above ... this and david 's self titled album are really poor in comparison to the rest of his solo work . i love most of talking heads music but do n't rate remain in light highly like most fans do
music	ignore the big word `` karaoke '' on the cover and the microphone shown , this is just a music cd , it does not display anything in a karaoke player
music	i am at a loss to hear what people appreciate about this cd . we were barely able to make it through one listening . this is a classic example of a cd that never would have been produced had the artist ( using the term very loosely ) not already been famous for something besides music . the lack of talent and originality on this cd is apalling . it only gets a star because that 's the lowest rating . i want my money back
music	i am a huge fan of thomas newman but really this cd presents nothing new . it comes across as merely a re-hash of the airy , atmospheric , melody-free cues from his other recent scores . it has none of the originality of american beauty or road to perdition . frankly , as much as i like his scores , i do n't think this warranted a cd release , it 's just got too bland and ordinary , no matter how beautifully constructed and pristine it all sounds . a pity
music	after really enjoying the amici forever album , i went shopping for another amici album and found this one . there really is no comparison between the two . i 've tried listening to it several times to see if i 'm missing something , but somehow the selections and arrangements seem more appropriate for the lawrence welk generation than anyone interested in a spicy little opera troupe . i was very disappointed
music	wow ! tom morello , flea , pete yorn , chris cornell , brad wilk , maynard james keenan . when i first heard of this superstar line-up , i was sure that this cd was going to be awesome . i was duped like everyone else who bought this album . axis of justice ( or so cleverly put by a previous reviewer as `` axis of jackasses '' ) is really a bad album , even for a bunch of political liberal rockers . serj and tom really dropped the ball with this one . what could 've been a festoon of awesomeness turned out to crap-fest of whiny musicians with an equally crappy message . knowledge , the night watchmen , and ahmed ahmed are among the many reasons why this is so bad and incredibly difficult to listen to . the song , '' jeffrey , are you listenng ? '' is up there with other crappy songs like john mayer 's `` city love '' and richard harris ' `` macarthur park . '' on top of all that , the communist entertainer known as michael moore adds his little nugget of wisdom on the dvd , which i can say i 've become dumber now that i 've listened to it . for the love of all good music , stay far away from this cd
music	`` burnin ' '' was the last album by the wailers as a collective group , afterwhich peter tosh and bunny wailer left the group to pursue solo careers and marley reformed his group , calling it `` bob marley the wailers '' in 1974 . the album shows the original three at their best , balancing lead vocals on several songs between bob marley , bunny wailer , and peter tosh . the album not only serves to further reveal bob 's soon-to-be legendary work , but also to show the talent of bunny wailer with his lead vocals on songs like `` hallelujah time '' and `` pass it on '' . the album also shows tosh taking lead with marley on `` one foundation '' and alongside marley on `` get up , stand up '' . the album 's biggest gem , however , was `` i shot the sheriff , '' soon to be made a favorite in the u.s. and the u.k. by rock artist eric clapton on his 1974 `` 451 ocean boulevard '' album . the deluxe edition also features a concert from the tour in leeds , u.k. just one week before the wailers broke up . ( bunny , however , was already absent , having refused to tour outside of jamaica once and for all earlier that year . his temporary replacement , the wailers ' old vocal coach , joe higgs was also absent , quitting the tour after they completed their shows in the u.s. ) 1973 's `` burnin ' '' shows the original wailers at their very best before their breakup and is a timeless classic for music fans everywhere , i can guarentee it
music	i bought this for my kids because i knew they would love these songs just as i did . forget them ! i love it ! there is nothing like the chipmunks and never will be again . the christmas song is worth the price alone . do n't think about it . just get it
music	this is roxys last gasp ... i mean `` wheres eddie jobson ? ? '' actually this really a good recording , its just that the first 5 roxy music albums were so flawlessly perfect that its hard to stand up against that level of perfection ... anyway..with that said ... i have no idea why they took off the great rock version and put the disco-fluff version of angel eyes , which is hard to find on cd . this , to me is really the last roxy music album , because you just cant have roxy music without paul thompson ... sorry . i mean avalon and the others are nice pieces , but they really should have been bryan ferry solo albums because andy and phil are really playing more as session players there
music	i liked the santana - steven tyler song/video . since i found out about the sneaky root kit this software installs and the idea of no free use of something i buy within reasonable means - i wont buy the cd . want to make sure that sony loses money in this effort - will teach them a lesson . i have been burned by sony 's proprietary [ ... ] before on other items , so i will stay away .
music	even if you do n't know much about donny hathaway , this collection of songs is a fun mix and it 's very moving . it includes some classics with roberta flack that are terrific . i enjoy it tremendously
music	this is one of my all-time favorite cds . i loved all the songs on this cd except one . my favorite is `` black girl pain '' and it should be an anthem and inspriration for black women all over the globe . i had the pleasure of seeing talib in concert a few months ago in atlanta and his live show was even better than his cd . true hip-hop lives
music	incredible follow up to rated r which i did n't think could be equaled and they did . flat out incredible songwriting , amazing vocal identity and muscianship at its best . if you grew up in the 70 's as i did and miss those albums that you would play constantly from beginning to end then this album is for you . `` go with the flow '' is one of the greatest rock singles of all time but you wo n't be skipping any songs on this disc . baby boomers rejoice , rock is back
music	tunisian anouar brahem 's `` le voyage de sahar '' finds him in the same company- pianist francis courturier and accordionist jean-louis martinier- as 2002 's highly acclaimed `` le pas du chat noir . '' having toured in support of that cd , the trio developed into a true group , something that brahem accentuates to great effect on this program of new compositions and three favorites that are recast with the new ensemble . with `` voyage '' brahem continues a trend of creating music that is not as overtly `` jazzy '' as some of his earlier outings . nonetheless , he remains a master a crafting deliciously vivid , richly evocative compositions that distill arabic music and european jazz sensibilities with a warm , sonorous chamber music vibe . among the ports of call on this `` voyage '' are `` zarabanda , '' whose elegant lope recalls the french riviera . elsewhere the title track exudes mysticism tempered with intrigue , while `` cordoba '' and `` ete andalous '' are meditative pieces with a decidedly cinematic scope . the gentle bounce of `` nuba '' and introspection of `` les jardins de ziryab '' both include uncredited but effective passages of voice . rarely do you hear music this gorgeous
music	i remember listening to this years ago , and i thought i would add this to my cd library , now i know why it has been years sense i 've listened to it , , very sqeaky , dull , slow paced stuff , bob segar makes this stuff sound like tin foil..
music	spice 1 's just different from every other rapper . and he 's awesome . if you love hardcore rap , you 'll love spice 1
music	i finally got this cd , i have been looking for this cd for awhile now , a great by well worth it
music	this is an amazing cd - i can not believe that more people have not discovered charlie sexton . the songs are personal and beautifully written . the music rocks , and yet it 's different than any of sexton 's other music . he is a brilliant artist and this is a brilliant wor
music	the first four albums are so unbelievably great that for me it 's almost impossible to say one is better that the others . taken together , they are almost like one long album . the family that plays together shows the band turning a slightly more commercial corner without sacraficing any of their artistic integrity . their blending of styles is a bit mote intergrated than on the first . randy california 's influence on the music was becoming stronger as well . one thing that differd spirit from most of their comtempories was the strength with whch they were able to convey their songs in concert . i saw the original version 11 times and they never failed to astound me . it 's a shame that the only legitimate live recordings of the band are of the later ed cassidy/randy california version . not that the later versions of the band were n't great - they just were n't quite as good as the original band . if your'e just being introduced to spirit , the family that plays together is a fine place to start
music	yes yes we all know the mega hit when i see you smile . but it would be unfair to put this album into the one hit wonder basket and instead review it as a whole . the band hits gear pretty early with best of what i got but after that it 's pretty bad . how possession ever became a hit i 've not idea . well , where i come from it did n't , but in the us this mob had a string of soppy power ballad hits . the production is good but the fire goes out for most of the album . neil schon is a great guitarist but it was the late 80 's and the guy obviously knew what he had to do for a decent paycheck . besides , he probably wanted some revenge on steve perry so he really wanted to make some cash . pity , listen to some of the guitar licks here and there is a decent hard rock album in the man . rockin ' horse for example . an interesting additin to the aor landscape , and some of the music is lively . but when the whole thing has as much heft as a lettuce leaf it just does n't get my vote . even my devoted aor fan girlfriend of the time only liked the one track ( we all know which one ) . but hey , if aor is your bag you could do a lot worse
music	i bought this out of a cut rack for $ 3.99 . it sat in my cd tower for at least 5 years before i ever really listened to it.i could n't stand the way it sounded over my stereo and i came close to trading it.i brought it to work and put my headphones on and it sounds like a completely different album.i really like the whole experience . i 'm lucky i brought it up here-it was going nowhere at home but i 'm playing it a couple of times a day over my headphones . i do n't know anything about this band , i bought it on a whim , but i 'd reccommend this album and i may follow up on this band
music	i love these albums . get all 3 cause they are great
music	i love almost all of these songs on this cd . if you want songs that grab your every emotion ... this cd is for you ! i also recommend their other cds also
music	there are only a couple of songs i did like on this cd . i did enjoy ice cube and aaliyah , but the rest of the cd left me cold . i do think that if you can just find the two songs and pay to download them , it would have been better ! i suggest borrowing first from a friend and seeing if you actually like it first before you buy .
music	i had high hopes for this cd . i love norwegian metal , and i love viking stuff so i thought this would be great . i was at least hoping it would be good . what i heard was a bunch of uninspired , mediocre , a dime a dozen metal songs . i mean there is enough good to save it from being a total waste , but not enough to give it even 3 stars . the high points are the fate of norns , the persuit of vikings , and arson . these songs are bad @ $ $ and fun to listen too . an ancient sign of coming storm 5.5 just mediocre where death seems to dwell 5.5 very repetitive the fate of norns 7 this one is pretty good . it has a repetitive punchy opening riff that gets stuck in your head long after listening to it . the pursuit of vikings 7.5 this is my favorite song from this cd . pretty bad a $ $ . valkyries ride 5.5 tedious monotony the beheading of a king 5.5 same as valkryies arson 7.5 a bit of a slow starter but it picks up towards the end with some melodic guitar once sealed in blood 5.5 a bit faster than some but still a downer . all in all nothing horrible , and there is some good songs . the music is a little on the simple side which doesnt necasarily make it bad . i like a lot of simpler music like darkthrone and burzum . the problem is that when it comes to simpler stuff i like it to have some really good aptmosphere . that is precisly what is lacking here . i will still listen to it occasionally hoping that it will grow .
toys	my 2 year old loves it ... though one set of grandparents ca n't stand the noise so if you do n't like noisy toys - obviously this is n't one for you . otherwise its great ! runs out of battery very quickly though .
toys	like many others , the arm on my 4 year olds excavator broke as well who can we contact for help ? there is no information on the box
toys	if you want a beautiful asian doll , i just found a couple in ebay under `` asian berenguer girl doll `` . the one i got on ebay was gorgerous ! ! ! my daughter loves it and wo n't leave home without it .
toys	everyone in the children 's room at the avon library loves the gazillion bubble machine . it is used frequently during story hours and captures all the chidren 's attention . it 's not necessarily educational but is alot of fun
toys	we got this for our son for easter , and he was playing with donnie the dumptruck , and the handle part was opened , so it was the flat blue portion of the truck , well he some how slipped , and ended up cutting his forehead b/c the blue portion does have somewhat of a sharp part . luckily enough it was n't where he needed stitches , but still ... so i called little tikes , and they said they wanted me to mail it back and they let me choose another toy-so there customer service at little tikes is definitly a + ! just watch out because i think the ages on this toy should be a little older . semper f
toys	the seller shipped promptly but the merchandise disappointed ... materials/workmanship not so hot ; my husband stuck his hand all the way through a side panel while setting it up . since there was no taking it back from our 2-year-old after he saw it , he now has a tent with an extra window in it . child is delighted with the toy , parent is not delighted with durability
toys	my daughter really wanted this for christmas . she really has played and played with it ever since . i wish that it came with some dry erase markers for the board in it but other than that we have been very pleased with the product
toys	i purchased the game to play at a christmas party . it was a lot of fun . thank yo
toys	i stumbled upon this game years ago , and my family has enjoyed it -- even my adult friends , who seemed to balk at first at playing a kids ' game . this past year , i decided to purchase it for my sixth grade classroom . i must say ... wow . i allowed the kids to play it for a while during homeroom , and kids would be waiting early outside the room to get in and snag the frog juice . they would even play it over other outdoor games at recess . anytime you heard a `` noooo ! '' in the room , you knew someone had pulled out the witch wash . the kids loved it . so , i have come back to purchase a new deck for this upcoming year . to any educators who might be reading this , it makes a great addition to the intermediate classroom for those few minutes of downtime , and because of the math and bit of strategy involved , you do n't feel guilty about it at all . plus , it is something different and for the teacher , inexpensive as far as games go
toys	since purchasing this `` executive '' set , i have purchased another one at a local store . although both sets are relatively the same , the instruction package with my second set is much better . the sea monkeys in the `` executive '' set lasted about a month and a half . this was due to the fact that the instructions on how to care for them were very vague . we did not know that you needed to add air to the water or that over feeding was extremely bad for them . the instructions in the sea monkey set we bought locally were very good and we have now had sea monkeys for over 3 months . i believe the `` executive '' set is overpriced as well
toys	our entire family loved the hand held game , as a matter of fact we ended up buying 5 of them total eveyone wanted one . i would highly recommend this item to everyon
toys	well , now this carry case is a goner . the latch will no longer close and the top rim is hopelessly bent . it was fun while it lasted
toys	this is great ! no more lost cartridges or torn books . very easy for my four year old to store all her leap pad items
toys	this product was exactly what i was looking for . i recieved it in a timely manner and the merchant communicated kindly and proactively with me about the shipment . thanks
toys	i bought this sippy cup seeing how informative the review was.. and i was happy when i saw it and my baby liked it.. but whn i went to wash it , i cleaned the valve , by removin a obvious piece that had to be removed to clean ... and it never was able to attach corrctly it will fall in her drink and completely get my babys face all wet so after one use i had to discard it ... maybe it was defected but i was not satisfied with it
toys	i especially like this product for traveling and sitting in waiting rooms . my only complaint is that you have to hold it just right to see the puzzle clearly on the screen . it has a contrast adjustment , but it not very helpful . it also has a lighted screen option which is not very good either . a great improvement would be a screen with greater contrast .
toys	my son loves to `` drive '' cars . i saw this and thought he would love it . it is totally unrealistic , doesnt make much noise ( which for some parents that would be a + , but in this case its not ) and it is not entertaining at all . paid entirely tooooo much money for something that he will not play with at all . i have tried letting some of my friends children play with it , and they dont seem to enjoy it either .
toys	if you are not a literature professor or do n't read everything that the library gets in , you will probably find this game extremely difficult . on the other hand , you now have a book list
toys	i bought this shopping cart for my 14 month old daughter who absolutely loves her little mommy doll . she enjoyed taking the food out of the shopping cart but when she tried putting it back in the basket fell off the frame and she got quite upset . also , at her age it is difficult to get the doll into the seat portion without assistance from mom . the cart itself also does not turn well when tried to walk with it
toys	i always thought clue looked like a complicated game i 'd never touch ! that is until i played it at my friends house ! now i 'm a clue fanatic trying to collect all the versions ! this game can never get old because it 's a different outcome every time ! i strongly reccomend it to anyone 8 and older
toys	we just got this for my daughter 's 5th birthday . this toy was what received the greatest excitement . while opening presents , my daughter exclaimed at the the top of her lungs , `` i got a brietta pegasus ! '' the pegasus itself is durable , beautiful , and creatively sparks hours of imaginitave play . i did n't think it was a big deal trying to get it out of the box . many toys are packaged that way these days ... perhaps an anti-theft plan . i just got some scissors and brietta was out to play . so far we also have n't had any trouble with the wings . if they do fall out occasionally- they pop right back in . a small price to pay for such a well-loved toy that my 5 year old plays with for hours . as a mom who also loved unicorns and pegasus ponies as a girl , i 'm glad i can give that magic to my own girls
toys	i love melissa and doug toys , they 're always well-made and always thoughtful . they encourage learning and their pieces , made of natural material , not only hold up well but are environmentally friendly . this game is a particularly nice example . it 's a classic wooden puzzle with a twist . each vehicle puzzle piece has a magnet on it and the players yank them out with a magnetic `` tow truck '' . melissa and doug have made two other puzzles similar to this , a fish puzzle and a butterfly puzzle , with the same concept . this one , however , might appeal more to kids whose current fascinations lie more along the lines of cars and trucks . one of our pieces ( on the fishing version of this puzzle ) did stick , but a quick rub around the edges with some sandpaper loosened it right up . the downside of using real materials is that wood does have a tendency to warp in humidity or dryness . that 's a downside i 'm willing to live with ! excellent toy !
toys	this item is nothing like picture poorly made i could have made a better one myself out of old pillow cases.not worth the money avoid this item
toys	this is a great , simple , fast game that is fun for all ages
toys	i bought this for my grandson , and he no sooner got it out of the box ( with help ) , and he was outside in the sand with it , having a great time . can not lose with these oversized trucks for little hands . it is a good purchase
toys	this is a very handy product to have around for our 3-year old if the batteries happen to die while traveling . the ac adapter is a life-saver for long car trips . just as an aside note , the adapter does not look like the one in the picture . it is gray-and-orange , like the adapters you seen in the store
toys	we purchased this game for our son for christmas . he is a chess lover , and we wanted to get him something a little different . chaturanga was perfect , since it is the precursor to chess . he has enjoyed the game . all of us were impressed with the bookshelf edition . it is an attractive box . we are very pleased with every aspect of it
toys	we love this game . we were first introduced to it at our children 's preschool where it fast became a favorite at `` free choice time '' . the children engaged in it delightfully and playfully . everyone has fun . the game board is durable and can be constructed differently over and over again -- this works out so great because with all the repeated play ours gets the kids are not memorizing the spot the item was . i worried a little that it might be too competitive and those that were `` better '' at it might leave those not as quick at hunting feeling discouraged , but have not ever found that to be the case when we have the game out at home or at the school . the board is brightly colored the items are fascinatingly fun to search for . it is a challenge even for us big kids . i would recommend it highly for a fun family activity game
toys	a `` jewelry box '' for your little girls polly pocket accessories . my daughter received this as a gift for christmas and loved it ! would be perfect if it was just a little bigger but is definitely worth the money
toys	we recently purchased this playhouse , and discovered that it does not come with the peek-a-boo shutters ( i do n't see the shutters in the photo either although they are mentioned in the product description ) . our 3year old and 18 month old both enjoy it , but i would say it is more fun for the 18 month old than my 3 year old since there is little to actually `` do '' inside the house . the doorbell makes fun sounds . it is very easy to put together
toys	my daughters love this supermarket checkout ! they 've had it for a few months and have n't lost interest . i would recommend it for any child who likes to play pretend . the quality is what i expected ... works fine
toys	i could n't wait to get this for my 18 month daughter . much to my disappointment , i get it and it does n't work . i returned it and received a replacement . that one also did n't work . i am in the process of returning it and wo n't ever buy from amazon.com again
toys	this thing took about 6 hours to build . the directions are terrible and extremely difficult to follow , but i figured it was worth it because it just looks so cool . unfortunately after completely assembling the thing and flipping the switch the motor , on fresh batteries , did n't have enough power to lift the ball the almost 6 feet consistently . we spent as much time trying to get the motor to do what it was supposed to as we did building it . ours also came with a special ball that had a skateboarder inside . he looks really cool , but the motor never was able to lift him more than about a foot . i love knex , but this set is a dud
toys	i bought this mostly for the container . i had individual play-doh products , like the barber set that came in it 's own box . i 'm able to put all play-doh things into this container and everything is in one spot . no more boxes and sorting . i even still have space for more things like different colors and everything . my daughter loves the variety of the toys and i love the convenience . i 'm going to buy it for presents for other families i know !
toys	i was very pleased with this product , it covered the back seat and has a handy little pocket to put bottles , wipes , dipers in . i have brought another two for the other car
toys	i bought two bionicles for my son 's stocking at christmas . he is 5 so i had to help him put them together . it took forever to construct this sad little robot and within minutes of playing with it , it began to fall apart . the instructions are not clear and the overall durability just stinks . if your child just wants to construct them and display them , then this is great . if your child wants to play with them , forget it . go buy a preassembled action figure and move on with your life
toys	i ca n't put it any better than the others before me have . i did a lot of research before purchasing this train and am so glad i decided to spend a little bit more money for a ton more quality . this is truly an heirloom train set that will be around longer than i will be ( and i 'm only 35 ) . the other reviewers are also correct in advising that you shop around before purchasing this train set . the prices vary wildly . yes , it hurts a little to spend this kind of money on a train set when you know there are others out there . however , the others are cheaper for a reason ... they 're junk . you simply ca n't do better than this set
toys	worst product ever . i really trust crayola , but am having doubts after these new outdoor products . theyre just terrible- made shotty- they dont work.. i am very disappointed . this spins so fast that none of the paint comes out- then it just pours out in a big wet mess . just awful
toys	i 've owned this toy for a few weeks and have given up on it . at first this toy was a little fun and i was optimistic about getting it to handle correctly . i 'd adjust the top screw to trim it from spinning clockwise or counter clockwise and everything . this gets old after doing it every time after a charge . next , using the forward and backward control does n't work that well . also , it will drop out of the sky or do something weird every now and then . all in all i would n't buy it again , especially at the higher price it is currently going for . try the smaller havoc , it seems to handle a little better ( youtube has a few movies of it flying ) . [ ... ]
toys	got a very similar model at a babies r us several months ago , but without the adult 's handle . my son is almost 2 and can almost pedal by himself , and we generally like the style , but the trike tips so easily that i rarely take it out for him to use . never would have thought to check this but i 'll be in the market for a big-wheel type trike or one that is much more stable than this model .
toys	if you 're a fan of the evil child-killer mr. fred krueger , then add this item to your collection as well . you can always trust neca to provide with great horror movie replicas . the figure is based on his latest entry ; freddy vs jason
toys	we got this toy for my son when he was 2 1/2 years old he is now 4 years old . it still runs like new . he drives it like a champ . we have used it to haul mulch to the back yard and some yard bricks . it never fails us and he think he is a big helper which he is . i am thinking of buying a 2nd one for my younger son now .
toys	this tor breakes when you build tall buildings , but i made a mouse out of them . when the magnets are pushed back that makes me angry , but you can make people by just putting four magnets on one ball , but in all i say you shuld decide yourself .
toys	i received this ty pig as a baby shower gift . my son `` discovered '' it when he was 18 months old and it 's his dearest companion besides his `` night-night . '' piggy must go for car rides , eat with him , get jammies on and go to the dr. to have his temperature checked . we love piggy because when he 's covered with milky cheerios , we can just throw him in the washer and dryer . he 's good as new in about an hour . who would n't love that ? it 's also a great toy for allergy sufferers because it can be thoroughly cleaned regularly to remove dust mites . we love it and my son loves it . now we ordered a spare piggy so that there is a piggy substitute when piggy is bathing . enjoy your toddler
toys	it is a magnificient item ! so simple and beautiful yet full of really small details and `` hello , here is johnny cash ! '' looks really great on foot with his guitar . just like real . i strongly recommend it to all cash fans
toys	after reading other reviews , i , too , purchased this to use to practice agility with our dog . i was n't sure it would be large enough . she is an english setter . it works perfectly for this size of dog . she is approx . 35 lbs , med . size dog . cind
toys	i thought this would be a great addition to our tub toy collection , i was wrong . it does n't work ! ! ! ! we tried shampoo and baby wash in it and there was no `` mountain of bubbles '' . this product does n't work , save your money ! !
toys	i was very dissapointed with the product , it was displayed as something that was simple to use and fun for all ages ... .i ordered 4 of them for my grandchildren and when they opened them for christmas , we found that they were `` clumsy '' to use , the sound quality is poor at best , and they are made of hard plastic which is not particularly safe to be `` whacking '' on anything and everything as i was led to believe . we are a musical family and therefore more inclined to try to produce music from various sources , but i am afraid this is not worth the money . if i had opened them before christmas i would have returned them , but it was too late so now they are stuck with them
toys	i got this for the price , $ 4.99 . i put it together 2 days ago and my 4 year old daughter has spent almost every waking hour playing with it . the first thing she asks me in the morning : `` will you play mermadia with me mommy ? pretty please ? '' the parts come off easily but do not fall off . my daughter is a little rough on her toys but since the pieces of this are easily taken apart and put back together it is great for her . she loves it .
toys	toby is one of the regulars on the thomas his friends tv series , and this little wooden tram engine is well-made and durable for those who have the wooden railway sets . my only complaint - and this is very minor - is that toby is a bit taller than other wooden thomas engines , meaning that he can not fit under bridges very well
toys	this toy seemed like a fun idea , however it is utter chaos . the toy moves randomly over the page and does not make any sort of comprehensive design . actually our table received more ink than the paper and then the kids could not get it to turn off . i think it may be slightly posessed !
toys	i bought this toy for my daughter almost a year ago now . she still plays with it all the time . it is by far her fav toy . the only problem is that it 's a bit too load and no way to turn it down , or off . well , besides that it is a perfect toy for small kids . my daughter is almost 4 and still is not tired of it
toys	this toy is fantastic . although i have the english speaking toy , it still has a similar sounding italian accent to the toy . if you enjoyed the films , i highly recommend these toys ! ! ! is it possible to buy an italian speaking luigi
toys	i bought this puzzle for my kid after he solved the original cube . i had read the review here and other places stating that one needed to be cautious when turning the puzzle . however , our major problem with it was that the orange stickers ( within ten minutes of playing with the cube ) began to peel back and fall off . we tried using glue ( they had no stick to them ) to put them back but it was not long after that the green stickers began curling back and falling off as well . the major problem is that these turned out not to be `` stickers '' after all , but rather colored squares of vinyl adhereing to additional stickers beneath ( all white ) by means of static . they fall off easily . this is a nice puzzle for show ( impressive on the desk ) but not for actual continued use . hopefully , rubik 's can use proper stickers or adhesive in the future and maybe even tighten up the design so that this can be used as a fun puzzle
toys	like others said the microphone stand broke very easily and the whole toy is not durable at all . the legs and the stool do not stay together whatsoever . my son has to sit with it on his lap to play it . i would not recommend this toy to anyone
toys	the beads and charms are nice enough , but for the price you get very little with this kit -- only about 50 tiny glass beads and 50 spacers , plus the charms . there 's nothing here special enough to justify spending the money -- there are plenty of nicer jewelry kits out there that are more generous with the supplies
toys	when putting together the mobile section of this item , i was very disappointed in its flimsiness . it looks like just a few knocks will cause the screws to break from the plastic . when i turned it on i was disappointed a second time , this time by the irritating buzzing sound that the mobile makes as it rotates . it 's so loud you ca n't hear the music , which is a shame because i 'm sure my son would enjoy looking at the moving lights . the third disappointment - the buttons are very hit-and-miss . sometimes the music buttons do n't work ( the lullaby one worked eventually once i mashed it in really hard ) . that i could live with , but it 's fiddling with the other controls that is really irritating . control for music off , lights on/off and rotation on/off all seem to be tied up in two buttons . if you have the music and lights going , then turn on the rotation , the music and lights will go off as the rotation comes on . then you have to press buttons in whatever order seems logical until you get them all going the way you want them . please bear in mind i am not particularly daft - i managed to figure out my tivo remote in a day or so - but the controls for this baby 's musical mobile make no sense to me . i thought at first it was supposed to be deliberately challenging in order to stimulate 'baby 's natural curiosity ' , but after two nights it really got on my nerves , and if i ca n't figure it out , i do n't see how my one year old is supposed to . i can only think that there is something very screwed up with the circuitry in there . i 'm not dismissing this item all together . the music is lovely - not too simplified and not too electronic-sounding . the minute waltz is particularly nice ( i 've noticed my son scans for it ) . the lights are lovely too , and do look pretty when they 're moving if you can stand the buzzing . my son has come to depend on the music to amuse himself with as he falls asleep . but , if you buy it , i 'd recommend testing the buttons and the motorized rotator before screwing the very flimsy mobile pieces together in case you need to return it .
toys	a friend of mine has zombies ! ! ! , also by twilight creations . i 've played it a few times , and found it pretty enjoyable . zombietown is sort of a followup to this in some ways , and tries to expand the strategy of the game somewhat . unfortunately , it ends up far too confusing and complicated to make for fast gameplay ( it 's often very slow , in fact ) , and the strategy is more shallow than risk . ya know the stereotypically confusing instructions of insert tab a into slot b ? that 's pretty much what the instructions to this read like . they 're fairly poorly written to boot . there were also a couple problems we ran into the rules did n't seem to cover . i ca n't recall them off the top of my head , and they did n't come up very often , but it was still irritating . overall , definetly not reccomended . at $ 40 in stores , and $ 35 off amazon , it 's also a huge ripoff . what do you get in the box ? like 100 tiny army men-esque figures , a couple of packs of cards , and a laminated piece of cardboard . i understand why it is expensive , as i 'm sure this was a low budget item and such , but zombies ! ! ! was much less expensive .
toys	we just put the stupid thing together and put the batteries in and nothing worked . the light would go on and off , but there were no sounds at all . we made sure we had everything plugged in correctly , but it still would n't work . after all the time of putting it together what a disappointment . i will be calling fisher price tomorrow and seeing if they have any suggests and/or taking it back to toyrus .
toys	this set is perfect for a younger child ! having 100 markers to work with is great . i know when i was younger , i loved having little carrying cases for eveything to keep organized ... i wish i had had this cute little case when i was 5
toys	how annoyed am i ? today my son is 5 an aunt bought the tmnt monster jam truck ; so we , supposedly , bought the battery to go with it . wrong this does not go with it . son has a toy with no battery , we have a battery with no toy . well done toys'r'crap . will never buy here agai
toys	i work at a daycare and have an 11 mo old and can promise this is a great toy ! my baby loves it and she usually gets bored with toys fast . all of the babies like to open and close the door and crawl through . it also has a doorbell that rings and a light that turns on . it plays several different songs and really keeps the attention of older children as well as babies . i highly recommend
toys	this is very small . it 's too small for a play kitchen . and you only get one not two like is pictured
toys	my daughter recv 'd this from her grandmother for her third b/d and i think its alot cuter than in the picture . it has worked fine for my daughter she has figured out how to work it by herself and even has shown mommy how to turn it on once in awhile . she likes playing the cds with her name in them that her grandpa got her for her b/d . the only thing i did wrong was let my daughter keep it in her room w/o me checking up on her , she went and poured some kind of liquid in the storage compartments so i had to take it away as punishment . i have forgotten about it until i seen this ad which now i think i will get it back out and let her play with it again . i have even played my cds on this while cleaning the kitchen and they sounded fine . my daughter has alot of the princess furniture in her room and this really matched and is very cute , and we have had no problems with this item so far . ( knock on wood ) .
toys	i was very happy with the lincoln logs i ordered for my three year old grandson . he has been enjoying them . they seem to be more complicated than they were when my son was his age which was about 35 years ago or close to it . then it was only one small log cabin but this set is a western building . my grandson has still been able to build something that he likes . thank you for making it available
toys	i had a radio flyer wagon just like this as a child and loved it , which is why i wanted one for my daughter . we bought ours when our daughter was a year old , and she loved being pulled around the neighborhood in it . now that she 's four , she loves pulling her one-year-old little brother around , or posing for pictures with him in it . we use it for picnicing in the local park , or setting up an impromptu lemonade stand on the front lawn . the wagon seems to keep popping up in our family photos , from the labor day block party to halloween trick-or-treating . it 's a `` classic '' for good reason -- kids love it , and never stop loving it
toys	my one year old has had this toy for about 4 months now and it 's still his favorite toy . there is no end to the amount of fun my child has with this toy and he keeps coming up with new ways to play with it . it 's hours of endless entertainment !
toys	my daughter just received this as a christmas gift . she was so excited . my husband and mother-in-law went to the tv to install it . 15 minutes later my five year old is in tears . i wish this had been reviewed before we purchased . the graphics are terrible . this will be going back to the store . glad i still have the receipt .
toys	i got this toy with my own money and i think i wasted it bigtime ! i play with the products more than the store.i think it should have been bigger and come with more stuff i nd not have had all that crap painted on the card borad backs to the shelves and i think it should had come with plastic strong backs instead of card borad stuff . i uassly take out the card borad backs and make the store be a grocery store i would not buy this toy i would by the nursery playset instead.im 11 yrs ol
toys	i bought this car for my 4 1/2 year old son who absolutely loves the movie cars . he also loves those hot wheels cars . i got him this car , and he really liked it . in fact , all of my kids ( ages 4-15 ) like it ! it 's a really cute toy . it 's even great if you are a cars collector
toys	great company - terrible toy . my daughter got this toy for christmas and waited all day for daddy to bring home the 4 c batteries which were not included . she was excited until we turned it on . 1 ) the frame is not secure and will open when you reach into the middle to change the picture disk . 2 ) the light is not very bright and will not work in mid-day light . 3 ) the image is quite small - only takes up the middle 3 inches of the paper - not even close to what is pictured on the box . 4 ) the clamps that hold the paper are not easy for tiny fingers to use . 5 ) because the small picture is in the middle of the page and the clamps are on the far edges , you ca n't shift the paper to re-use the paper . you get one tiny picture in the middle of standard size piece of paper and its a waste . the chalk board was fine - but the whole piece slides across the table when you push to draw . big disappointment . get some washable markers and some tracing paper and do n't waste your money on this suprisingly junky toy
toys	we got this when our son was about 4 months old and at first he did love it . there was a slight rubber\plastic smell with everything in the tub time tub but we thought it would fade with time . well six months later the smell was still there and our son ended up stop playing with most of the bath toys except the squirting bath buddies.we did all the precautionary steps to keep the bath toys clean yet they grew mold in a very short amount time . the playtime tub toys were good except the teething sailing boats which also had the rubber smell . plus the stacking tubs do not make practical storage because the lids are too flimsy . there are some good points with this product but i feel it is not worth the $ 35 price tag . guess that 's why it was on clearance at the store . it was the combination of quality and price that made me give it only 2 stars .
toys	my daughter had this when she was a teenager . now my grandchildren come and play the game she had . to preserve the original game i ordered new ones to replace my daughters game when she had it . the grandchildren , all 6 of them , love playing this game at our house
toys	i bought this for my three year old godson last thanksgiving , and he loved it . the pieces are bright , sturdy , and easy to grasp with tiny hands . i 've purchased several melissa and doug products , and i 've never been disappointed
toys	i was very pleased with the light sabers , i gave them to my two grandsons for christmas and they loved them , they were made very well , my grandsons are 7 and 5 years old and they played pretty rough with them , they had lots of fun with them
toys	my 6 year old absolutly adores junie b. santa brought her the leapter for chrismas and grandma gave her the junie b game . she only puts it down to go to sleep . there are a few games ( word searches and finding a noun/verb/adjective and great for 1st/2nd graders . it is a great learning tool . the software is set up like the junie b jones journal book . if you child loves junie b she will definetly adore the game
toys	this is a very cute and realistic set . the measurements are all accurate . the whisk is very dangerous though . it is metal . one of the `` things '' came out of the handle and stuck out like a weapon . one of the kids could have been severely injured had i not found it and thrown it away . if you buy this item , make sure get rid of the whisk !
toys	this toy is not good at all ! its hard for the reflecters to stay still and to connect . its hard to trace the picture because you can hardly see your hand ! plus it the picture moves , thats it ! you have to start all over again . its better if you just take a piece a paper and putting it over the picture and traceing it that way , trust me i ended up just doing that
toys	my son has really enjoyed this , however , after marks are made with the `` washable '' markers , it actually takes about 3 washings to get the marks out but they do come out eventually
toys	do n't buy this price increased version . i does n't work any better than the $ 19.95 model . plus it uses twice the amount of batteries . the concept is great , the graphics are great and that 's the end of it . this just like the first plug and play ms pacman ( which i also bought ) and has a joy stick issue . if the manufacturer would take off the games that need the twisting action of the joy stick maybe this would actually be fun to play instead of frustrating . while playing ms pacman which is the only reason i bought these plug and plays ms pacman has a mind of her own , turns corners on her own and runs into the ghosts on her own . it 's impossible to use the joy stick without twisting it during play and then you 're out of control . it 's extremely frustrating . for as popular as pacman and ms pacman were in their day and still are these plug and plays would sell on that merit alone so take off the games needing the turning action of the joystick
toys	the game has a nice concept , if it worked . i 've been trying since christmas ( over 3 months ) to connect this game to the internet to update it for my kids and finally was able to update the firmware today . something that you will have to do to be able to get to the virtual worlds , but the web site is always down ! ! ! ! ! experancing technical problems ! ! ! and the nice window that pop 's up on the home page from the chief , asking for suggestions goes to a bad link ! ! ! i only gave it 1 star because the review process does n't have a 0 stars . do n't waste any money on this thing ! ! ! !
toys	saw this on jay leno and it was a hilarious gift ! tried it out and it dances to the chicken dance song and when you grab its neck it yelpsand pretends to choke then when you let go it continues its dance . i ca n't wait to give it as a christmas present .
toys	anything leappad is great . its one of the best things to come from the computer toy area for kids yet . my son is ahead of his class in reading with the help of leappad . at 6 he reads at a midrange grade 1 student and is progressing quickly . i highly recommend this and any other leap pad book and toy . most schools have dropped phonics from the classrooms and leappad has brought it back in a fun form your little one will love..
toys	dissapointed with this product ! our daughter can not even play with it without it falling apart ! small pieces that disconnect from swing not a good idea for childrens toys
toys	i asked my sister to buy this bike for my daughter for xmas last year - she decided to buy another one for my nephew also since he is the same age as my daughter ( 2 yrs old at the time ) . she bought the two bikes at the same time , same model , same color , same store . my daughter , who is far more coordinated then my nephew , tips over very easy , my nephew seems to do fine . my daughter is taller and that may be where the difference lies . perhaps the height of the child using the trike is what is causing the trike to tip easily . not sure - but i know i regret that she ever got the bike -it was a total waste of money
toys	my son and i have had the same experience with this sticker maker . great fun for the first 5-10 stickers but then the sticker role jammed and i did not have the opportunity to give the insides a good look before i was desparately trying to remember how it all went back together . too bad ... he loved it while it lasted
toys	my son has been using this table for the last 3 months and absolutely loves it . he also has the leapfrog table , but gets bored with just one . this table is on the opposite side of our ( toy-filled ) living room , and he will go over to this for a change of pace . he loves elmo and likes to hang on to his head and also mouth it . he likes to use the phone , which he also mouths - just assume he puts his mouth on everything : ) - and also the little bowl under cookie monster . so why four stars and not five ? i do wish the base had a bit more weight to it , but he can easily pull up on it without getting the whole toy over although we 've had a couple of near tips . also , the toy is a little less educational than i feel it could be since he is always accidentally setting off buttons with his arm ... so he could be pressing the triangle with his finger , but his arm could press the pig ... and off elmo goes oinking and singing about pigs . still a great toy , with lots of entertainment value , and as he matures we have less accidental set-offs . i bought it on sale and it was worth the money
toys	this is the 3rd and by far the most disappointing of all . the sound does n't work . yes , i put the batteries in correctly and yes i turned it on . the van/car kept getting stuck . my son was very disappointed and can only play pretend with it . i did n't pay all that money for an interactive toy and it does n't work . very disappointed in all these sets and will not buy another
toys	my daughter received this as a gift we all found it extremely difficult to use . i was not able to play most of the activities on the screens without first getting the handbook out doing step by step which was still not very easy to figure out . it was not at all easy for a child to enjoy . there were very few activities my 6 year old daughter was able to understand play . it is too advanced difficult to use for the ages listed . the screen on the monitor was low graphics poor lighting quality as well . this is a very expensive mistake that provided no benefit or fun to my daughter
toys	this emperor penguin puppet is a real hit with my 5 year old . we almost never use it as a puppet but rather as a plush toy/pal . this penguin looks round and pregnant , but to my kid , this penguin is a perfect friend . he has pretty much outgrown all of his plush toys , but for some reason , this one has a place in his heart and in his imagination
toys	my daughter absolutely loves rarity . it is the perfect size and goes everywhere with us . the bright colorful hair is fun to play with
toys	all the cut shapes are the same , so it 's very easy for my 3-1/2 year old to force pieces in the wrong place . the pieces also seem thin and flimsy . the coolest thing about the puzzle is the lunchbox/carrycase . all in all , the quality is much less than i expect from ravensburger . the ravensburger `` thomas giant floor puzzle ( 24 pc ) '' is a far superior product , but no longer complex enough for my kid
toys	i bought this brio train set for my 2 1/2 year old niece over christmas , and she absolutely loves it ! it 's a great starter set and can be expanded with other brio track sets . very easy to put together and the pieces are durable . makes a great gift
toys	my sons received this for christmas and it 's already out of commission . the quality of the fabric ( more like paper ) is such that the polls very quickly poked through , leaving the folding/elasticated sticks to stick out . it 's a great idea , but if it was a better material so that it would last more than a couple of weeks ... here 's hoping that i can sew up the holes without tearing it more
toys	to anyone who buys this toy , keep the box and receipt handy . we may be the odd one out , but we purchased this toy and it did n't work . the legs on manny are to be pulled back to fire a rubber ball . this did n't happen . rapid pushing and pulling of his legs produces 'rapid fire ' , and if we were lucky one would shoot out - after great effort . it comes with three foam balls , two of which fit , the third was slightly too big and would jam . ours is going back to the store today .
toys	my daughter ( age 13 ) really enjoyed this game . it provides more options than scrabble , which sometimes frustrates her because her mom and dad are better at that .
toys	this is a horrible edition of this game . it has a limited amount of games and it does n't play like the tv game at all . save some money and buy the old boxed editions from [ ... ] or get the newest version ... you 'll like it a lot more .
toys	this is the best deck ever ! but if you are looking for armed dragon lv7 go to soul of the deulist booster packs because this does n't have it . but i love red eyes darkness dragon
toys	i would n't waste my time buying anything from this company . we purchased the train table for a christmas gift and while assembling it on christmas eve there were quality issues . several drilled holes were not drilled in the proper position and the table surface had several deep scratches . i called and e-mailed the company several times to try and obtain replacement parts and never got a response . most companies want you to contact them when you need replacement parts rather than returning it to the store , but not kidkraft
toys	this was very dissapointing ! ! my daughter was so excited to get it and could barely use it . the mat is supposed to be color coordinated with the screen however the colors seem to be all the same shade . the mat looks like it comes from the dollar store , or they ran out of color at the factory . my daughter asked her sister why mommy got this ugly one ... .not like the box or commercial !
toys	the box was a huge hit with my 4 year old and he loved the extra , `` hidden '' compartment for his treat on the front . ours however got a crack in it within the first few weeks . it must have dropped just right on a corner . it 's still usable , but we 'll probably be switching before christmas break
toys	this is a great puzzle ! my son is 2 1/2 and wants to put it together almost every day ! it is amazing to watch him , because every time we sit down on the kitchen floor to do this together he can do it more and more on his own ! and when we are done he is so proud of himself , i love it ! i am online right now looking for more just like it
toys	and still loves it 7 months later ! he even takes it camping and plays for hours outside with it . we are getting him more - his dad likes to get in on it , too
toys	my 6 year old loves this book . wanting to be like her sister she is learning spanish too ! this is a very well laid out book . enhances the ability for young children to learn a second language
toys	the paint brushes are so stiff that they do not even catch the paint when you dip them and then they do not bend to meet the paper they poke the paper- i threw them out after one use
toys	i though i hated yu-gi-oh because mostly everyone i played against summoned like a dark magician without even sacrificing weird right : ( so instead i bought the computer yugi the destiny 2 learn how 2 play im a very good duelist now because i have 2 god cards obelisk and shining dragon so i bought this deck and i found this deck was unstoppable
toys	both my 3-year old daughter and my 5-year old son ( to his father 's chagrin ) love playing with and endlessly dressing dora . her outfits are darling and my children enjoy mixing and matching ( or not-so-matching in some cases ) the clothes , too . we are looking forward to adding new outfits as well as the armoire and bed - dora needs a place to sleep ! dora is well made and sturdy , and her clothing has even been through the wash and no harm done . and i have to admit ... i 've been known to dress dora a time or two myself . we have the same problem with the shoes not staying on well , but it does n't seem to bother my little ones at all
toys	our family loves this game . it brings out the creative side of people of all ages and is very fun to play . there are 5 catigories . movies , weird laws , initials , word meaning , dealers choice . everyone takes a turn orchestrating the game while the rest of the players make up ficticious answers . then that same person reads everyones made up answers along with the correct answer and you have to guess which is made up and which is the correct . we played many times over christmas with teenagers and gramdma too ! everyone was having such a great time we did n't want the game to be over . turn off the tv , make some popcorn and re-connect with your family with this fun , no pressure to win game
toys	we recieved this bed as a hand-me-down from a friend 's child who used it until he was eight ( would not give it up sooner ) . my son recieved the bed at two-years-old and is now four . this bed is durable ! the bed we have is twelve years old and looks brand new . it is so easy to wipe clean . my son feels that his bed is special and just adores it . he sees `` regular '' beds other places and feels so proud that his bed is a blue race car . i have a feeling he 'll want to stay in this bed until his feet are hanging off the end . five stars
toys	my 3 year old received this puzzle as a gift for his 3rd yr birthday . i was n't so sure if he was ready for the puzzle at the age of 3 , but four months after his birthday together with his cousins he started putting the pieces together . he is now 3.5 yrs . and knows how to complete it all by himself within less than 10min . i give ten stars
toys	our family loves all types of memory games , and this is the most attractive . the colorful stripes on the back are great , the pictures are good , the click of the squares on the tabletop are satisfying , and the fact that they are true squares means that they fit easily and perfectly into the box . my only negative comment is that there is no indication which country each child represents . the children who play this game are capable of learning country and costume together ... i think it is an obvious teaching opportunity . in fact , i would like to know this myself
toys	lots of fun for young children . my kids ages 2 , 4 and 7 all enjoy building creatures with this set . the only negative is that there are n't very many pieces . if more than one child wants to play at a time you will need more sets
toys	solid constructed dumptruck . only problem is the dumper is higher then the matching loader . wish the loader raised higher then the dumper for better play ... for my son , not me :
toys	i bought the familiy fun pack ( $ 65 ) from the ad on tv ! what a mistake ! when it arrived one tub was open and spilled all inside the box while another unopened tub was nearly dried out . no return label or customer service number was enclosed so i could n't even return it ! it is such a mess and smells like chemicals . it stuck to a votive candle holder ok and it looks kind of cute but when you try to just mold it all it does is stick to everything including your hands . some are really gooey like slimy paint while other tubs are nearly dry and you end up with micro-mini styrofoam beads all over the place and they sink down into the carpeting and wo n't come out . needless to say , it sat around for awhile until it finally made it 's way to it 's new home ... .the trash
toys	i nearly bought this until i read that it involves cardboard and stickers . that 's shameful . search amazon 's partners and other major booksellers for the `` nostalgia '' edition of stratego . it runs $ 4 or $ 5 more . it has plastic pieces with metallic paint . this game is a blast ; you and your kids are going to play it a lot
toys	i purchased this as a birthday gift for my 11 year old grandson . i knew it would be a hit as my son had received it as a gift from his grandparents as a child and was entertained for hours with it . it did not lose it 's charm for 11 year old boys through the years . my grandson was thrilled with it as well . just enough challenge to keep their interest
toys	this game is ok , entertains my children for a little while . i thought everything was ok , but then , after only a couple of months , the cartridges started to malfunction ! we have two leap pads and some games work in one , but not the other ( and visa versa ! ) for the price , i do n't want the toy to not work 1/2 the time after only a few uses . the books seem to hold up pretty good , but the cartridges do n't . and , at a price of around $ 12 each , i was very dissapointed . if the cartridges worked all the time , i would probably give this toy 4 stars , as it is fun ( when it works ) and portable . one last comment for improvement , would be to have the volume be on the outside , not in the book , as the regular volume is a bit too loud and i have to ask my little one to turn it down each time she switches books/cartridges
toys	my 4-yr old daughter really wanted this for christmas , and santa was kind enough to bring it for her . the quality is fine , but it just does n't do much . she played with it for the first day , and has touched it maybe twice since . i 've seen these on clearance everywhere i 've gone lately , too . if your child is into playing `` mommy '' , this is cute , but the extra money you pay for something that moves and talks does n't really equate to lasting play value with this one
toys	my 11 yr old son got these moon shoes at christmas and he plays with them a lot . he has adhd and sensory integrative dysfunction , and the bouncing really soothes him and gets him refocused . i do n't think he ever expected to bounce very high ; he seems to be happy enough with the bounce he gets . when he wants to play with them in the house , i send him downstairs to jump around on the concrete floor to save wear and tear on my hardwoods . the downside for us has been that the bands have started snapping very frequently . at the rate he 's going , he 'll run out of bands long before he outgrows wanting to play with the toy . so if anyone hears of a way to get more bands , please speak up
toys	my son received this as a gift . i love that the inside is set up like `` shelves '' . my son loves to organize his trains in it . i do n't like how thin the metal is . it dents as easy as a cola can . if it were made better , it would be worth the money . save your money on this one and find something better made
toys	every family , every party , every gathering of kids and adults or combinations of both will love this game
toys	i am in my twenties ... i had one of these dogs when i was little and i loved it . it shows kids the way dogs naturally feed their puppies . of course it is only a stuffed animal so it is not going to do anything . but in my opinion it is a very cute toy for a dog love
toys	i 'll start off by saying that this is the company to buy naruto headbands from . it is high quality fabric that is very comfortable on the skin and the length will fit around anyone 's head ( trust me , i have a pretty big head ) . the insignia plate is made out of real metal and is engraved superbly . a velcro padding on the back ensures that the plate does n't touch your forehead and cause discomfort . in other words , this headband is like it was plucked out of the show itself , and for the price , it is a very nice addition to any naruto fan 's wardrobe
toys	ok so my daughter was 2 3/4 and not 3 ( toy rated for age 3 ) , but she loves elmo and loves playing with this toy . it is somewhat loud an there is no volume control . also after 4 months of use the pen stopped working , rendering the toy worthless . also the binding is weak and my daughter has torn the sheets with normal use . so fun toy while it lasts
toys	this toy is a terrible disappointment . it falls apart immediately , is very poorly designed , and ridiculously difficult for a child ( or adult ) to put together .
toys	my six month old grandson loves these toys ! they are perfect for the teether and he loves the colors and noise . they hold his attention for much longer than some of his other toys . they are easy for him to hold and shake . i would buy them again in a minute .
toys	i bought this for my year old grandaughter and am more than pleased . it is very heavy so as the child stands up to play it does not move at all . the corners are rounded so there are no sharp points for the child to hurt themselves on . it will hold their attention for quite a while as there are five activities for them to play with . the price was very reasonable compaed to other similar products .
toys	i was so disappointed with this item . my son ( who 's 3 ) received this for his bday . the child has to continuously hold down a button with his hand to keep the train moving and my son could n't do it . he ended up getting so frustrated , he broke down in tears ! the noises the train makes are much too loud ! and you need a lot of room in your home to set up the track , which we do not have . i was surprised at how poorly designed this was since it 's a peg perego . the manufacturers should 've really tried this one out on the recommended age group before they released it . why could n't there be a pedal to step on to make it go like every other ride-on toy for little ones ? i put it back in the box and back to the store it went .
toys	this item showed up on time and without incident ... i 'm not sure what else i can expect from a pair of novelty glasses .
toys	bought these beads for my 18 month old . he enjoys taking them in and out of the container . they are made out of thick plastic but are too heavy to stay snapped together . when we snapped 4 or more together they would not stay snapped together because the weight of the beads pulled them apart as soon as they 're moved
toys	i love this motorcycle and it is a `` no-duh '' that it does n't run on fuel . really ... think ... what fuel are you going to use . plus , fuel is hazardous to children and a company would n't threaten the lives of innocent children ! that 's my opinion
toys	this board is of excellent quality and is highly transportable , but a little small for go players who play avidly . the stones are also small , but they get the job done . why i bought this board was because i wanted to be able to take it with me , without a huge board dragging me down . this fits what i want almost perfectly . thanks
toys	purchased 2 pairs for my 8 9 year old daughters for christmas . the shoes are made of cheap pieces of plastic . the box includes bunches of black , elastic bands that you need to really s-t-r-e-t-c-h onto the shoes to provide the `` bounce '' . the more your child weighs , the more bands you use , but you have to double or triple them onto the same hooks . they are very hard to install and could be dangerous if they snap back into your face while you are installing them . once assembled , the kids played with them for about 10 minutes before becoming bored . they have n't played with them since . do n't waste your money
toys	it takes a few hands to learn all the tricks to this game , but once learned , it is a lot of fun . a good game for four players , and a great game for six players . it generates lots of lively action , with the bidding for the cards . we played this game on a cruise with four strangers . they were no longer strangers , after the game . everyone we have played with say they are going to buy it . that 's how we got it . bought the game after playing with family .
toys	i ordered this for my 7 yr old grandaughter for valentines day . upon receipt it was not operable . the user is supposed to ask the `` love ball '' a question , and then turn it over to see the answer under a clear glass window . the answer would not appear under window it seemed to be covered with a dark liquid
toys	my 6 8 year olds sons received this toy for christmas . they are huge pokemon fans so just the fact that it has pokemon pictures on it made the toy worth it . fortunately , it also happens to be fun to play . 2 to 4 players try to allow the fewest balls possible past their own paddles . the fewest points wins . each player has their own scorekeeper for up to 5 games . setting up the game after every round gets a little tedious , however it 's not so bad if everyone helps . the 2 best things for me are that i do n't mind playing ( unlike the actual pokemon cards which are a boring nightmare for me ! ) and it does n't require batteries ! ! my 3 year old daughter likes to play too although she loses every time . we just do n't tell her . if your kids like pokemon , this is a good toy
toys	my 3 yr old grandson loves this . he can manage it ok. good gift
toys	we played this game with 3 couples and all of us enjoyed in very much we laughed the whole time it was a very enjoyed game for all
toys	using his superior intellect and quick wit , einstein takes on all evil doers who dare to engage him in combat . with the energy stored in the mass contained within his mighty chalk piece that he raises confidently in his right hand he commands the vast power of mathematics to defeat those who dare to forget to carry the one
toys	very cute product and well worth the money . my three year old loves all the things he can do with it in the bath tub
toys	the tail rotor fell off right out of the box on the first throttle up . the landing gear fall off if you do not glue them yourself . not only is it poorly made for the money but it is an extreemly touchy machine . main rotor to tail mixing have to be perfect . final thought ... . after several hours of hard work adjusting the tail to main rotor mix i managed to get it to stay in the air for a few seconds . if you want an r/c helicopter try the japanese made hirobo xrb sr .
toys	after hearing a lot of the songs used for other fisher price music toys , i expected the best from this one . i liked the songs included on the rom , but i expect a nice beat and catchy tune . ( like the backyardigans or the doodle bops ) . these songs are performed in a dry sort of way . they are n't even as good as the wiggles and my kids hate the wiggles . it was a bit disappointing
toys	my girls , twin 4 year olds , received this when they were 3 and have played with them over and over again in a variety of ways . great for pretend play as well educational- matching of shapes . super durable and not easy to lose . i highly reccomend these cute cupcakes for your little cupcakes
toys	this wagon was easy to put together . we use it frequently when picnicking outdoors and going to the park . it is big enough for my 2 year old to lie down and take a nap . it was also large enough to hold our lunch cooler and my daughter . it is very easy to pull around and is very durable
toys	7yr old son has had many many hours of fun rebuilding this into many different tracked and wheeled vehicles . quickly lost interest in snow monster part but the vehicle part is easily changed around for new setup each time . highly recommended
toys	this was given to my 2 year old as a present . it is really cute and he loved it but it is constantly falling apart . the roof and doors keep coming off every time it is played with . the concept is good , all the animals and farmer are built very well , but it 's frustrating to me and my son that it wo n't stay together .
toys	ok this isnt really a review but more of a reaction to another review , which in my opinion was written by no child . it 's just a doll ... get over it . and stop wasting the space where some of us people actually write real reviews . i just had to say something about that . oh ... i did order this doll but i 'm still waiting for her to arrive :
toys	my 6 year old loves this toy . she made all 3 bears at one time . my husband helped her . they are well made and close up in the back with a zipper and special tool , so they do not come undone unless you want to open them and re-stuff them
toys	purchased this as a gift for my grandchildren ... .this is boring and absolutely no fun no matter what your age . i guess for almost $ 40 you should n't expect flashing lights or something a little more exciting . does n't even deserve the one star i gave it .
toys	my 3 year old opened this for christmas and loved it . who would have guessed that this little car would have been a bigger hit than a lot of the more expensive things he was given ! it does n't get stuck on any surface that we 've tried it on and drives right over things in its path , which my son thinks is really cool ! great toy for a relatively inexpensive price
toys	excellent i love chimps and watch all documentaries , so i had to have this one for my birthday and i am thirty seven years old.i would buy from you again
toys	the main issue is the controls . we are having a hard time getting this thing to fly well and the idea of pulling down to go down is weird to us pilot types . it tends to just nose dive regardless . we will give it another go at the park tomorrow but so far all it does is crash . that it 's still in one piece is amazing
toys	my three year old takes a `` rest '' instead of a nap , which means he stays in his room for a quiet time so mommy has some sanity . he ca n't tell time , so he would come out every 5 minutes to see if rest time was over . in order to keep him in there for an hour i purchased this clock so he can see and hear when his time was up . it works perfectly and he is n't anxious about when his time is up . he understood the concept of the clock changing from green to yellow to red quickly and knows when the clock is red that his time is almost up . i set the clock to announce when his time is up and then he comes on out . no more `` is it time yet ? '' . i get my full hour of sanity uninterupted !
toys	if you want a beautiful asian doll , i just found a couple in ebay under `` asian berenguer girl doll `` . the one i got on ebay was gorgerous ! ! ! my daughter loves it and wo n't leave home without it .
toys	the start button is too difficult for even a three year old to hold down . the battery is tedious to re-charge ( required after every use ! ) . dangerous . when child leans slightly to the side the entire engine will turn over . for all your time and money you will only see a child with a bored expression - or a frustrated child who ca n't operate start button alone . you could tape down the button and then the child must ask for you to stop it . total supervision required any way you look at it . a real expensive , gimicky toy !
toys	i wanted my daughter to be able to listen to music without headphones . this product , the fp3 speakers , was perfect . she loves to walk around from room to room singing her favorite songs and carrying this around . it is easy to turn on and very kid friendly . the only downfall is that the price dropped right after i purchased it !
toys	love this game . with family and/or friends it 's one of the best card games around . it is easy and does n't require a lot of attention ( you can watch movies , talk , hang out , etc . ) yet keeps your interest . it 's also a game people of many ages can play because it 's not too difficult . a good card game for having friends over to play over dinner or while watching a ballgame .
toys	this action figure is sitting on my desk at home . he 's my little computer buddy . it 's really not bad at all , although the plastic hair does n't allow his head to move very much . when i 'm writing , and i get to a point where i need to back off a bit , i pick him up and change the pose , or threaten my daughter with the masamune , or she and i set him up for a couple of humourous pics . it 's great . all hail sephi ! ! ( and you can just hear it , why the heck are you calling me that ? well , why not ? it 's weird and it 's not right ! but , sephi ... . ) hahahaha . ca n't wait to get cloud too . then things in my house will be interesting
toys	whoever decided this was good for four year-olds must not be a parent of said age group . my four year-old received this as a birthday present . his adult aunt could barely figure it out . it 's one of those toys that collapses the moment you play with it , taking all the fun out of the imaginative play that should be occuring . we have all the little parts and bigger pieces in a pile and he just walks around with the bigger piece wondering what to do with it , even though we have the corresponding mystic force power rangers themselves . i think this toy should be perhaps 1/4 of the price listed . simply disappointing
toys	sure this does n't make the popular clanking sound going down the stairs as the metal originals , but it still works well , and has been copied by many companies . i even have one with a business name on it . these fun , functional , and keep a kids imagination engaged . no noise or batteries needed . buy someone you know this for a stocking stuffer this year
toys	whenever we take this bike to the park , boys and men of every description crown around it in awe . my son , who is seven and so far not athletic at all , loves the recognition , not to mention the nifty spin outs he can perform for everyone watching . we just wish it came in an adult size
toys	i got this for my 3 year old niece . she loves it and requests that it go with her all the time . the box to hold all the pieces is handy , the magnets are easy and there 's lots of variations of outfits . having 2 dolls makes it easy for friends , parents etc to play along and interact . the only cons i see is that the box with all the pieces is a bit heavy , it could use a handle . and the magnets are strong but sometimes the pieces slip a bit . all in all , a great gift and toy !
toys	i just got the whole set of geotrax and really think they look great and way cheaper than thomas however the round housecan only hold one train at a time so it derails the train if you have more than one locomotive . they really need to add the reverse as well so they kids and me ( mom ) lol can really make use of all the options . however , overall i really love this toy but yes i had to convert my office room into the geotrax room . be ready to do this if not stick to the basic set up . its very hard though since it all is so coo
toys	this product arrived with none of the hardware needed to assemble . the table itself looked as if was used or returned for being substandard . all in all , not a good experience . i will not purchase anything from this seller agai
toys	this figure of the great wayne gretzky is a must-have for those who collect hockey memorabilia . the figurine is life-like , with gretzky 's expression looking just as it did whenever he scored a goal . what i love most about this toy is that you can purchase gretzkys that wore different jerseys to represent the eras in hockey his playing career spanned . if you are like me and collect gretzky memorabilia ( pictures , cards , jerseys , etc ) , this is an artifact that will fit quite nicely in your collection .
toys	i got a wagon like this when i was really small . now i am 14 and istill use it for getting grocries from the store . it is still in good condition except it is rusty because i used to fill it with water nd make my friends ride in it . it is fun to ride down the hill from the store too my home . it can go really fast and it 's easy to steer . you have to be careful if you cross the road and go onto a curb with kids in it . one time my mom was pulling me and my sister to the store . when she went over the curb it tipped over and my sister scraped underneath her nose . it is a great toy and even though i 'm too old for it i still like it a lot
toys	long story short . bought for daughter for christmas ... it is in the trash ... this was the worst toy/doll purchase ever
toys	this is an extremely fun and addictive game . you shuffle the cards , and place three ( room , weapon , person ) in the secret envelope . in every room you go into , you can make accusations . if someone has the card you accused ( like the room ) , then they show it to you and you write it down on your notepad . the game changes constantly , so it never gets boring . the character pieces have teeny details , like mr. green has straps and buckles on his briefcase . i gave it 4 stars for education because it teaches you to focus and really think . oh , and good problem-solving skills too . and coordination ( you have to add all the clues up to see who did it ) . all in all , a terrific game . great for rainy days or playdates . and did i mention the weapons ? very realistic . and cute
toys	this toy is a ripoff for 1/2 yr. olds and you 'll get annoyed couase the games are sooooooooooo hard even for me a 12 year old and in stead you should try out this game its an internet game its better than fat tamagotchi and if you drop the tmagotchi in water it dies 4evr 4evr and evr forever do you hear me ! ! ! ! ! go to [ ... ] you wont regret it ! ! or you can laugh at me i dont car
toys	this one is rather small and does n't really look or feel like the rest . not as durable feeling as the others
toys	this paint brush globs out the paint , does n't spread to make any kind of picture and the brush barely holds any paint . we went through both of the provided things of paint in about five minutes and had no picture to show for it . not to mention that the bottle is to small for the brush to fit in so when the paint is about half way down you ca n't get the brush in it to suck the paint up . i am so disappointed
toys	this is one of the most fun games i 've every played . there are tons of belly laughs as people try to bluff their way through an answer to a question . i find the questions ( and answers ) are quite educational too , i 've learned a lot from these questions . a group of family members played at christmas ( 6 of us ) and it was hilarious to watch some people try to come up with an answer to the question ( a bluff ) . we even let our 5 year old nephew `` play '' and he was pretty good with coming up with some bluffs . try it , it is loads of fun . i recommend a group of at least 4 though
toys	i purchased the 12-prank kit for my 83 year old aunt this past christmas . on christmas morning , as everyone opened the usual boring gifts of knit sweaters and scented candles , my elderly aunt carefully tore open her prank kit . it was an instant hit ! as she laid out her fake dog poop on the floor next to the christmas tree and blew her new fart whistle , everyone started to roll with laughter . oddly enough , this inexpensive little gift became the high-point of our family christmas gift-giving . maybe that sounds pathetic , but my aunt was carried back to younger days when she used to pull pranks with whoopie cushions on her little nephews . thanks to this great little package , we all laughed so hard it hurt . what an awesome gift
toys	i read all the negative reviews on this table and decided to go ahead and order hoping i would get lucky and not have all the problems the other customers had . do n't do it ! the table arrived poorly packaged and beat up just as the others here have described . one corner of the table top was bashed in , another piece of wood was split , the green paint from the table top rubbed off onto the white table leg , and edge of the other table leg was dented in revealing the plywood underneath the paint . this is a very cheap table - cheaply constructed of plywood . it is functional , but just not very attractive since it arrives already damaged . just beware before you buy that you will more than likely be getting a banged up train table
toys	my two daughters ( two and four ) got this for christmas from `` santa '' , after seeing this , they no longer had any interest in any other gift . they love it and spend hours on in fixing each others hair
toys	ummm ... i am a huge fan of bratz , but this piece of junk is absolutely terrible . first of all , the eyes are super ugly . i ca n't believe they would make such an ugly product ! the lips are fine . but i could reconsider by making better , cuter eyes ! they broke when i had it after five minutes . they do not blink . they try to , but do n't succeed . do not buy ! ! second , the features are horrible . they are made so bad , i tried to make it walk since it could n't on it 's won ! it does not walk . note that . also , it 's head does not move . it was broken on mine and it made it fall down and the neck , while trying to move , muffled the song . also , unless you wan na hear the same 20 second `` bratz catz '' song over and over again , do not buy this product . it will dissapoint your daughter like it did to me . i am the daughter , but am very dissapointed . i have returned mine and did not get a new one , either . i got some bratz babyz which were cuter than this junk ! i am warning you , this cat is brainwashed and should not be continued . do not buy this product unless you want a crying daughter for it ! ! ! thank you for your patience and gratuity in reading this grievance . love , brownie , baby doll lover . get babies instead , they 're cute !
toys	i misunderstood the dimensions listed ( 7.5 x 1.5 x 10.5 inches ) and thought it would be large enough for my mother to see and handle . it is n't . apparently , the dimensions include the packaging . she loves wheel of fortune on tv , and i thought this game would be terrific therapy for her hands . very disappointing . i 'll be returning it , unopened .
toys	we bought this for our 3 year old daughter for christmas . we turned it on right away and she was very excited until the sound suddenly started to fade out . we thought it was just a case of dead batteries , so we replaced the batteries - several times - until we realized the product was just bad . when trying to get it replaced , we were told they were out of stock and our money would be refunded instead . needless to say , our daughter was very sad and we will not be buying this product anywhere , ever . we 'll just stick with another type of keyboard to help our daughter develop a love of music
toys	i bought these skates for my almost 3 yr old who wants to be like her big sister . the skates are good overall . they are easy enough to put on and take off . the padding inside is nice . the only drawback i can find is the the adjustment lever that keeps the wheels from rolling on setting 1 changes by itself to setting 2 which lets the wheels roll . i am not sure if i just got a bad pair or if this happens with all of these kinds of skates . i will keep them but it does get to be a hassle to have to keep putting them on the correct setting .
toys	the game of memory is a great equalizer because little children are just as apt to remember where they saw the hidden images as older children or adults . this makes it great game for the whole family to play together . the images from the `` i spy '' book illustrations are bright and creative . they do n't match exactly- for instance , there might be two images of cats , but borrowed from different photographs in the i spy books . so there is a bit more visual variety to spice things up . this is a much more attractive memory game than most , and would make an ideal gift for a child or family
toys	this is a very fun toy . there are numerous buttons and sounds that my children enjoyed very much . after you close the phone , it rings a couple seconds later , and the kids loved to answer it and pretend to talk to people . unfortunately the two i bought quit working within a short time of buying them . i bought the first one last year for my son , and it lasted for about a week . first the recording feature stopped working . then none of the sounds worked . new batteries did n't help , i even opened it up to see if any transistors had burned out or there were any shorts . did n't find any problems ... it just refused to work . we bought a second one for christmas 06 , and it 's already quit too . we 'll try to stay away from this brand
toys	the barbie plug and play 12 dancing princesses thing is a joke . my daughter only wanted that for christmas for three months . after the one on christmas morning did not function at all , the second one was so terrible that she gave up after two days . the graphics are straight from 1981 and the `` dancing princesses '' even make roboty bendy noises as they move . very strange and disappointing
toys	after i read the reviews on this toy , i wanted to cancel my order . thankfully i did n't because my kids love it . i have two boys 5 9 and they love bowling with this toy . my kids have played with it since we got it in feburary . in the reviews , people said the toy broke soon after playing with it . my kids play with it all the time and we have not had any problems . everything still works great ; the pins , the sound , and the ball return .
toys	this was a real let down for my daughter . she loves horses and has several breyer horses . when we saw this paddock she was so excited about it . we decided to get it for her for christmas . it is very flimsy , does not stay together and breaks easily . she spent more time trying to fix it than actually playing with it . after a couple of weeks it was just completely not worth the effort and we put it up but later threw it away , only the doll and horses were salvagable
toys	the kid who wrote the 5 star reveiw is wrong . he needs to go to preschool . first , the pagages arent free , if they didnt come w/the maker no one would buy it . second , this kid says it cant get any better , but it cant get any worse ! ! ! ! the 1 star reveiws say to go to mc donalds if you want a mc flurry , but dont go there and support them thats just what they want you to do so they can earn more money ! ! go to dq or just make one yourself . do not waste your money on this peice of junk ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
toys	my sister said her 3yo son loved and and was able to play in it with his 1yo brother ! i do n't really know how durable it is , she lives in another state but said they liked it alot
toys	i have two boys , 10 and 12 . the younger one bought a webkinz first and after seeing how much fun he had at the website , the older one asked for one for his birthday . the website is very kid friendly . you wo n't have to worry about what they will see on this website . it is great fun , and even i play on it ! i highly recommend this for any age child
toys	i had searched high and low via the internet trying to find the perfect baby doll pram . good quality material , well made and if possible fold away storage ability . when i found the corolle pram /carriage i thought i found it plus the added bonus of a adjustable handle so no matter how tall my grand daughter was she could push her babies . but when it arrived i was not thrilled . what looked good on paper was not so in life . true it folds away to store in a closet no problem . but this ability is to easy and i fear the child will pinch her fingers . all that keeps the stroller in an up right position in 2 lame flip over metal rings . now with the wonderful way a simple umbrella stroller for a real baby folds way , why was n't this technology used on this product . sure an adult would have to fold it up , but i would feel better if that was the case then a 4 year old maybe getting broken fingers . also the cute canopy . it does not stay on if you even move it to open a tiny bit . i spent $ 113.00 on this item thinking i was getting a well put together item that would last years for my grand daughter . only way that will happen is if i can weld parts together and forget about ever wanting to store it . i did not buy this from amazon only cause i wanted it right away and so bought it from another shop . but i knew amazon would have this forum and wanted to make sure others did not waste their money on this product . go with the other one for $ 33 at least maybe it will stay together . now i have to hope i can return this thing to where i bought it . but i think corolle should either rethink this items design or just pull it from the stores . it 's not what a good parent would want for their child . thanks i hoped this helped
toys	i have been wanted a non-electronic non-paper sudoku game for some time . rubik 's sudoku is a self contained single player game board . i can move it from room to room without the playing pieces moving from where i have placed them on the board . there is one extra piece for each number/color tile included . with the color coding it is easy to learn the strategy behind sudoku . i was not picking it up very fast when i tried the paper versions . after i progress through the 100 puzzles included with this game i 'll use the game board and pieces with the sudoku magazine i have . for the cost i would recommend this over the more expensive wood versions . if cost is not an issue then you might go for one of the more durable all wood versions that amazon has
toys	we bought this and the sing along favorites and my 5 year old loves them both . she would n't have know many songs on the other rom packs . this is definitely a hit for the younger ones !
toys	i bought this high chair for my daughter 's second birthday because i love the look of it . the similar chair made by badger basket toys gets terrible reviews for being poorly constructed so i went with this one despite it having no reviews . i could n't be happier . this high chair is solidly built and was easy to assemble . i love the white finish because it will be relatively neutral as my daughter 's room may go through decorative changes in the coming years . i do n't forsee her outgrowing this toy for quite a few years and it is sturdy enough to last . she has several dolls , the largest being her 17 '' corolle lila , who fits beautifully in the chair . i would guess that this chair could possibly handle up to a 20 '' doll . while it is solidly built , i am obviously discouraging my daughter from sitting in the chair herself ( i 've caught her trying to several times ) because no doll chair should be expected to be that sturdy ! the only real negative is the joke of a chair pad . i actually just tossed it because it does n't really add to the toy 's play value anyway and would probably just be a nuisance . i highly recommend this high chair for the child in your life who enjoys taking care of babies . it 's made me look to kidkraft for more toys and doll furniture
toys	if you 're not sure if your little one will really be `` into '' these train sets , this one is a great one to try out . it 's more fun when you get all the extra buildings , but if it 's an iffy situation , then i highly recommend this set . we bought this set for our little one because he just was n't too sure about these trains . however , after he received it , he found out that he liked them and well , now we have a bunch of them ! the $ 40 is not much to invest n a toy that they 're not going to play with either ! i just wish this set had more things with it besides just the track and the train . however , you can get a little better deal if you buy the track separately from maxim , who makes brio trains now , and the train separately as well . this train will chew up the batteries pretty quickly unless you use duracell . energizer only makes it two days in this train but duracell makes it two-and-a-half weeks . other than that , highly recommend this toy
toys	we have two new power wheels 12 volt batteries . they take a charge just fine with the charger that came with them . i bought this so we could use it as a rapid charger and it would take less time for the batteries to charge . i plugged them in and waited a few seconds . both batteries had the flashing red indicating the batteries were either a wrong battery or bad . this will not charge the batteries for me . all it does is sit there and blink red . but the batteries charge just fine with the original charger . how can they be bad batteries if they hold a charge and we get hours of play out of them on a full charge . funny that . makes me wonder if it is a marketing ploy for people to run right out and buy a new $ 50 battery to replace the `` bad '' one . if it would actually work to charge the battery then it would be great . but we can not get past the red light with ours . it is going right back to the store ! ! ! it might be slower but we will stick with our original charger from now on .
toys	first of all i think the concept is great however the safety bobber does n't open and after about a dozen casts the reel fell apart . if you 're looking for something that shoots , buy a rocket rocket not this rocket fishing rod and save some money . shame on you roland martin for sponsoring such a piece of garbage . do n't expect to catch fish with this it is simply a novelty item
toys	this little toy is cute . my 11 month old son loves blues clues and loves this toy . he will hold him on his lap while he watches his favorite show ! its really cute
toys	my son loves cars and trucks so this looked like it would be a big hit , but like the other reviewers , we have had to put this toy away because of all the injuries . he used the handle to push it , but the toy is unbalanced , so any pressure on the back causes it to flip up and hit him in the face . he 's had several big bruises and one cut lip . since posting this , i 've spoken to a rep for little tykes . she said they would look into this toy a bit more and sent a replacement toy for my son to play with until he is able ( if ever ) to use the dump truck again . if you 've had a problem with this truck , please call them so that they can get it on record
toys	i love the upstairs . it is so fun . because it has an upstairs , you can move up a level twice as fast . it is more fun to play when you also have the love 2 shop malls . ( quoted from my 10 year old daughter
toys	this item is really small . i did n't read the other reviews and missed the info on the actual size of the item . in hindsight , i would n't have order it had i paid more attention . i think the other products from haba ( eggs and teabags ) are worth the money for the size .
toys	we bought two sets of the alphabet foam play mats - so glad we did ! we have a concrete basement floor , and now the kids have a nice , colorful , and soft place to play . plus , the foam floor is n't as cold as the concrete - wer 're in colorado . the colors are great - so inviting . the pieces fit together perfectly , and the border gives it a finished look . great purchase ! we 'll probably buy more so that we can increase the size of the play area !
toys	i bought this for my son 's second christmas ; he was almost 2 . it was a recommendation of one of my parenting magazines and i had to hunt it down 3 years ago . he loved pounding the balls and he even could match the color of the ball to the color of the hole ! he still plays with it and i will be buying his baby brother one when he 's big enough
toys	my 3 boys ( ages 4 , 7 and 9 ) love their lightsabers so the idea of a spring activated version was too hard to pass up . imagine the disappointment when the fragile spring/force action is only good for about 3 tries and then it falls apart with no way to get inside and fix it . we have 3 of them ( darth vader , obi-wan and luke skywalker ) . vader was done before 9am christmas morning . the other two are hanging on by a thread and now the boys have to be `` very gentle '' when they load the saber . the worst part is that the light up feature is tied to the spring so it does nothing now . these are not rough kids and it 's just a matter of time before the other springs get jammed . stick with the original light up sabers and forget the force action .
toys	this puzzle is a lot of fun and my son loves it . the container is a toy for itself
toys	i do n't know why poor scrat got so many bad reviews . my kids absolutely love this toy . they laugh hysterically every time and they 're 4 1/2 and 7 . he does have a tendency to fall down and does n't scoot very well . but the laugh factor alone makes this well worth the money .
toys	this game set it of amazing quality . every piece has so much detail it just looks good without doing anything ! the dubloons are the best part , and like others have said , make the best clinking sound when you drop a pile into your hand . this game is definately worth buying ... . if you come up with some new rules that make the game more interesting . the gameplay is very uninteresting , boring , and brainless . my wife never passes up an opportunity to tell me how boring it was , and even her younger ( 12 year old ) sister thought it was boring and had more fun playing with the pieces . my wife says i should have bought us settlers of catan instead of spending my money on this ( before we got our own set ... now we have one ) , but when i bought it i knew it would be just for the game pieces . i am brewing up some good rules to change the gameplay dramatically and make it much more interesting . she likes settlers so much.. maybe i will get some trade of spices into the game and whatnot . anyways , if you are creative and have a good idea for a ship game , then definately get this game set . it is high quality and beautiful . but , if you do n't have the interest to make your own game , then pass this one up because you would most likely love to play any other game you own before this
toys	this item is sooooo cute ! garfield is dressed in his jammies and is clutching pookie in his left arm . we highly recommend ty goodnight garfield , especially if you are a garfield fan
toys	puchased for my grandoughter who is 5 years old . she liked very much playing the puzzle . only thing we didnot like the quality of side parts gone bad very quickly .
toys	when my 25 year old daughter sat down to play wedgits with her younger siblings , she declared that she wanted a set for christmas . she thinks it will be a great coffee table game for all her college friends . my friend got a set for her grandkids but when the family gets together her son and son-in- law monopolize them with their little competitions . these are wonderful for the imagination , and with wedgits you will have a toy that adults will enjoy playing with and that makes the children very happy
toys	i ordered the ants in december ( christmas present ) , and although the temperatures were unseasonably warm here throughout january , no ants arrived . i have called several times , with the same excuse . they have my money and wo n't deliver the ants . i would suggest any other company besides uncle milton industries
toys	i ca n't believe how well made this set is . i have been looking for good quality kitchen toys for my daughter for christmas . i wanted something sturdy and not plastic . i just received my order today and these items are great ! my son opened the box and tested them for his little sister and he ca n't wait to play with them with her . i ordered this set and the baking set and both are made out of solid wood and are extremely durable . i am very impressed and wish amazon carried the matching coffee pot and blender ! i also had a problem with the velcro on the butter . it was an easy fix with some super glue . i think the heat during the shipping made the velcro come off
toys	great ! ! ! it is the perfect place to store all those wooden puzzles we all have for our toddlers ! the puzzles slide right in on the small metal rods ... very easy to remove puzzles ! i also like the fact that is made of a lovely natural wood ! we have this in our living room , and it is quite attractive
toys	i bought this game based on the reviews on amazon and i am not disappointed . even my three year old enjoys this game and is capable of understanding the concept . the beginner puzzles are right up his alley and the expert puzzles are challenging enough for me .
toys	i purchased this item as a christmas gift . on the day after christmas , i helped my son assemble this product . it worked flawlessly for the first day . the next day , i turned it on to show the boys ' grandmother . apparently , the steel ball `` wheels '' under the `` riders '' do n't roll very well after initial use . the riders would be hoisted to the top , but would fail to slide onto one of the chutes . if they did make it onto a chute , they would sometimes fail to glide all the way to the bottom , or would fall off the chute . the failure rate went from 0 % when first used to about 90 % after the first day . i 've purchased other k'nex items before and never had a problem
toys	i say that because the paint on these cars chips very easily . the hamm car was already chipped sealed in the package . my son 's matchbox cars , which get tossed into their basket quite regularly , do n't seem to chip near as easy as the cars ones do . never-the-less , kids do n't care . though , my son ( who is only 3-1/2 ) is wondering why they did n't make a red ramone or the announcer cars ( bob and darryl ) ? ? also , for collectors , the sarge and fillmore are shown on the back of the card as being sold as individual items , but on the back of the hamm card , they are not shown . i have as of yet see them sold individually on the supercharged card
toys	i bought 8 sets of these mats to completely cover my son 's playroom . of the 8 , there were 6 perfect sets . the other 2 had very rough sections that caused major irritation on my son 's knees . when i contacted the company , they gave me a very hard time about the issue and basically said they wouldnt do anything about replacing those mats until they received them back and could do an investigation as to how this could have happened . they kept saying that they had never seen anything like this before as though i was making the issue up . in the end , i was so unhappy with their attitude that i returned all 8 sets and went with another brand . be careful and check the quality of the sets that you receive !
toys	my son ( now 4 ) loves cars , so when i saw this bed frame , i thought this is it ! well , looks can fool you . i also read many glowing reviews about this bed frame , so i was confident that this was a must buy . but after using it for a while ( 1 year now ) , i am very disappointed . if i would buy another bed frame , this one would not be in my shopping list . what i and all my family do n't like about this frame : 1 . the front end of the car frame is shaped like a sports car , so people hit that protruding part all the time when walking in the room , making people falter sometimes . 2 . since it is made of plastic , it gets really cold , and it really feels terrible . i do n't know why it is damn cold all the time . 3 . i had to exchange the regular-height box spring for a half-height one , because the regular-height box spring would be too high and the sides of the bed frame would not provide adequate protection against falling . 4 . so many toys and things fall between the mattress and the bed frame . i have to lift the damn mattress and then go into the car frame to pick up all the junk that my son loves to shove into the little openings . 5 . i think the bed frame takes up way too much space for a twin sized bed . it is waste of space . 6 . my son was disappointed that the wheels do n't spin . and i think he has a point , since this bed frame costs so much . my son now do n't even think it 's a cool thing . well , he stopped liking the bed only after a few days . 7 . the head part of the bed is also plastic , and for some reason , your head can go under that plastic , because that head part comes over the mattress . it is quite annoying , and we had to put another pillow to cover that part of the frame . and you ca n't even use it as a shelf since it is not flat . dolls and little toys that we put up there would slide down to hit our son or slide to the sides and fall into the corner where there is a big opening between the walls and the car frame . 8 . again , it is very very cold , and it really feels terrible when you want to sleep at night and everything around you is so cold and hard . this is a miserable bed , and i feel bad that i bought this horrible bed for my loving son . we are gon na sell it for 100 dollars ( we hope ) in the summer . the only reason for giving 2 stars is because , it is very solid
toys	sooo cute . santa gave my 7 y.o . daughter the dog and cat versions of this game . she and i have already spent several hours playing with her `` pets '' . unlike the earlier pets , there is more to do than just care for your pet . there are games , activities and interactions with pet friends . there is a whole village of homes and places to visit . you collect stickers throughout your adventures . for instance there are 29 stickers available for making friends . it is represented by a heart sticker . everytime you collect a sticker , you are taken to your sticker book and it indicates how many stickers are available and how many you have obtained . there are three exterior buttons for use to play with , groom and feed your pet . when your pet ignores you , it means it is time for grooming , playing or eating . sometimes your pet will suddenly disappear and then reappear at their potty mat having left a little undesirable . my daughter thinks that is hilarious . kids ! the only drawback is that the screen does not light up for play while travelling after dark . maybe they 'll improve upon that in the next versions
toys	balderdash is a riot ! it keeps my family in stitches ! my entire family is so full of bull we play this easily . playing balderdash is a family tradition after thanksgiving christmas dinners and everything in-between . anytime there is a family gathering the balderdash game comes out ! my grown sons and their wives are full of bull , the grandkids are now joining in , but , it 's tough to out bull the mother of bulls ! got ta love it ! jan
toys	it was impossible to find baby sunglasses in the winter until i found these stunning red infant shades . a plus was there is a soft strap to keep the sunglasses on . our granddaughter looks like a movie star
toys	the description did n't say that the board game was sold separately . i assumed a `` game pack '' had all the necessary materials . it should hae said expansion pack . it did n't , so i had to go buy the original game . it should n't be called wb 50th anniversary , it should be called `` scene it - friends version . '' we played one full round with 2 teams and literally half of the questions had to do with the friends tv show . all in all , i was very disappointed with this product .
toys	i purchased this for my sons birthday this year . he is three . he was so excited to have the play tent but when i took it out of the box and started to put it together i noticed the stitching was not straight and missing in some places . it took him no more than 24 hours to brake it . the plastic supports and cheap fabric were horrible . there was also a center support pole with no place to put it . he likes it but the quality craftmanship was a zero .
toys	first i have to say thank you to amazon for having this game . this was on my daughter 's christmas list and amazon was the only place i could find it . second , my daughter loves this game and so do her friends . they have played the game more than any other she received
toys	this product is not the best ever created , as the roxxi doll that comes with it is not the prettiest of bratz dolls . she has huge black and red streaks in her hair , as well as an oddly-shaped head . however , one gets used to her and can even find her pretty . the stage itself is a great product , but plugging it in to your stereo is more confusing than you might think . this playset comes with a microphone that is different from the regular rock angelz microphone , as it is gray and of a different style . also included is a faux-snakeskin chair , roxxi , a guitar , and a few accessories , like bottled water and make up compacts . the stage itself is rather nice , and i strongly suggest the instrumentz if you buy this . however , be warned that it is not the best of bratz products , despite its appeal . it 's rather nice , though . :
toys	great idea to hang clothes . the hangers are not long enough to keep the clothes on . if your child is like mine who loves to dress and re-dress dolls , the armoire is not big enough if you purchase more then 3 outfits . the price is great now . i paid $ 20 . great item just wish it was a little bigger maybe even a drawer .
toys	i purchased this for my eight year old niece . we were both disappointed when it broke after only two weeks . be prepared to have limited options for fun without downloading it on your computer . the program takes up a lot of memory on your computer 's hard drive
toys	3 of my friends ' sons have had this tractor . all 3 have complained of the tires popping right off , exposing the wire that connects the 2 together . i figured maybe it was because they bought them from another retailer or something , maybe rough housing ? though our sons are 2 , they 're truly not rough with these much cherished cars toys ! : ) anyway , bought mine from the disney store for [ ... ] 2 days later , after watching my son simply watch the movie w/the tractor , play randomly w/it- nothing crazy- the tire popped right off . thank god i noticed before my other son , who is 15 months old ! good luck with this one- i 'm on my way to write the company on this disastrous dangerous product- do n't purchase is my advice , unless you want a sort of rental toy ( it will break within days
toys	i had high hopes for this game , but played it with a friend last night and was appalled at the number of confusing questions and just plain incorrect answers . for example , one question asks , `` which of these animals is not found exclusively in south america : ( a ) chinchilla , ( b ) sloth , ( c ) guinea pig , ( d ) spring buck '' . ruling out zoos , my friend reasoned that since zillions of kids in the us have pet guinea pigs , the answer must be c. alas , no ; the correct answer is `` ( d ) spring buck '' with no explanation . did they mean animals in their natural habitat ? we are n't sure . the question is not clearly written . another question asks , `` the word `berserk ' is derived from : ( a ) a norse god ; ( b ) the german for `crazy life ' , ( c ) a tropical plant '' . i read this to my friend and said , `` none of these is the right answer . '' the word `berserk ' comes from the germanic branch of the language tree and means `bear-shirt ' . the game says the correct answer is `` a norse god . in norse mythology , the god `berserker ' always fought in a state of frenzy . '' there is no such norse god . who wrote these questions ? one of the aspects of trivia games that i enjoy is the prospect of learning something in the process of playing ; this game concerns me because i do not know which answers are incorrect . from a learning standpoint , the badly written questions and poorly researched answers make this a frustrating and intellectually dangerous game .
toys	pros : very cool toy/model for a 12+ with extra time on their hands . cons : too many microscopic pieces to count . very little room for open play . requires extreme caution playing with it because the propeller and other pieces fall apart at the slightest breath . not appropriate for under 7 , at least . first just let me say that my son loves the lego duplo blocks and spends hours creating all kinds of different designs with them . he has been begging for the `` big boy '' legos , and i have been turning him down , pointing out the recommended ages on the box , ( knowing that i would be picking up infinite numbers of tiny pieces throughout the house for the next 18+ years ) . the ages they put on the box seem to be purely arbitrary , based on this particular toy . a well-meaning relative decided to bless him with this present on his 5th birthday . ( i will be seeking revenge as soon as they have children . ) i spent the next several hours constructing this nightmare , which in and of itself defeats the purpose of a building toy , in my opinion . i have no idea where they have the idea that this is appropriate for a 5-year-old , given that it was a challenge for me to put this together . given the amount of microscopic pieces in this toy , one has to wonder who designs these things and if they have children of their own . so much of it seems purely sadistic . when the helicopter was finally assembled ( and i warned him that that was the one and only time i was putting it together ) , my son spent some time playing with it , only to be constantly frustrated by the fact that pieces were constantly popping off , particularly the propeller , and this was with very gentle play . bottom line , if you have a child under 10 , they would probably have many more hours of play if you just bought a lot of inexpensively priced lego blocks ( of various types ) that they could make into all kinds of different designs . these expensively priced city lines and the like are really neat once built , but then it 's just like a very fragile model . once you 've spent the time constructing it , you really do n't want to take it apart , so i 'm not really sure why you would buy this over a traditional model . i guess i miss the point .
toys	my 8 year old son loves this toy . he has spent many hours acting out the cartoon and loves that fact that the cape pops out at the push of a button and winds back in by moving a leg back and forth . he likes the food dish that shoots the disc . and also thinks the cryptonite is cool ! ! ! it says it changes colors when warm , but we havent seen that . maybe nn to run it under hot/cold water ? ! overall a fantastic buy
toys	we bought this item for my daughter 's christmas present and the strings do not work at all . all it does is play the 3 songs , and the microphone works . but the other functions ( anything to do with the strings ) do not work at all . we bought this at toys r us and we 're taking it back tomorrow . as i can see from the reviews ( which i wish i 'd read earlier ) , we 'll be getting a different brand of guitar . these seem faulty as a rule . do not buy this
toys	as others have stated the dvd mini-games are nearly impossible to play due to wonky controls . i also have no idea what the cards or pieces are for , other then they may come into play if you `` win '' the main game . they should have just done a choose your own adventure type game . it would have been less high-tech , but you could at least have a laugh when you choose `` set up a perimeter '' and the terrorists once again escape . do not buy
toys	i like that everything fits in the case . my 2 year old enjoys dumping all the pieces on the floor . no big deal . you can also store a few parts in the potato and take it with you . very happy with purchase
toys	this was the best stocking stuffer ever . and we got 4 . one for each of us . mine is know at my office , and my boss loves it
toys	we use this travel turtle on the airplane and in the car for my 1- and 2-year old children . it 's intended for children a little older , and i can see why , as they are not able to easily balance the turtle on their laps . however , my 2-year-old can use it by herself , and it helped her to have a flat place to color and play with her magnetic board toys . i had to hold it in place for my 1-year-old , but when doing so , it also allowed him to color . i would recommend it , especially for children 3 and up .
toys	unavailable for some time , the sky high suspension bridge is back . once you have the ramps to get the track up there , it really stands out as a part of the railroad . assembly was required but routine ; the directions were quite adequate . there are no stickers to wiggle into place
toys	bought this for my 6 month grandson . worked about 1 week then quit . have changed batteries but still does n't work . guess it was too good to be true ! spend your money on another crib toy
toys	wonderful product . we bought this as a gift for my son 's 7th birthday as a fun incentive to get him a little writing and spelling practice . he loved to make his own books at home with computer paper and the stapler , so a real book was a huge hit . he thought this was great because it is a real bound book with his own words and pictures . his book will be a cherished keepsake and i 'm sure it will be great fun to look at when he is grown
toys	well , this is the expansion for settlers of catan , and a lot of things have changed . the ability to build military forces adds depth to the game , as does the city improvements . the abundance of new cards is worth it if for the beautiful illustrations alone . the expansion makes the game a little bit longer to play , but it still should finish out well inside two and a half hours . my only complaint is that in several games , the barbarians have not beaten us once , they are way too easy . however , this is minor and can be remedied with a house rule of your own . all in all , this makes a great game totally awesome
toys	based on the other reviews , this grandmother decided to buy this particular playhouse for my grandson 's first birthday present ! i am not the least bit disappointed . colorful , action packed activities everywhere , sturdy , easy to assemble , cold weather friendly and perfect for the little boys in your life ! there are a lot of girlie playhouses , but this one is the answer for boys . my son put it together in about an hour , and was ready for the birthday party guests . happy grandmother
toys	i purchased this as a christmas gift for my 1 year old nephew . very pleased with the online price through toys-r-us and amazon.com , it was $ 50.00 less than in a retail store ! very prompt shipping , had to be put together but not difficult with common household tools . very nice quality wagon , top of the line and well worth the money . rubber tires give a more comfortable ride for small children . i also purchased the pad set . fits perfectly , looks great nad comfy ride , but be sure to purchase the pad set for the model # 29 all-terrain cargo wagon ( bp-29 ) , as other pad sets will not fit ! very nice onverall . do n't hesitate to buy !
toys	i was torn at what remote control car to buy my 4 year old son . the sales clerk at the disney store could n't say enough about this car , my son is a huge `` cars '' fan -- i was sold ! ! it never worked , it just jerked a little bit ! my 2 year olds fisher price car works a lot better for a third of the price . now i got the boys fighting over the baby car and do n't even ask for lightning mcqueen . i am going back to the store and get my money back . do not waste your time on this toy ! ! thank you .
toys	it was neat to be able to make `` cotton candy '' at home , however , the machine only makes a very small amount at a time , so it is a lot of work for not much enjoyment . it takes an adult to run the machine and watch over it since it gets hot . then it cools for almost 10 minutes . it does n't even come with the sugar needed ! the product should list it on the outside of the box..sugar not included ! then you have to clean it ( adult only ) it would not buy it again.this review will not mark a 1 for educational value . it keeps giving it a 2 and i put a one ( fyi
toys	i originally bought this for my husband , an emt/ff . i wrote a poor review of company , based upon my entire experience w/ this storefront , and the other items i had purchased . i was n't terribly pleased with the [ ... ] pen but my husband took it to work and loved it . said it went off several times from pocket while driving..and the entire er loved it . overall , it is fun and writes and does what it 's supposed to : make you laugh
toys	why should i buy anything from amazon when they allow price gouging by third-party retailers
toys	i wrote some reviews of lila doll saying she is my favorite but this one is extremly pretty . her face is so pretty and all her clothes and cute . i say diffrent , i say that lila is better than polly ! lila also comes with a cute horse and carrige . wow how can you think spending 25 dollars on polly will be better when you can spent less than 10 dollars on lila and get a real cute and worth-the-money doll
toys	we tried adding the soap and turned the handlle `` really fast '' but it still dosent do much ? ?
toys	we had a blast making up our on questions and playing this game . the guys played it and the guys never want to play games
toys	being a preschool teacher i use these all of the time . i have found that taking the sheets out individually clipping them to the easels clip to be the best way to work with them . even if you do n't have an easel these are wonderful for children of all ages . large , unlined sheets of paper encourage children to be creative and to express themselves in a completely original way . for infants , toddlers , and preschoolers i will often tape the sheets to the table and let them color/paint/glue to their hearts delight
toys	we 've had a number of gazillion bubble machines . the first - this one , with an upright rotating set of bubble wands - worked relatively well , but stopped working after maybe a dozen uses . ( granted , one of those uses was for a few hours ) . when the level of liquid is low , the machine stops making bubbles since it has to pick up enough liquid to cover the wand . we replaced it the next year with the typhoon machine - this was awesome , produced a huge quantity of bubbles and worked more reliably since the bubble liquid is sucked up and put on the wands , no matter how low the supply of liquid . it has a large reservoir at the bottom so you do n't need to fill it very often - it takes a lot of liquid though . our issue now is getting the liquid . gazillion liquid does produce the best bubbles - they last well , etc . etc . etc . however , very few stores stock the liquid , and except for when i first bought the first machine , no-one stocks large size bottles . even the online vendors like toys.com who are supposed to have them , never have them in stock ( i 've been on their notify list for a long time ! ) i 've ended up buying from someone in canada on ebay - otherwise , buying the smaller bottles at toysrus , target , etc . is just too expensive . both of these machines do n't really work if you try other bubble liquids - other liquids ( especially the cheaper kinds in very large size bottles ) are much thinner and the liquid drips right off the wands before it has a chance to pass by the blower part to make any bubbles . we 're planning to start making our own bubble liquid and hopefully that will cover us . otherwise , the machines are useless now .
toys	do n't waste your time with this thing . by the time we invested in the toy , the batteries , etc . we had quite a few dollars into it ... for about 15 minutes of fun . the toy ca n't just be set down on a table , so when my son actually gone bored with it ( to my shock because he loves bubbles ) he tried to set it down and it spilled the remaining gold solution all over . yuck . mommy promptly threw the toy in the trash . this toy is just a gimmick - stick with the good old magic bubbles and save your money
toys	these blocks are so great ! they 've gone through their different stages of growth . they learned to reach for them , peek inside , grasp them , toss them around and now stacking them to make towers . my triplets are 20 mos and have had them for about a year . love them all
toys	my wife and i purchased the videonow xp interactive video system for my son this christmas however when we did walmart was out of the headphones . well i was on amazon one day and decided to look here . i ordered them and was seriously disappointed when they arrived . my 5 year old son attempted to put them on and all they did was fall to his shoulders . no matter how we tried that is all they would do . my 12 year old daughter decided to try them with her mp3 player with the same result ! i am able to wear them however even with my 30 year old head ( size 8 1/4 ) it is still loose . these are not adjustable which of course makes things all the worse . i would just go ahead and pick up some other company 's aftermarket headphones for your child . if tiger reads the reviews of their products at all then they need to ensure that they rethink the engineering of this device
toys	do not like this product at all ... the girls on the video are not facing the right way for easy instruction ... we have to go the opposite way ... very uncool ... my daughter started crying , too ... i told her it was n't her fault ... you want your child to feel good about themselves and all it does is make them feel like they are n't good enough ... do not waste your money
toys	i bought this set for my son prior to reading the other reviews online but before i tried to set it up . i will admit in reading the reviews about how difficult some people thought it was to put together that they must be exaggerating ... we 'll apparently they were not . i tried for 10 minutes and was covered in soap and nearly hurt myself trying to get the first two pieces together ... so at that point i gave up and waited for my husbands help . the two of us spent nearly an hour banging the thing together with every tool we had ( after we washed off all the soap b/c that just made getting the pieces to stay together impossible ) and once we had the center base up i pushed it and it fell completely apart . we got it back together but there was no way i felt it was sturdy enought to let my child anywhere near it . so in desperation i called the toysrus store where i got it and spoke w/ the store manager . she assured me that this was not how it was supposed to be and that i should bring it back . i wasnt thrilled about that b/c it wasnt the easiest thing to get home in the first place ... but what choice did i have . i asked her if they would set the next one up for me to make sure it worked b/c i was n't about to go through this again . when i arrived at the store it was all set up and completely sturdy ... exactly what i had wanted it to be when i had purchased it . unfortunatly due to its size we had to take it back apart to get it home but once we did my husband had it back together in about 10-15 minutes with just a little banging from a rubber mallett ... just like some of the other reviewers had said . so the morale of the story is ... if its miserable to put together then its probably defective and should go back ... but once its together properly its great ... .now if my son would just show some interest in the darn thing all would be good with the world !
toys	even though i dont have this i think is the most cutest thing i have ever seen
toys	my brother , the uncle of my two sons , purchased this item for christams . in the excitement of testing this item out they realized the battery backing was not able to be opened . the screw casing was stripped ! no big deal , i thought , i would just call the company . they are not willing to replace the prodect unless i pay for shipping . they recomeded that i take it to a local store to replace knowing that it was purchased over 1000 miles away and not at a chain store ! passing the buck . i then asked to speak to a super visor and she repeated the same mantra , `` sorry company policey . '' i never go to the lengths that i am now , but i am tired of companies not performing the basic duties of customer satisfaction . they want me to go to the post office and mail it to them at which time they will determine whose fault it is and then mail me a new one . when i asked if there was any way around said policy the manager told me i could write a letter . so here it is
toys	kids played it one time and have n't touched it since . bought the extra tower attachment which was a complete waste of money .
toys	my 4 year old son loves all things rescue hero ! his grandparents got the macc for him almost a year ago now . i run an in home day care , so i watch not only my son but 2 other 5 year old boys and my youngest son , 13 mo and a 10 mo old boy ! they all love it ! this thing has stood up to all of their adventures ! one of the kids i watch was thrilled when he got the same macc for his birthday from his parents ! he had just went on and on about it , and they could n't resist . it is very large , but we already had the firetruck , police car , helecoptor and about 30 rescue heroes , so , in the words of my son , we just had to get this too ! i highly recommend this toy for all ages ! great imaginary play
toys	i really like my first leap pad and so does my 3 year old son . i bought it for him for christmas last year ( he was 2 1/2 then ) and though some the activities we 're alittle hard for him to start with , there were still plenty of things he could do with it.every picture you touch the pen on says a frase/says the name of the object or make a sound , so even without playing the games he still had great fun with it . a year on , he can now play all the games on it and has recently noticed letters make words , so now he touches the words and the leap pad reads it for him , so he is still learning from this toy after a year ! i will be buying more my first leap pad books for him this christmas , this toy is worth every penny
toys	i purchased this toy for my 2 year old son . he absolutely loves it ! he had played with it before because his older cousin has one . i had searched in stores around me wanting to buy it but no one had it . sure enough i found it on amazon . it 's a lot of fun to play with and he just loves to rock out with it . i definately recommend this toy
toys	dude this looks cool but plays crappy -pretty cheap plastic , mechanics are lame . you cant really tell when superman is hit because his head barely leans back . you have to constantly adjust the arm positions of the figures so their reach can strike the head or chest targets -and it seems rigged that supermans arms are just a little longer to stack the odds for truth , justice and the american way . again , cool figures weak cheap playability
toys	my daughter has trouble concentrating in school . i got this for her birthday and her grades instantly improved to the point where her teacher stated that there was a noticable improvement in all areas of her work . the best thing about it is that i do n't have to tell her to use it because she loves it . i told her it 's just like having a laptop because she always wanted a computer of her own . this is as close as i 'm willing to get concenrning her having her own computer at her age , plus it 's a minute fraction of the price of a personal laptop . for children who do n't have a hard time in school , this may not be for them but for my daughter it is a whole lot of what i needed to help me help her learn . i just wish i could find an adapter .
toys	fun for kids age 4 -40 . bought it as a gag for my college age son ... he loved it for pranks , but also let young nieces and nephews play with it . kept them laughing for a long time .
toys	i think that the new style of the people are not as nice and durable as the old ones
toys	my girls were given this game a couple years ago . . .ages 2 and 3 . they crack up over the voices and play it still . i like it also b/c it 's so darn cute
toys	this is the first time i 'm writing a review of anything on amazon.com , but i need to warn people about this game . it would be great except for 2 problems : 1 . it skip excessively . 2 . there is no way to easily skip past games that you 've played . so once you 've taken out that dvd , put it back in and you 'll recognize the questions -- you 've answered them already ! not recommended . if i could give it negative stars , i would . however , amazon makes you give it at least 1
toys	i bought this house for my daughter who will be 3 in 2 month 's . i did a lot of research and was torn between the twin town house and this one the loving family sweet sound 's house . at first i almost went with the my first doll house by fisher price but was told by a friend she would proberly grow out of that fast and she was right . this house the sweet sound 's is a perfect size for her and i know she will get quite a few year 's out of it . yes the furniture is impossible to find . after reading the review 's i did n't look for it much knowing i would never find it . i ended up buying her the twin town 's bathroom and a few pieces from the my first doll house by fisher price . the pieces work perfect together and are chunkier for her and not so many tiny pieces . they work great with the doll 's that come with it too . i did also purchase one doll set from twin town house . the house does make some sound 's with just the pieces that come with it , they are cute and my daughter does n't know any better that it would make more if we could of found the correct sweet sounds furniture . she 's happy with the way it is . i decided against the twin town because i agreed with some reviewers after looking at it that the room 's were too tiny . yes you get more room 's but my daughter i know would get so frusterated with alway 's knocking the furniture over in those tiny room 's . this house has big room 's . it fold 's up easy in half but not so good when it is filled with furniture . we leave it open anyway 's so that is not a big deal . it was easy put together but the sticker 's took about and hour to put on . also a note make sure and put the battery in before you fill it with furniture , i put the battery in last and ended up spilling the furniture everywhere . also i did n't see any one mention the front door . i am not really sure why but it does n't open from the outside , only from the inside . you can open it from the outside but you have to pull it very hard and really are n't supose to open it that way . why not be able to open it both way 's ? ? ? i guess their thinking is so if you are moving it so the door does n't swing open but they could of put a little latch on it so you could of closed it shut when you wanted . also i am not sure what room is supose to be the bathroom . i think it is either the bedroom or above that which i thought was the kid 's playroom . i ended up putting the bathroom in the right side of the bathroom . all in all i think is is a great doll house and i would recommend it
toys	this was a gift to my grand sons ( 10 7 ) . they were well pleased with it . the 10 year old has joined a chess club after school .
toys	at first this case seemed like a good idea , but after the 3rd use , the zipper broke . since the case does not stay open on its own , there is tendency to push the case open and force the zipper backward and apart . after fixing it a couple of times , it is now permanently broken . bad design . maybe velcro would have been better
toys	along this is not the most exhilirating toy . however , my son has collected many of the toy story toys and enjoys playing with all of them together . for any child who does this you need to have slinky do
toys	this game has zero replay value . once you play the three episodes , you 're done . each run through of each episode is the same . played through the entire disc in an hour and half . my advice : spend a few dollars more and get scene it !
toys	i picked this item up for my 6 year old nephew who loves science . we put it together one night and i was surprised to find that the base and volcano are incredibly thin plastic that crack under any pressure at all . the plaster/sand mixture was impossible to work with , it just balled up into clumps and there was no real way of spreading it around smoothly . we both ended up with plaster all over us . once it had dried , he was excited to get to paint it . as soon as he began to paint , parts of the plaster started breaking off in chunks . hooking the plastic tubing up was not a major problem but i had issues keeping it hooked together . the `` pump '' system was supposed to send vinegar into a baking soda chamber to push up into the volcano . instead the `` pump '' ( which was a squeeze bottle ) pushed the vinegar weakly upwards and then once it hit the baking soda chamber it clogged up . when it finally made its way out through the volcano after me squeezing the bottle as hard as possible , it barely trickled out . once it had trickled enough , the rest of the plaster fell off as it got wet . he and his sisters just looked at me and asked `` is that it ? '' after three tries we trashed the whole thing . also , the `` rock samples '' that they give you in the kit are the size of the tip of your fingernail . i 'm a geologist and these are not rare , expensive rocks . there was no reason to not include larger samples . he was very disappointed in the whole thing and so was i. i ca n't believe that the smithsonian put their name on this product . we 'll go back to our plaster volcano with vinegar and baking soda
toys	my son received this as a christmas gift . he and his brother and dad were excited ... got all set up to build it ... and got nothing but frustration ! these are really mechanically minded guys too . very disappointing . i was especially surprised because of the smithsonian name on it -- you 'd think they would test this stuff before allowing their name on it . my guys never got as far as the reviewer who eventually got it assembled . the screws stripped and we did n't have the appropriate glue to even attempt a rescue . it simply would not assemble the way it was advertised . i am calling amazon tomorrow about a refund .
toys	toy makes extremely loud animal noises , along with a screeching motor when backing up or at top speed going forward . my son enjoyed the heck out of it for about 2 minutes before my wife said it was going back to the store , which is exactly what i was thinking . at least 3-4x louder than any other toy i 've ever seen , let alone purchased . also when performing its `` flip '' maneuver , it gets stuck 70 % of the time and then makes the same screeching motor sound while it repeatedly tries to reset its `` flip arm '' . might be okay for just outside use if you can stand a lot of high pitched noise . controller was extremely toddler friendly compared to other rc toys . toy also seemed fairly tough .
toys	this is really fun for adults . we get together once a month and we really enjoy the company , the food and the spirits . this was meant for adults to solicize not for children . i am sure they might learn somehting at another gathering . i have really enjoyed bunco .
toys	this toys purpose is to sort your change , and it performs poorly . in mine , the quarters get stuck unless you pour coins in one by one , which takes forever . if you pour more than one coin in they get stuck or little coins fall into the slots for bigger coins . in mine the quarter got stuck in the dime slot blocking it , it no longer works
toys	you know the family games that you regret buying , especially when you see your child coming at you with it on a rainy day , saying , `` will you play this with me ? '' well , rat-a-tat-cat is not one of these . it 's simple enough to learn , but there is enough challenge in it to keep even an adult guessing . rat-a-tat-cat was a gift to our family , but when my youngest daughter ( age 4 or 5 at the time ) got the hang of it , it became her favourite and here 's why : 1 ) though she was just learning numbers , she could understand the game , 2 ) the guessing part of the game put her on equal par with adults , to her delight . 3 ) even for a busy adult , it 's easy enough to sit down and play this game and actually can be relaxing . 4 ) if a guest came over , my daughter was able to explain the game rules to the guest and soon she 'd have even teenage guys sitting cross-legged on the floor trying to get rid of the rats . good ice-breaker . simply put , rats are bad , cats are good . high points ~ you do n't want them . the higher the number on the card , the more rat-power in the drawing . zero is the best , with rats gone and a cat installed as a happy statue of liberty . the drawings are whimsical clever . the reason it 's a success as a game for all ages is because though it appears simple , there is the element of not knowing what your cards are and even if you peek ( with permission ) , opponents can take your best away from you . so , if you do n't mind losing to a kid and making that kid 's day , as well as having a laugh , go ahead and get this game . my daughter is older now and we still play it . she 's also learned to be a good loser : -
toys	my daughter , 6 , received this for christmas . her 4-year-old brother also wanted to play with it . the first problem is that there are no instructions included for how to put it together . this is a problem when you have two antsy kids eager to play with it . i was struggling with getting the various panels to snap together solidly when , after repeated attempts , i happened to look in the drawer underneath the colored bulbs and crayons , and found -- what do you know ! -- screws . then , after i put on the top , i realized i should have installed the light bulb first ( you need a light bulb of 25 watts or less , not included ) . then , when i thought i was done , i found i had a piece left over . arrgh ! that extra piece was a clip that is supposed to hold a picture for tracing . ha ! even after i installed it , there 's no tension on the clip and very little chance that it will hold anything . there are two drawers to hold the bulbs and crayons . good idea . but for some reason the drawers catch and stick . how hard can it be to make drawers that slide easily in and out ?
toys	i thought this would be fun , but ended up in garbage after 2 days . fighters dont stay in place and dont really move well . very hard to hit at other playe
toys	i would give this kit zero stars if i could . the instructions say that it takes 6-8 weeks for the seeds to sprout . i kept them in moist peat and warm temperatures for over three months after the recommended period of refrigeration . not a single seed sprouted . i finally had to throw out the whole kit when mold took over . complete waste of time and money . but if you 're feeling lucky , you should know that most of the seeds in this kit are n't much bigger than pinheads , and they all come packaged together in the same tiny plastic bag . so if you want to have each type of plant growing in a different section of the plastic tray provided in the kit - like that shown on the box cover - you need to separate out each seed under a strong magnifying glass . and even then you wo n't be successful , as most of these seeds look just like ground pepper . i accidentally spilled a few on the floor , and after sweeping them all up i literally could n't tell them from the other debris in the dustpan . by the way , it takes a minimum of 6-8 years living in ideal growing conditions for any of the plants in this kit to reach the sizes shown on the box cover . these are not plants that can simply be put on a windowsill . they need an environment that is not easily provided in the average home - lots of very bright light ( about 15 hours a day ) , lots of humidity , an acidic growth medium ( such as sphagnum moss ) , and about 80 degrees . and even then , these are very slow-growing plants . to keep the humidity level high , you 'll need some kind of terrarium , preferably covered to keep the humidity level high . but if you use incandescent bulbs to provide the necessary level of light , the amount of heat they produce can easily raise the temperature to lethal levels . for this reason i recommend a combination of fluorescent bulbs and a moist/dry heating pad at the bottom . be sure that whatever heating pad you use is n't the type that shuts off automatically after one hour of use . some warnings ... these plants flourish only in a very limited range of environments and nourishment . the care you would normally give a houseplant will - in all likelihood - kill these plants : never feed them animal protein ( like hamburger ) . the fats in meat are n't digestible and can kill them . never use tap water to water them . the mineral build-up can kill them so use distilled water only . never feed them insects that have been killed by insecticides , like raid . carnivorous plants should be fed soft-bodies insects like small slugs , ants , termites , etc. , rather than hard-shelled insects such as beetles . well-stocked pet stores will carry dried mealworms , but even these will need to be cut into very small pieces . just as a baby needs tiny mouthfuls of food , so too do venus flytraps . never fertilize them . these are very slow-growing plants and any attempt to force them to grow will kill them .
toys	the build a figure ( baf ) program of marvel legends keeps on rocking . this time build a giant 14 '' apocalypse . this baf is big and cool , super articulated , with sculpt and paint fine enough to be a sculpture . for apocalypse 5 stars . for iron fist ... well he 's super articulated and does come with the mighty booty ( that 's the buttocks ) of apocalypse , but really is the weakest figure in this series . a lot of that is just charater design though . green tights with an open v-neck green shirt , and what is that tattoo supposed to be anyway , ballet slippers and a dew-rag ? pretty horrible looking . if you can , try to find the red suit variant , at least that 's a little cool . also , the accesories ( besides the booty ) are two rubbery flames to fit into his hands to give a fire fist effect . good luck with that . they are kind of flimsy and hard to place in the hands . once you get them in you better not touch the figure again or they will fall off . overall , not the quatlity of figure or accesories i 'd expect . but the rest of the figures in the series will make up for this one , plus you do still get that booty
toys	complete waste of money ! i bought this for my 5yr old daugther and there is no way possible for her to program it ! after several frustrating attempts we finally get it programed . now the darn thing does not respond to her answers . even when i clearly repeat the answer in her ear she does not seem to register . complete waste of money ! ! ! ! would not recommend to anyone ! save your money and play with a rock , much more fun
toys	this was my first schleich world of knights figure , given to me christmas of this year . it 's a highly detailed classic dragon , with no moving or detachable parts ( the wings are an integral part of the figure ) . as such , it 's safe for very young children , and you do n't have to worry about someone 's eye getting put out . as to its historical accuracy and educational value , i really can not say , never having seen dragons in the wild , but the level of detail is wonderful , and it should encourage children to obtain the more `` practical '' members of the balance of scheich world of knights collection , which are excellent , as well
toys	my almost 5 year old daughter loves this toy . it is easy for her to control . my 8 year old thinks it is boring . i do n't think it has any educational value . the controller has a long pointed antenna with a plastic rounded end , so the kids have to be careful not to poke each other with it .
toys	bought this product for my two sons ages 4 and 6 . within the first week one of the sticks was broken . called the company and they sent out another one , but before it could arrive the other stick broke . they are n't made strong enough to use . they plastic simply cracks and totally falls apart . we ended up throwing it out
toys	i am a breast cancer survivor and i find this pink dressed , blond `` doll '' of perfection rather insulting to my female self , the perfect perky boobs , the long blond hair , the body that does not exist on a woman after the ravages of chemotheraphy . i can perfectly understand mattel wanting to support breast cancer research and donate a portion of proceedes towards funding ( and thank you for your generosity ) , but to do it under the guise of selling a `` doll '' which does not reflect the community of women who have experienced the challenges of recovery and survivorship ... a doll which does not look like a survivor is literally painful and insulting ! why does n't this doll have a wig ? why does n't she have a breast removed ? why does n't she have a bra fitted with a form to mimic the shape of a breast ? what is wrong with reality ? why ca n't mattel acknowledge the true nature of this disease and make a doll which comforts , not insults the sensibility of women who have suffered from this disease . i will purchase this doll , just because i am horrified by the product itself . i will disrobe her , and with a saw , cut off her breast so that she will look more like me , a survivor , a woman of pride . i will dismantle the construct of supposed beauty and make this image more like my own - because i am what is woman , not the facade of a false construction .
toys	my 3-year-old son liked floam because of the goop factor , but unfortunately the goop the little foam pellets are suspended in seems to be a great medium for growing mold . this happened to us twice ( despite clean hands/work space ) so we gave up on it entirely . i suggest you try playfoam instead . it 's also available here on amazon , or at lakeshore learning store ( look for samples at the checkout for 49 cents ! ) playfoam has a nicer consistency , less sticky ( but still moldable ) and no odor
toys	this doll is absolutely breathtaking . i bought her for my `` gift closet '' , but i think i 'll keep her for myself ! the price was only $ 5.29 during the special toys r us sale , plus free shipping . could n't ask for a better deal or a prettier collectible doll
toys	in boggle , players compete against one another and a 3-minute hourglass to find word combinations across randomly distibuted letter cubes on a 4x4 grid . the game develops pattern recognition skills , and because most possible words are only three or four letters long , astute younger players can play adults without too much of s handicap . tactics learned playing boggle translate well into success at scrabble and other word games , while the clock management skills help with chess and test taking . boggle is lightweight and makes a good travel game , though you might want to bring a zipper-lock sandwich bag to avoid losing the letter cubes . as an added plus , the game can be played solitaire with minimal dropoff in entertainment value . if you enjoy boggle , you might want to seek out big boggle , which uses a 5-by-5 grid ( 56 % more cubes ) . words and time limit are both longer .
toys	my friend got this toy for me saying it was the best , and because i 'm a dancer . when i opened it , the doll 's head fell off and when i dropped it , it broke . i suggest instead going to a real studio , because this was a waste of my friends money .
toys	i chose this railway set over learning curve because i believe their prices are inflated , and i was not disappointed with it . the set is well made overall , with smooth , well-fitting track and sturdy accessories . my son ( 3 ) and daughter ( 6 ) have played with the set for hours every day since we got it , both with equal fascination . it fits perfectly with thomas accessories we already own . i have only three small caveats : 1 ) buy some `` sure track '' clips to use on elevated portions of the track . we use it on a smooth , level surface ( hardwood floor ) , but the clips really enhance the stability for active play . 2 ) the round turntable did not spin freely when we got it , because the blue center piece was not perfectly round . we drilled out the rivet and removed the blue center piece , sanded down the edges , and replaced it . now it 's very easy for my kids to operate . 3 ) the trains included have slightly wobbly wheels , compared to thomas trains . but they are functional , and my kids use the trains interchangeably . it 's a great set , and a real bargain
toys	i bought this for my nine year old daughter . the game in theory is great , but ours does not work right , and the company is not real great to deal with . i am still trying to get a replacement . if the game worked properly , i would rate it 5 stars , easily . even my thirteen year old daughter loves it
toys	while the doll is beautiful , i do n't think she is a good representation of chinese people because if you look at the picture of a close up of her face , you can see that her eyes are big and round just like a european . her nose also is upturned . while some may say that some asians do have rounder eyes , most do not and i do n't think this doll looks chinese enough
toys	i bought her because martina mcbride is my favorite singer and then my lil sis gotm madded and she chopped of the head ~7 year old
toys	my daughter ( 3 at the time ) received this as a christmas present and it took her all of 10 minutes to memorize where the pieces belong thus ending the usefulness of the game . the game itself only comes with 12 puzzle pairs ( 24 total pieces ) . i would avoid this game entirely .
toys	when it first came out almost 20 years ago , i saw this game at a bookstore and bought it to take on a christmas skiing vacation with my family . unfortunately , my mother ended up having emergency gallbladder surgery instead . we did n't have gifts that year , but we did made it to colorado and spent hours by the fire laughing until our ribs ached playing this crazy game . it does n't matter if you can draw , it 's how fast you can put something down that halfway suggests the word they give you , and how ridiculous everyone 's scribblings usually look . i 've played it with an artist . he could n't even draw a nose and chin in the 20 seconds he had , so his artistic standards took a dramatic tumble . if my spirits need a boost , i play this game . buy it . you 'll love it
toys	at first it was confusing but after you get it , it is sooo much fun . and it 's great for keeping your brothers out of the room
toys	back in the day ( 1970 's ) these were made with a stiff , strong plastic , rigid `` insert '' w/ the poly-rope outside . this gave the `` leash '' a realistic , `` tight but curved under own weight '' appearance , a believable / realistic `` bounce '' to the `` dog '' with the most imperceptible wrist action on the part of the `` dog walker '' . however , this piece of crap has a thick soft wire inside the leash , and this gives the leash a very phony , fake-looking , too-heavy , all bent-up look . piece of junk piece of junk piece of junk !
toys	if you are a hardcore family guy fan like me ( i am actually one of the few people that watched family guy when it was originally on the air ) , you will not be disappointed with this monopoly version . the box is beautifully designed with the griffin family pictured on center , and some easter eggs to look around for . the board is not the most impressive one especially compared to the simpson 's and muppets monopoly versions but it is pretty nice with the griffins at center . what you will love of the board is the properties , which include everything from chris ' closet and seamus ' lighthouse to james woods high and geronimo 's palace to the clam and channel 5 news to mayor west 's mansion and finally petoria , all from both old and new seasons plus some scenes from the stewie 's untold story movie . the property deeds are somewhat disappointing though . the do not have color watermarks like those found in the simpson 's version , but i guess they will do . peter 's fishing boat , hinden-peter , peter-copter and the pope mobile replace the railroads . i bet you will not be laughing too much when you have to pay $ 200.00 ( income tax ) for volcano insurance or $ 75.00 for workplace sensitivity training ( luxury tax ) but hey , you ca n't stay mad for long at the salesman guy , right ? it would have been cool to have joe swanson on the go to jail space and have a picture of quahog prison on the jail space but well , what can you do ? the pewter tokens are nice . you can chose from tv junkie peter , mug in hand brian , nose picking chris , lois , stewie in a high chair and meg ( who looks like a peanut character ) . you can also order four more tokens that include the giant chicken , quagmire , joe and the evil monkey . the coolest changes are the chance and community chest cards that are replaced by the what the deuce ! and giggity ! giggity ! giggity ! cards , respectively . they are beautifully done in full color and you will find things like ; made sheriff of bumblescum advance to go , get liposuction and implants pay $ 100 , confederate civil war veterans are after you go back 3 spaces , take big fat paulie to the movies as a favor collect $ 25.00 , help death get a girlfriend collect $ 100 , and many more . the money goes as follows $ 1 - meg , $ 5 - chris $ 10 - lois , $ 20 - brian , $ 50 - stewie , $ 100 - peter , $ 500 - the griffins there are no special rules for this version , which is weird since it has been the norm for some time in these special monopoly versions . to wrap it up i must say that even though they could have done a better job this is a beautiful and wonderfully done monopoly game . family guy fans will love it making this a great gift . have fun
toys	i was also discouraged by the reviews but bought it anyway . it was a lot of fun ! while it worked . we experienced the same symptoms as the other reviewers here ... i appreciate the info on how to fix it but should we have to ? it 's too bad because it really is a cute toy and my 2 year old loved it . i would not buy it again . if you are considering purchasing this toy make sure the company has fixed it first
toys	as always a pleaser ! my girls , ages 9 , 8 and 2 have about 8 other sweet streets . they play for hours with them . i also bought her the shopping district and movie theater . they got a big kick out of the music the movie theater played . i would highly recommend sweet streets village gift set and all the other sweet street products ! ! ! !
toys	i bought this for my 4 year old grandson for christmas . we opened it up and sat on the floor and began putting it together . he was excited because he is a lighting mcqueen fan . he got about four pieces of it together and got very frustrated . it would not stay together . the puzzle is junk ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the pieces are not flat and do not interlock so that they stay together . he lost interest and left . i finished it enough so that they were laying together to see the picture - which is very cute . but , no way would they ever all fit together . do not waste your money on this . i also had to retape the corners of the box , as they were all coming apart too . yea for cheap imports . the usa is so much better off for them ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
toys	was a lot smaller than i expected . my daughter had to find a small doll to use that would fit . because she could n't use her best baby doll that she loves to play with she lost interest real quick
toys	i bought this for my grandson for christmas , he was 8 months old . this has been the best learning toy for him , along with entertainment . he has learned how the shapes work and took this on soon . it has also helped him in walking . it is entertaining for me to watch him play with this toy , he has to push the button and play the music before he pushes it . i would actually buy one more for him to have at home with mom and dad . this is well worth the money
toys	there are so many great things about this that i do n't know where to start . availability -- price -- shipping -- the list goes on and on . bottom line is that my daughter is a big care bear fan and it 's impossible to find this bear anywhere else . it arrived quickly , was just as described ( in fact it was softer ) and occupies a place of honor on my daughter 's bed . i give it a 5 , only because that 's the highest . makes a wonderful gift ! !
toys	my little cousin sarah loves this toy . i bought it at wal-mart in springfield . it works with or without water and features realistic sounds . i am now on my way to purchase another for my 6 year old cousin sean
toys	dont waste your money on this one . the picture is cute . but the quailty of the toy isnt any good . the frosting doesnt even stay in the hole and the box is flimsy it would never last with a child . the concept is supposed to be like the game memory , your supposed to turn over the donuts and match the ones with the same frosting . your better off just buying the real memory game . the only thing this is good for is the pretend food concept and even with that it isnt worth this price .
toys	sure wish my mother-in-law had read these reviews before giving this to me for christmas . tried to play it once with my parents , who are also big 24 fans , a few nights later and were sorely disappointed . this game was obviously just shoved out the door to feed off the popularity of 24 the show and not to garner any popularity in its own right . the mini-games were an exercise in extreme frustration . the problem is that the dvd is not ideal for those mini-games . whenever you try to move there are only two subsequent animations : the successful one and the unsuccessful one , which made it seem like it was just moving at random . other than that it seemed like the game was going to be pretty linear , the clue cards contained no useful information , and the board completely superfluous , unless apparently you are masochistic enough to get to the bonus level
toys	i can see from reading the below reviews that i 'm not the only one who hates this thing . what a total waste ! i got it for my little one , remembering how much i ( and every other kid i 've ever known ) loved this toy . well , this version has been made too safe to have any fun on . it barely spins . if you want your toddler to develop amazing upper body strength , then force them to work out on this thing a couple times a day . it 's almost impossible to spin and you never get up any momentum at all . not to mention the loud loud music with no volume control . which i could deal with if the thing was any fun at all
toys	i saw an advertisement for this toy on the tv . i was shocked that they were still selling it ! years ago , my young son got his arm trapped inside the hole where the balls come out . we had called playskool and they had us return it to the store and they sent us a free 'i 'm sorry ' gift . the one pictured on amazon is the dangerous one that many kids have gotten their arms stuck in . if you look on the playskool website , they have a newer version which offers a cover over the hole where kids like to stick their little paws . be sure you get the newer version ! it is a super cute toy , and i am glad they have fixed the problem so many have had
toys	i do n't understand why they are so offensive to people . i am christian , and i lvoe all three midnight dance dolls . i think they are more 'phantom of the opera ' than 'sadistic satinist ' . meygan is my favorite , but yasmin is still beautiful . these dolls are gourgeous
toys	i bought this game for my mom for christmas and we played it ... right now it is in my game closet because i introduced this game to my poker friends and now we have `` pit '' night instead of poker night . we can not stop laughing when we play this game . we bring this to all get-togethers and everyone loves it.i had to buy my mom a new pit game because i take it all the time . this game is soooo much fun , the more people you play with the more fun it is ! ! ! get this game ! !
toys	got this as a fun birthday present for my husband who adores anything star wars . he liked it so much he brought it to work and we now occassionally hear stories about darth potato and the spud troopers waging war on unsuspecting engineers . it 's a great geek toy
toys	is n't barbie supposed to be pretty ? she looks like an ugly prostitute , hands down . i would n't `` wear that to a club '' and neither would any of my friends . her make up is gross , and especially the look on her face says , `` do me now . '' there 's a difference between beauty and over-the-top trashy . you ca n't deny that she looks like a porn-star , which is an industry that is illegal for teenagers who get this doll to participate in , but i guess we 're preparing our youth for this at a younger age now
toys	i bought this toy because amamzon 's price was a great bargin compared to other stores . i would have given this product 5 stars but gave it only 4 because the can is so large and the lincoln logs only fill is maybe half way . there is a lot more room for more logs . 115 sounds like a lot but you are only able to make the one cabin seen on the front . i ended up buying additional logs ( not lincoln logs ) so that me and the kids could build additional buildings and a fence
toys	we purchased this for our 5 year old along with the spy goggles . he immensely enjoyed both . as a matter of fact , the adults were quite taken with it too
toys	this is a must have for your little sweetheart ! my daughter carries this purse around with her everywhere that she goes . it 's quit interesting finding what she has placed in her purse next ; ) the accessories are cute , but she 'd rather use stuff from mommy 's purse . ; ) the purse is oh so cute too , and durable . my daughter is 21 months old , she received this on christmas and has been a favorite since .
toys	i bought this for my daughter for christmas , three days before her first birthday . she loves taking the pieces out , banging them together and recently , putting them in the correct spaces ! the size of the pieces is perfect for a young toddler and the knobs are the right size for her hands . will definately look at melissa and doug puzzles for her again
toys	remember spirograph by kenner you played with as a kid ? this thing hasbro sells under the same name is not that toy . it is obviously of cheap quality , parred down to a handful of `` gears '' , and designed so poorly that it doesnt really work ! stick with the original , which means purchase it used on ebay , but do not buy hasbro 's spirograph .
toys	lego is a great product , unfortunately this one 's just a little too ambitious . my son fell in love with this and begged for it for chanukah , but once we got it put together it would n't stay together to play with . it 's great to make smaller planes with , but the original plane just fell apart under it 's own weight .
toys	put simply , this toy does n't work . or i should say perhaps it would work with really good bubble solution but it does not work with the bubble solution that comes with it . it sort of sputtered some bubble solution out the top but we never got even one full bubble much less the stream of bubbles we were hoping for . luckily my little son never saw the toy and therefore did n't mind when we took it back
toys	the game itself is actully pretty good . you can go through the entire price is right game or you can just go to each section . like if you just wanted to do the pricing games , there 's that option or you can do the showcase showdown etc ... there are times that the graphics of the game lag , which is kind of odd since to me since i was n't playing it on a computer , but on my dvd player . the pricing games are 'random ' but you do tend to get some of the same games more than other games . you can technically play this game by yourself , but it 's obviously going to be more fun the more people you have
toys	i ordered this item and was so excited . it loaded fine . it let me upload files just fine . it was n't until i actually tried to create my pvd that i received errors that shut down the program ( many many many times ... with numerous types of video files ) i double checked the system requirements for the software and my computer checked out fine . the worst thing is that there is no support for the media player . i tried contacting hasbro with no response . i am so dissapointed .
toys	this particular sudoku handheld was not as expected . it has only basic functions and the person i purchased for said it is easier just to do sudoku on line or in the newspaper or in a puzzle book . really inconvenient functions . may be good for young children , but not adults
toys	i purchased this for my eight year old niece . we were both disappointed when it broke after only two weeks . be prepared to have limited options for fun without downloading it on your computer . the program takes up a lot of memory on your computer 's hard drive
toys	if you love the unpredictable , then catch 22 is for you . this game has plenty of social interaction and combines skill with luck in the pursuit of 22 gold tokens . just when i thought i was about to win the game , my boyfriend landed on my game piece and stole all of my tokens . boy , that did not make me happy at all . the key to this game is to use your blocker cubes wisely . the cubes are used to either block an opponents way or safeguard your path to the money . once you use the cubes , you can only retrieve them by landing on a 'collect blocker ' square . you can collect any blocker cube placed on the board , including your opponent 's cubes . i made lots of money selling blocker cubes back to my opponents . we were so addicted to this game that we played it all night long . i highly recommend it , but be prepared to either win big or lose your shirt !
toys	the only good thing about this kit is that your child can get some joy out of painting a few volcanoes on a cheap plastic sheet . but the real promise of this kit -- to see a model volcano erupt -- may not be fulfilled . we followed all the steps and got tripped by a poorly designed base ( above mentioned cheap plastic sheet ) that is extremely difficult to balance on 4 ill-fitting stilts . a poor experience for the kids . the eruption was more of a fizzle . waste of money and time
toys	if it were up to my children , they would rate this stuff 5+ stars . they love it and they are totally entertained with it . it is one of the only times they play quietly without fighting . mom , on the other hand , hates it and you know it is bad when a toy gives mom some free time of peace and quiet and she wants no part of it ! ! ! this stuff sticks to everything and anything-including your children . you ca n't believe the mess it makes . imagine billions of tiny little balls stuck to everything in your house . i confine it to their playroom , but it follows them everywhere they go . you will find it all over your house and in everything-you ca n't escape it . as for the product itself , it definitely does n't dry out , but it also does n't hold together as well as described making it quite difficult to make the objects it claims you can make on the package . once you put colors together it is impossible to separate them out as they are tiny millimeter balls . playdooh may dry out if left out , but it does n't make anywhere near the mess this stuff does and it also molds much better than playfoam ! my advice is to stick with your playdooh
toys	concept was good , but fails because its not constructed well . after 2 months the toy 's electronics went out
toys	this made our 6 year old so happy ! great colors , great markers
toys	this update of the old big wheel style `` green machine '' is made to handle the height , weight and wear and tear of big boys ( and girls , up to the latter 30s have even been caught on it ) , yet the seat is easily adjusted so that the average 5-year-old can reach its pedals . the main cool feature is the dual lever steering . just like with the original hollow model plastic version , pulling on the steering levers in opposite directions sends the machine into a wicked spin-out that kids just ca n't get enough of . yet under the usage of some pretty crazy 6 , 9 and 12 year olds on a steep downhill driveway , the machine has almost always remained three wheels on the ground . so first , i am amazed at the staying play value of this toy . for two years now , it has been the first toy out of the garage every time the door opens . and second , i am amazed at its durability . the 9 year old who uses it reguarly is an evel kneivel who is notorious for breaking my children 's toys left and right , and so far , it has held up without a squeak . this was a million times better value for our hundred spot , than the darn motorized motorcycle we bought a couple years prior for twice that amount which only lasted a year before the gears stripped . definitely consider this for your 5-10 year old boy , even if he already has a two-wheeler . it 's a whole different kind of fun . ***** all the way
toys	while i certainly did n't expect these drum sticks to be whisper-quiet , i found them to be quite loud for little kids ' ears . and there was no volume control . also , i was hoping for a more authentic drum sound that i have found in other toys . i returned them
toys	bought this item for mt son , and he just loves it . he plays with it all the time , from the time he gets home from school until dinner time , and from after dinner until bed time
toys	i bought this for my niece 's 5th birthday , and she loved it ! my nephew ( 8 ) would n't leave her alone , he wanted to ride it . my brother-in-law got on it , and it actually moved him around . it is very durable , thick plastic looks like it will last a while . for the price , if it lasts this summer only , it is worth it
toys	ho ho ho ! ! my 6 year old has been asking for this toy for about 6 months now and today he finally got it . he 's had it for about 5 hours now and is already tired of it . we 've tried no less that 20 different cars and have yet been able to get it to work . the only thing it seems to do consistently is play that obnoxious sound over and over again ( if you know how to turn the sound off , let me know . i 'm ready to remove the batteries or clip the speaker wire ) . do not buy this toy . you 'll be very disappointed in it .
toys	although this new release from barbie looks very much like the real life singer , the doll itself is not something i would recommend for a child under 12 . the doll is dressed pretty sccantilly and is adorned with realistic jewlerly . it also comes with a bracelet appropriate for a teen . the short hair of this doll and tight clothing does not lend itself to childs play and is more suited to a serious doll collector or mcbride fan
toys	i purchased this toy for my 3yr old in december last year . he has not been able to use it since we have not been able to find any products ( discs , carrying case etc ) for the videonow . i have called the company several times . everything is always unavailable and i do check on a regular basis . my son has been watching black and white discs recently from his older brother on the machine so he will get some use out of it . it was a good idea but the company leaves a lot to be desired . if you make a product make sure that there are enough discs . it is simply a waste of money and time . i can not continue going on line and checking a couple of times every week . i hope this info factors in in your decision to purchase this toy
toys	the bed looks very nice.. [ ... ] when you have a toddler who is starting to climb out of their crib..this probably wo n't make it in the reviews but i 'm writing it anyway
toys	i bought this for my 3 year old daughter . she loved it in the store and i thought it was cute . i also agree with the other reviewers that there should be instructions for the stickers , but you do n't need to be a genious to figure out where they go . i chose to not sharoen the pencil because she is 3 and i did n't think it was necessary . for twenty dollars it is a good buy . i know my daughter loves it and is having a lot of fun with it
toys	previous reviews listed the lack of volume control as a negative point . in a panic i ran to check the three i have purchased for christmas gifts 2002 . all three have volume controls now ! do n't let reviews on a previous model keep you from purchasing these products . friends have these and my girls begged for their own . as a home-schooling mom i prefer to buy toys that are both fun and educational - leap frog is my best source
toys	got this for xmas present for 2 year old . he loved it , but sounds and steam quickly stopped working with zero abuse . incredibly cheap for a toy costing 40 bucks . this is just how to ruin a fan of the show . the folks who design such badly designed stuff should be ashamed of themselves . my son is important and deserves toys that can last more than two days
toys	i am a seamstress who knows how to sew , and how to thread both top and bobbin threads . my daughter received this machine for christmas . we threaded it according to directions . it sews about 10 stitches then jams . i observe that the bobbin design is such that the bobbin wobbles within the casing , and leads to a jam every time . do n't disappoint a child by purchasing this
toys	this is a well engineered product ; i can not call it a toy because it is much much more than that . after building just one of the sample setups i was able to put down the manual and start creatively designing and building my own . my daughter ( 3.5 years old ) loves it . she really likes placing a marble on the run when i tell her its time to `` test it '' , and i let her identify the error . the only marbles that have fallen off the track are due to construction errors by myself . after 1 day ( and several of our own setups ) we already find ourselves wanting more pieces . i suggest buying the largest set from the get go if you have an engineering type mind or just enjoy puzzles . nice feature to note : the coloring of the blocks is logical ; each color has its own unique function ( s ) .
toys	i do n't know if we got some old box left over , or what . magnets are so weak , that kids ca n't make anything vertical . they just collapse , and slide . if i knew of course i would n't have purchased . i got rid of the box , so i could n't even return it . over priced big time ! !
toys	i have to agree with everyone before me . flimsy , hard to put together , does n't stay together , impossible to close . my four old , who is obsessed with batman , lost interest after 5 minutes and i really ca n't blame him . spend your $ 50 on something else ! ! ! not a good purchase ! ! ! ! !
toys	if i would have been able to try this out before buying it i would have never bought it . the surface is way to hard for a baby to be laying on it . the it is not too sensitive to movement so when baby kicks or moves it doesnt always turn itself on . i would have much rather bought a playmat instead .
toys	bought this for my 2 1/2 year old for christmas and he loves it . all you have to do is press a button on the back and it moves it 's head and roars . very easy for the young kids to do and my little guy loves it
toys	we did not buy the refill but purchased the original set with sandbox . it works wonderfully and my kids have played with it for hours . clean up is easy . another family i know just used theirs for the 1st time and they also had a wonderful experience .
toys	i bought this set for my son who loves to draw and paint . he absolutely loved this set . the colors are wonderful and the different types of pens , paints and crayons make drawing alot more fun for him . the case is sturdy and great so he does n't lose anything . the price ca n't be better for everything you get .
toys	this doll is cute and fun to play with . my daughter loves it . i like these dolls better then bratz . they need to make more dolls that are dressed the way kids are . i think that lil does . im happy and my daughter has a toy i think will be around for a long time .
toys	have this unit in out house , we have the one with one base unit and two mobile units . a few things to note . the ones we had do not offer rechargeable batteries . it uses alkaline only , or if you have your own charger you could use rechargeable but would be nicer if it recharged while plugged in . we live in nyc , queens to be exact . we hear taxi cab radio chatter over this at times , especially at night . also if unit is close to base unit static is not too bad but still annoying in bedroom , but if you have it one floor away , forget it . unless child is screaming all you hear is static . on both units . only has two channels a b which are set manually at both base and hand held units . so if you have a bad signal in middle of night , you have to go into child 's room and change channel . just do n't wake the baby ! ouch ! also missing a pager and a `` walkie talkie '' feature . they would be very nice . not a deal breaker if they do n't have it but it can be handy especially if your two floors up with baby with a full diaper and spouse is in basement and you need more diapers from garage . i am about to have a second child , and i am replacing this unit with a better one , i am looking at one of the new digital units that have the noise/static reduction . consumer reports gave some of them their top marks . they are however way more pricey than these , some are near $ 200 and only one receiver . but they all have charging bases and most importantly they are static free with auto channel switching
toys	i got this as a gift for my neece , she loves it , her parents love it too . she is now three years old , she got it last yr. for christmas , ... i was over to see her yesterday , and it still is like new . the velcro is very strong.. and it 's a very safe toy.. her baby brother , now is playing with it too , he is one yr . i recommend to all ! great buy .
toys	i am very unhappy with this product . the handle is hard to turn , and it takes too long for the clown to pop up . when the clown does pop up it smells like a forst fire inside of the toy . over all i would not recomend it
toys	it 's amazing how much a child learns by having access . we are an american family living in germany and felt my 5 year old would have a greater understanding of where we live and where our extended family lives
toys	my baby is only a year old and has a blast playing in his tent and tunnel .
toys	i was disappointed with the quality of this item . little tike is a name i have learned to trust and this was a bummer . the front broke because of it 's poor design and flimsy plastic parts . so now it is just a broken dump truck . also you have to push the button for the sounds to work . it is not motion sensitive .
toys	we bought this for our snowboarding 11-year-old son . being used to playstation and gamecube , he was n't impressed with the graphics and control of the characters is very clunky . it 's a cool concept -- but it needs more time in development
toys	we like the lunchbox because of the cute designs , but were a little disappointed in it 's durability . the first time i dropped it on the ground , it scratched off parts of the design . so , mom did some creative thinking and did some touch up paint and sealed the design with `` self laminating sheets '' . that did the trick . we also wished the thermos and lunchbox were insulated . other than that , it 's o.k
toys	the 3-d solar system is great . i rated it 5 stars because i knew there was no sun , so this product was exactly what i expected . easy to hang up , glows well , my 6 year old son is very happy with it ! a sun would be nice , but still well worth the money
toys	not only did this phone not work , but the screen was really quite tiring on my eyes . the only ringtone that it had was a sound like beads being shaken up . the flashing light was distracting , and its features were extraordinarily limited ! the camera option did n't work at all , and where the heck was the texting ? ? ? my parents bought this phone for me for my birthday , and it really made me mad ! ! i can see that this might be a good starter phone , but you can only get 0 calls froim it , and really limited reception in the mountains . switch to a razr as soon as possible
toys	very pleased with this purchase ... my 2 yr. old daughter loves playing with her new kitchen ! the kitchen came fully assembled and all plastic parts are very sturdy . the telephone is fun - and is actually my daughter 's favorite part of the whole kitchen ! i know of 4 other friends who have this same kitchen - and all are pleased with their purchase
toys	it 's a pretty good toy but most people get sick of them as they get frustrated and ca n't do every side the same colour on each side . if you 're ready for frustration then this cube is for you . if you are buyin it then have fun
toys	my son got this for his 4th birthday . moon sand is a terrible toy -- ugly and messy . he seemed to enjoy playing with it ( but no more than play doe ) , but the clean up is horrible . the sand stuck to the treads of his shoes and was tracked throughout the house .
toys	my 21 month old toddler loved the star crayon , and so did i initially . however , during its first use the red crayon fell out of the plastic holder . the problem is the shape of the crayon is like a round piece of candy . my son picked it up and was about to put it in his mouth when i saw what had happened . personally , i would not use the product given the choking hazard that it presented . otherwise , i would use it with care and watch your child carefully as they play with the product .
toys	this is not really a practical toy . my son gets discouraged , because you have to press on the keys really hard and in order to follow the music you have to be rough . it 's like playing musical chairs with 5 bullies and a moving floor
toys	i got this toy for my one of my triplet sons for his 5th birthday , and i am appalled that i paid $ 50 for such a poorly made product . they say it `` transforms '' into the batmobile - that is a joke ! you have to take most of it apart to get it to fold back up , so why bother with that `` feature '' in the first place ? the whole thing is made terribly . it barely stands upright , and the little plastic chains that suspend the one set of platforms keep coming off the little plastic hooks . none of my boys play with it , and now i am stuck with it because i do n't have the box anymore to return it . bottom line : this was a complete waste of money
toys	my son absolutely adores all his thomas the tank engine stuff . what can i say ? edward the blue engine is a fine addition to any child 's collection
toys	i do n't usually write reviews but had to voice my opinion on this toy . i agree with the other review that the dolphins do not stay attached to the chariot and this frustrates my 4-year-old daughter ! also our dolphins fall off and the one that is supposed to flip around gets stuck and does not flip half the time . all that being said , she loves it
toys	yum ... play food ! this is a great set . i will buy it as soon as i find it . this is a great set ! lots of cans ( good for storage ) , ice cream , boxed treats , cookies , ( yummy ) , and of course , much more . and who could resist the spaghetti with meatballs ? and is that chocolate chips on the ice cream ? oh my gosh , it 's better than i thought . you might think that to have a good time , your child needs 40 dollar melissa and doug wooden play food with real cutting noises and a fisher price 100 dollar kitchen for imaginative play . bullpies , i say . i have tons of dollar-store food . i have ultra-realistic foam food from a kitchen set i got . i prefer the dollar store food . dollar store food is better because it has more in one package , looks real , is cheap , pretty durable , and looks nice . i have a really silly play food set that came with a stovetop ( small , but the knobs turn ! ) , a pink and purple propane tank , a can of `` barracuda '' ( seriously ) , and a can of `` barracuda hash '' which included barracuda , ham and eggs , chicken , turkey , potpie , and more eggs . but the logo has spam and a hotdog , and the front of it has beans , turkey , fish , sausage , and lots of weird meat . but it says `` eatable , 100 % dainty , present ! , daintiness , dainty '' . just wanted to let you know . so , bottom line is , dollar store play food is much better than you think it is . it comes with lots of things that the expensive companies would never have dreamed of
toys	legos , duplos , ello.. they do n't hold a candle to the kid knex in the series . unbelieveable how much our 6 year old daughter plays with these and our 3 yo son too . these have a good feel for kids too . bright . easy to use . we have all in set now . bring on some more
toys	this bowl is extremely cute but it does not suction to the high chair . i can get it to suction to the counter and my glass table but not on my baby 's highchair , so it really does n't serve the purpose it is suppose to
toys	i purchased this train case for my son last christmas , ( age 6 ) . it is very sturdy , with handle . i like that all the trains can be put into one place and carried away simply/easily . those moms like myself , when your child has finished playing , there is now a place for them to put their trains in . the 'metal ' case is a great added bonus , the trains have the magnetic ends and they easily go into case . next play time , the trains are all in one spot . thomas , come up with a place like this for the track - i need it
toys	this is perfect for any kurt cobain/nirvana fan . it looks great , definitely reminiscent of the smells like teen spirit music video . i bought it as a gift but almost kept it for myself ! if you are thinking of getting it , i would recommend you do so . you wo n't be disappointed
toys	my 10 year old received the massively mini media player for christmas and she and i both are very disappointed in it . there is simply not enough memory and this product does not seem to be compatible with our napster files ( at least not readily . perhaps i could burn them to cd then rip them back to my computer and then transfer them to the mini media player but i have not tried that yet . ) folks , 128mb is a joke even for a young child . there are much better players out there in the same price range . i own the sansa e250 which is a solid little mp3 player and i am seriously considering buying the same model for her as well
toys	the retro-slinky dog , however cute , just does n't work . we have tried it on the hardwood floor , the carpet , the title . we have tried tying a string arounds it 's neck , adding a string to it 's short stubby string , using the short stubby string to pull it but nothing works . our kids 2 6 just drag it around laying on it 's side -- it 's just not fun -- the head is too heavy and it does n't move well at all . i would not buy it . the fisher price doggy we got is very cute and it stays upright , it walks with you and the pull-string is a good length -- plus it 's cute too ! !
toys	this game was given to our 3 year old as a gift and he loves it . his little sister , who is two , also loves this game . this game really helps to develop a childs ability to concentrate on visual cues . it is basically a matching game combined with a puzzle concept . there are no complex rules to learn , so within minutes of opening the box any child can begin to play and enjoy this game . as each match is made the child receives immediate reward and motivation to find a new match . best of all is that this is a simple game with no buzzers or bells and is best played with the tv turned off
toys	i love this thing ! great product , great deal , great times to look forward to with my grandson - he simply goes nuts over it ! thanks
toys	this toy is not what i had expected . it is n't very durable at all and it 's hard to put together ! i do n't highly recommend it
toys	we purchased all of the figures for my daughter for christmas . within 2 weeks of her receiving this one , the pin fell out of her leg and her leg fell off . we replaced it with a new one and the pin on the leg of that one fell off within a month . the head does not stay on invisible violet , syndrome broke in half , violet 's pin fell out of her arm , and mr . incredible lost the pin in his leg . my daughter does not play rough with her toys . just normal play and they fell apart . also , helen is supposed to be elasta girl . why did n't they make her stretch ? did n't make sense to me
toys	i ca n't wait until i get the movie barbie fairytopia mermaida when it comes out its going to be a great movie for kids and even for the whole family i do n't know if i will get the dolls i think the movie will be funer to watch than just play with the doll
toys	i was very happy to discover that i could purchase an asian cabbage patch girl doll ... it was for a little korean girl ... .the doll pictured on the website looked like the little girl that it was purchased for ( the hair ) . well , i was excited to find one and i wanted to make sure that i would receive it in time to wrap it and mail it to texas in time for christmas . i ordered in on the 27th and received it on dec. 1st ( i paid for faster shipping ) . when i opened the box it was an asian doll but not the one with the ponytails ... this doll had short hair . i called amazon immediately and although they expressed being sorry they said that they could not guarantee that it would n't happen again . i have used amazon before with no problems but i am extremely unhappy with the bait and switch . i should have read the other reviews . i will never let that happen again . beware ... do not order things of this nature from this website . you will be disappointed
toys	this is a quality product . good detail . holds air well , ready to blow up and hang from attached loop . an excellent buy
toys	we bought this for our 10 month old son for christmas . he really enjoys it , but the steering stripped out within the first week so he can only go straight . we have to follow him around and turn it . other than that it 's been a good buy . he can play with it inside and out . he 's 16 months old now and will be getting a bigger , faster 12 volt 4-wheeler soon
toys	i would not recommend this product for anyone over 3 1/2 years ( unless small for their age ) . my 4 yr old son ( 36lbs ) got it for his birthday , and broke the steering wheel within 10 minutes . there is plenty of room for him on the seat and inside the car , but its been `` parked '' since broken . i wish we would have spent the money on something that would have lasted . the plastic seems cheaply made . the voice buttons and noises are loud and work well . stickers have already started to flake/peel off after 1 month . consider a bigwheel
toys	my nephew absolutely loved the games in this nemo cartridge ... i did do because they are educational and teach him various things that he probably would have no interest in ... at least he is broading his horizons in a way that he enjoys
toys	i purchased this expansion set , along with the thomas and friends water towr figure 8 set , for my 2 year old this past christmas . the expansion set was an afterthought , prompted in no small part by the manufacturer 's promotion running at the time ( 50 % off this set with the purchase of a figure 8 set ) . with the conclusion of many initial hours of intense playtesting ( an ongoing process , with no termination in sight ) , my son agrees that this is an essential choice for any but the most basic ( read : boring ) wooden railroad layout . this expansion pack comes with switch tracks , and allows little train engineers ( and their dads ) to reverse directions or explore different parts of the railway . in retrospect , i think that i would have been dissatisfied had i not purchased this set to complement the basic figure 8 layout , promotional price or not . as far as the quality , the learning curve wooden track is made from hardwood , and is more substantial than many other brands of compatible track ( i.e . maxim , first learning , etc. ) . this is a consideration when your child insists on taking the track apart by him/herself to put away . we have already broken a couple of pieces of generic track this way , since the male end of the connectors is a bit weaker than the rest of the track . overall , we are quite satisfied with this set , and look forward to many more hours of enjoyment
toys	i bought this for a present for my 2 yr old daughter and she likes it and can turn the handle
toys	my grandparents bought me this for christmas and i really love it ! the doll is absolutely breathtaking , and she has honey blond hair with golden highlights . her eyes are a deep blue green color , and she is very pretty overall . the closet she comes with is very cute , and i can put barbie shirts and skirts on the little hangers ! there is a lot of room for shoes and purses and hair accessories , i love this toy
toys	it is really expensive for what it is . i have to say my children love it , esspecially since we can put it in the middle of the table and everyone can take what they need from it . i love that when we are done you can put everything back and stick it on a shelf . however , for the supplies you get it is expensive . the tote itself is nice but not worth more than $ 5 , add the supplies to it , maybe i could see spending $ 10 . however , if you catch it on sale i would pick up a few , they make great gifts
toys	not sure what happened , but i received my daughter 's gift in the mail today . there were no penguins in the box , and but the packaging looked original with no tampering . beware , if you 're ordering from imaginarium ! what a disappointment this was for us
toys	i had purchased two of these smack and yack cars for my grandson . while wrapping them the night before i planned to give the gift , i discovered that they did not make noise as advertised . if i had looked at them earlier , i would have returned them for a refund . it 's no fun to have grandchildren that are disappointed
toys	my son got this for christma when he was 10 months old . from day one he loves to push it around the house . he 's 13 months old now and he can get on to ride it . his friends love it also .
toys	i 'm sure this would be a fun toy , but for us it did n't last long enough to find out . we had this in our pool for 5 minutes and one of the guns stopped working . the boys were very disappointed ! i will be taking this back to the store tonight and try to exchange it with a new one that hopefully works
toys	while my son enjoyed the illustrations anf fun content of the books in this set , i felt it was disappointing as a learning tool for beginning readers because it moves much too quickly . the first book is just letters and letter sounds . very introductory . the second book introduces three letter words right off with no transition at all like 2 letter blends . that was ok to me since it was phonetic 3 letter words , but by page 2 we were already `` leaping '' to 4 and 5 letter words and by page 3 they were already introducing a sight word - `` does '' and a double consonant word - `` can not '' . i thought the pace was frustrating for my son . i was hoping/expecting a book devoted to just blends and/or 3 letter words . instead this program is organized by vowels with the letter a being introduced first . i do n't see that as a problem , but i was expecting more phonetic 3 letter words to start and introducing harder 4 and 5 letter words by maybe book 3 and sight words coming later , like maybe book 4 . unfortunately , you ca n't see exactly what your getting until you open the box . nonetheless , the audio is entertaining for children with music and humor thrown in and the reward stickers , poster , and ribbon are a fun way to recognize your child 's achievement . the practice game is basically just like the word whammer fridge phonics product but with cards instead of magnets
toys	my 3 yo twin boys love this , but one station is a little difficult to maneuver , it is very sensitive , even for my 6 yo boy . all in all , i would recommend this for all those little train lovers !
toys	even though i purchased this watch for my grandson for christmas from another store , it was not worth the money . it does nothing and my grandson abandoned it soon after opening it . i picked up few pieces from under the sofa last night . i did see on one toy store 's website that there is a deluxe model that is probably better . i wish i had known that before i spend $ 10 on this piece of junk .
toys	this product is a box o ' junk . my son got this for christmas this year and it is not even worth whatever the person paid for it . the hat fell apart within three days ( and he hardly played with it - just wore it on his head a few times ) - the metal rim around the hat came undone and now there is a sharp metal point sticking out through the cloth on the hat , which is obviously dangerous . i contacted the company and they have not responded .
toys	my son got this game as a gift . i brought it into my junior high classroom to use on a game day . the kids love this game and request it over and over . many other teachers have asked to borrow it for their classes . it is a great vocabulary builder . i also made my own cards with letters of the alphabet on them . i use these when we are studying parts of speech -- they have to come up with a noun ( adjective , verb , etc ) that begins with that letter . this is a great game and a good way to make a rather dull subject more interesting
toys	when the toa and all the first bionicles came out , it was very simple and straigthforward . bad guys were different from the toa and everyone knew they were bad . now , with the pirahka , we have villians claiming to be toa ! and the matoran believe them ! one of the things i really love about zaktan is his weapon . it looks really cool and can change . also , the little ball launcher ( i forget what it 's called ) is a lot of fun ( i shot my brother with it x3 ) and the glowing eyes are just plain awesome ! though the rubber part is sligthy annoying , it does n't really get in the way
toys	my 3 year old just loves it.. this truck has been great and very durable.. i have a 9 year old boy and he and his friends have just as much fun as my little one.. we love the fact that we are the only one in the neighborhood that has the black escalade.. we have certainly got our moneys worth .
toys	it is fun to play with and kind of educational because you have to strap the babies in their car seats
baby	it 's flimsy ... breaks at the slightest touch ... it 's a pain to open and close ! my 15 month old figured out that all you have to do is shake the gate a little and it opens ... i found this out when i was putting groceries away ... i went to look for her and she was on the 2nd stair from the top ! i ca n't say enough bad things about this gate . it 's worthless . if i could rate it minus stars i would
baby	my almost- 3 yr old daughter needed a new umbrella stroller ( she 's tall , but still gets tired sometimes , especially if i take her shopping ) . i researched the options and picked the maclaren volo . my first stroller before it was chicco capri , and it always bumped against my legs , which was annoying and uncomfortable . when the canopy broke , i got rid of it and decided on buying a new one for plane travel and local outings . the volo seemed great - light , handsome , convenient , and highly rated by parents . i ordered the stroller and , upon unpacking it , was quite pleased with its appearance . i read the instructions and learned to use it . the stroller seemed sturdy , well-made , and easy to maneuver , not to mention chic . the washable seat was a good idea , i thought . i liked how large it was ( perfect for an older child ) , and how easily it moved . when i took the new volo around the block , i noticed that one of the double back wheels was not aligned properly ( one was higher than the other and did not rotate , which caused the stroller to make a scraping sound ) . then the other set stopped rotating when one ( ! ) pine needle got stuck in it ! i had to carefully remove it with my hands in the middle of the street . needless to say , that 's not the quality i expected , since every parent i know raved about maclaren . the canopy kept sliding off the rails , as well - something you would not want at the airport , with your toddler and luggage and the car seat in tow . when i got home , i looked at the wheels closely and tried to adjust them , but to no avail . they were flimsy ( i could dent them with my finger if i wanted to ! ) , way too small and just poorly designed . i immediately packed up the stroller and returned it to amazon . i was very disappointed . one would think that for such a high price , the wheels would be usable - after all , they are the most important feature of any stroller . i will stay with chicco and order a c6 . at least i know that the wheels are great , and you ca n't beat the price
baby	i have a volvo 960 sedan and wanted to use the seat saver in the middle seat and it did not work . the bottom section was too large for the space between the seat belt/buckle and did not allow the carseat base to be properly placed . my friend has one of those nylon seat protectors and it is much better
baby	my wife purchased this toy box at our local toys r us . it went together fine , but ours must have been factory defective because the entire thing smelled like wet paint . in fact , we had to return the unit because the fumes were making our daughters cry whenever they went into their room . little tykes makes this unit , but they were of no help when i called customer satisfaction . they told me just to return it and that they 've never heard of this problem .
baby	i bought this carseat ( different color ) because i liked the features . however , everytime i put my now 5 week old in the seat his head plops forward . i have tried everything , from putting a diaper or towel around his head because the headrest sucks , to trying to push the base down so it does n't sit up so high . do you know how nerve wrecking it is to be driving just to look back and see you newborn 's head ploped forward so bad that he is choking . not good graco , this carseat could not have been tested before . i had an evenflo with my previous child and did not have this problem . i am truly disappointed . can anyone could tell me how to make this problem go away , i am all ears . i know the seat is right because the balance window is all blue . i have talked to other mothers and they have the same problem . help ! ! !
baby	used an infantino front carrier for several hours a day until my back started to hurt . purchased the ultimate baby wrap based on the reviews here . i liked the idea of even weight distribution and being able to put baby in different positions . while using the wrap is n't intuitive ( ie watch the dvd ) it 's easy to learn . my back problems are gone and baby is more snug in the wrap ( tummy to tummy ) than in traditional front carriers . i wanted to use the sling position but baby is too big length and width wise . only gripe is that there is no neck support in the tummy to tummy position so i have to hold baby 's head while i rock her to sleep . would recommend this product , great price too
baby	i 'm not certain why there are so many glowing reviews for this product . my wife registered for this item because the 4 stage tub looked good in theory . unfortunately , because of the collapsible design this `` bath '' tub does not hold water , it just runs out of the seam where the two sides come together . there is a foam gasket around the seam that is intended to hold the water in , but it is useless . the sling is useful for bathing an infant , and the removable ring does it 's job of keeping an infant upright while learning to sit . unfortunately , by the time our infant was ready to sit we had already replaced this piece of junk . i guess they call it safety 1st as your kid ca n't drown in a dry bath tub
baby	i did n't like these for a few reasons . they take up too much room in my freezer . they take too long to thaw . i do n't care for the avent isis pump . i have been using the gerber freezer bags instead and i can freeze my milk flat and it thaws much quicker .
baby	my little girl loves this play space ! the colors and over head bar keep her amused for long enough that i can get dinner on or help with home work . the only thing that might make it better would be if the music in the push button play mat lasted longer than 2 minutes .
baby	i think the floppy seat is a great idea -- aside from the cleanliness factor , my son would be too small to just sit in the regular cart seat area ; this way , i can pad him in and he 's secure . however , i find it very difficult to manage . i see that the previous reviewer said that she puts it in the cart with one hand -- i say kudos to her because i find it extraordinarily difficult to hold my almost-20 lb . baby in one hand and put the floppy seat in the cart with the other ! the elastic keeps it on when it 's on , but it also makes it so that you have to physically stretch it over the sides of the cart ... i challenge you to do it with one hand ! also , i think that the act of strapping the baby in can be dangerous . i am trying to hold him in the seat with one hand and feed the strap through the tiny hole in the back of the floppy seat with the other ... you have to really be aware of what your baby is doing because at that point s/he is not strapped in and can easily fall out . all of that being said , once baby is properly `` installed '' , it does make for a convenient trip down the grocery aisles
baby	i was initially very happy with this product . we purchased it to transition our 2-year-old to a double bed . however , the plastic hinge bracket broke after several months of use . since i liked the product , i thought maybe i did n't have it adjusted correctly and bought a second one . it , too , broke ; so i 'm now looking for a sturdier alternative
baby	after 5 boys my first daughter just had to have a pink highchair for her princess 1st birthday party so i retired the boys trusty blue graco ( still in great shape after 4 years ) into the basment and ordered this pink one . after what we paid for it ~ i do n't know how to tell my husband i want the blue one back ! ( maybe i can fnd a pink cover ? ! ) my daughter is 12 months old 20 pounds and can not reach the tray without dropping food into her lap . there is a 3inch gap between her the tray so half her food she tries to feed herself drops into her lap . the thick padded seat is adorable comfy for her but it has such deep crevices you really have to dig deep to get every crumb cleaned up . the base is very large her food falls down onto it after every meal so i am not only cleaning the floor but the base as well . the buckles are awkward impossible to do with one hand . if you have a petite baby ~ this is not the highchair for you
baby	this bed was hard to put together but it was well worth the trouble . it is a great buy for the price . you ca n't go wrong if you have a little time and patience to put it together
baby	the monitor is ok , but sometimes is staticky and other times just needs a new `` channel '' and the problem with that is that the button that changes the channel is in the baby 's room not on the parent unit ! ! ! also , we like to have a second child unit elsewhere in our house and if both are on at the same time it seems to cause additional static , broken signal ( only to be reset by changing the channel ) and no signal . overall , i am very disappointed - it got tremendous reviews and i expected a better product than the first years model i had previouly ... and i am goig back to my old one
baby	absolutely love this product ! ! wish i had had one for my other 3 children . we live in cold and windy north dakota and this is just so easy to use . there have been times my little one has gotten too hot when i over bundle him in it . i recommend this to any one expecting a little one in the winter months .
baby	this is so much better than those crappy plastic boosters i ca n't believe we did n't buy it sooner . it 's easy to clean and does n't slide off the chair . our son fits in it perfectly and now feels like a big boy . it even has a little carrying bag to take on trips . great vendor with quick delivery too
baby	we have switched bottles with my daughter more times than i would like to admit . she 's had gas and discomfort with all of them . i decided to try avent bottles ... i bought twelve of them and at first they seemed to relieve some of the gas . but they leak horribly . sometimes it 's a few drops . but most times it 's like a continuous stream of formula . a couple of times i was n't paying close enough attention to the bottle while feeding and formula ended up soaking my daughter 's bib , her sleep sack , her onesie , and my shirt . the entire bottle emptied all over us before i knew it ... the leak was that fast ! i tried every suggestion given to me : mixing the formula in a seperate container , mixing it in the bottles , and using sealing disks to mix in the bottle ; heating before adding to the bottles , heating in the bottles ; wetting the nipples , not wetting the nipples ; making sure the bottle rim was properly inserted into the nipple ring , etc . i wrote a letter to avent and called twice about this issue . each time , the customer service rep spoke down to me and said i must not have read and followed the directions ( which i had ) . do n't waste your money on these expensive , poorly designed bottles ! ! ! these are the worst on the market in my experience .
baby	we got this for our cruise and it worked great . it was very easy to carry and load onto the train , bus , and car when it was needed . the material is very think and easy to wipe off if it gets dirty
baby	in our pursuit for ultimate baby items , the infant carseat topped our list . what 's more important than the safety of your first child , especially in so unpredicatable a situation as driving ? our search led us to this graco carseat , and we added it to our wish list and recieved it as a christmas gift , just before our daughter 's birth in january . the seat is fairly attractive , but its good points stop there . it 's a bear to install . not because it 's complicated , but rather because you need an extraordinarily strong man ( or a woman , unlike myself certainly ) to install the base . we ended up taking it to an inspector who spent about 5 minutes tugging on the belts with all his might , and then huffed and puffed and told us `` that should be in there real good , now . '' we examined it , and asked why the seat was still able to flip up toward the back of the car , and he replied , `` oh they all do that , that 's normal . '' unsure , but with the safety rating to back it , we continued to use it . throughout her first 7 months it was a cumbersome piece of equipment . lots of bumping and banging it about to get it into the car with the baby already in the seat ( we have 3 4-door sedans , a 1992 subaru legacy , an 80-something oldsmobile , and my mom 's 2006 saturn ion . with the seat already in the car , it 's a struggle to get the baby in without bumping her head or catching her legs on the sides at least once - for me . my husband simply ca n't put her in with the carseat already in the car . not to mention that , the seat - while installed in the car - has never felt especially stable , with the exception of my mom 's ion , which has the latch system . of course , the drawback of the ion is that my 6'1 '' husband can barely fit into the front seat because the carseat is so large and cumbersome that he can not move his seat back and so he is sort of smashed into the dashboard . then , in the past week the seat has begun to fall over while we 're driving . literally , go around a curve , look back , and her seat 's at a 45 degree angle from the backseat of the car . my daughter is 8.5 months old still falls a bit below the weight and height limits for the seat . we 've checked the belts that secure the seat , pulled with all our might , and the seat continues to malfuction . this is a safety issue if i 've ever seen one . with enough force , she could end up directly on her side , say the force of a side impact in an accident . upon closer inspection , i should n't be altogether shocked . the base of the seat is proportionately much smaller than the top where baby sits . sort of like a wine glass , i suppose - so it 's top heavy , and likely the heavier the load on top , the greater the likelihood it will topple at the slightest provocation . needless to say , we 'll begin shopping for a new seat immediately . as for the snugride , i would recommend parents think twice before purchasing it . i 'd certainly never consider it for an older vehicle without the latch system , and i 'd still take it for a trial run in a newer one that does have the latch system . in hindsight i wish i had shopped around a bit more .
baby	i never got to use this sheet . i pre-washed it and put it to dry on low heat as i 've done with all the baby clothes . i later saw the label said to air dry , which seems ridiculous for something that 'll be washed so often . anyway , it shrunk and does n't fit over the co-sleeper mattress . if you have time/space to air dry it , it 's probably a fine product .
baby	i bought this product because it has two most important things i am looking for : portable and the splash guard . my son feels very comfortable with it that he has been using this since last august when we got it . the parts are all plastic for easy cleaning . the cushion part of the seat and the the splash guard are all one piece , unlike some other potty seat where the splash guard is an attachment . so that 's very easy to clean . the entire potty can be disembled to be cleaned and sanitized from inside out , no hard to reach spots . the seat is soft and contoured with oval opening which is best , unlike a lot of potty i found with a circular small opening . the seat can be put on adult toilet seat which i started training my son after several use to avoid cleaning the bowl . the only thing i wish is that this product comes in just the seat without the bowl , then that would be even better !
baby	we bought this stroller for my daughters : 4.5 years/38 pounds/42 inches and 2 years/26 pounds . we were in the market for a new stroller because one of the wheels on our old double stroller had broken off twice and was about to break off again . i was looking for a stroller that would n't make my older daughter feel like `` a baby , '' but gave her the option of sitting during long trips to the mall , zoo , park , etc . this stroller was the answer ! the front seat is perfect for our little one . the tray swings open ( and comes completely off , if needed ) to get her in and out easily . i was able to unhook some of the belts and stuff them behind the cushion of her seat because i did n't think a 5-point harness was necessary . the tray is large and sturdy , as is the foot rest . my older daughter is technically taller than the guidelines , but we have absolutely no problem because of it . she walks with us and then easily climbs onto her seat when she wants to take a break . the parent tray is great and something i really missed on our last double stroller . we can store keys , snacks , cellphone , etc. , plus two cups/bottles . the basket underneath is a good size and very easy to access . the side of the basket is elastic and pulls down nicely and even unsnaps if need be . the stroller folds and unfolds extremely easily . it takes very little room to store . the steering is fantastic and it requires very little effort to push . the stroller also comes with a contraption to fit an infant carrier for families with a newborn/infant . the price is fantastic too . you ca n't beat $ 120 for a double stroller like this ! i wish we had bought this a year ago
baby	easiest purchase . just love the crib and the price was unbelievable including shipping cost
baby	hi this is the 5th gate we have had on the top of our stairs . some were difficult to open when you are also holding a child . some were so noisy you could never slip down stairs while baby was sleeping and others simply felt like a strong sneeze would topple them over . this one is great i love the fact that the lock is difficult enough that a 4 year has trouble but not difficult enough that grandma has trouble !
baby	i thought this cover was horrible . it does n't cover enough area of the cart . it 's difficult to put on because of all the ties . i could n't even get the harness to fit right . try one of the other seat covers instead that have elastic , you can put them on the cart with one hand , and it completely covers the cart , even the big ones at costco
baby	i bought these bottles because my daughter was having trouble with the flow of other bottles.they were to fast for her .like the other reviews this was also the only paci she would take that did n't gag her . great for little babies that ca n't control their flow control
baby	every single time , the reading is way low - around 94.9 or something like that . it is extremely unreliable . do n't waste your money
baby	i received this seat for a gift and was told how wonderful it is . i have a large baby . he was almost 17 lbs at four months old . so his thighs and bottom barely fit in it after three to four months of age . he also was able to get out of it bu straightening his back and legs . he did n't seem very happy in it . it may work better if you have a smaller baby , but the chubbier ones will never fit for long
baby	i bought this product after reading the many positive reviews below , and i was thoroughly satisfied . my only complaint was actually with my luggage , as the handle on my bag was a little short so i had to stoop a little while i was pushing/pulling it . everyone who saw it thought it was the neatest invention ever , especially other moms traveling with kids . the strap is so simple it 's genious - just strap on the carseat and go ! it was a bit of a hassle restrapping at security , but everything is a hassle at security . just make sure you have a few extra minutes to get everything back together and it 's fine . this is a great product that made what could have been a very difficult trip a breeze . bravo !
baby	we loved this toy when my daughter received it for christmas . she loved to lay in her crib and look at it and recently even learned to turn it on by herself ! this morning i looked at the toy and noticed that the water compartment was almost empty ! the water drained out of the compartment it belongs in and back in to the part which contains the musical mechanisms and the battery connections ! it 's not exactly fixable , so we will move on to another crib toy
baby	we registered for this product since it includes so many items necessary for a baby . upon receiving it as a shower gift , i knew this was going to be great . i love the convenient pouch that all the tools and accessories come in . it 's small enough to carry around in a diaper bag . this is a must have for every new parent
baby	worst product ever ! safety 1st should recall this item if they have any sense at all . i 'd like to smack the so called engineer that designed this infant tub . my 10 month old son pinched his little privates so bad it gave him a blood blister . yeah , ouch ! ! ! the stinkin bar that goes between the legs slides in and out of place when the baby moves -- snap ! it pinches their private part . everything was just fine and then suddenly my son looked at me with such panic and then screamed and cried . i realize what had happened and quickly moved the bar . ouch ! it still makes me grit my teeth when i think about it . horrible product especially for baby boys .
baby	great , safe and nice looking bumper ! i would recommend it without hesitation
baby	our second one ( for a second child ) . we use one with a back ; one without . easy-to-use , comfortable , solid . a good choice for a booster seat at a good price
baby	i bought the smaller version `` diaper decor '' ( as opposed to the larger `` diaper decor plus '' ) about 18 months ago . although i believe the smaller version has been discontinued about a year ago , i have not yet had a problem finding the refill liners at my local babies r us or on-line here at amazon . i highly recommend the diaper decor . i do not have any experience with the diaper genie , so i can not compare . i have not had any odor problems with the diaper decor . it is very easy to change the liners and there is no mess . my foot-operated lid opener also broke like some other reviewers , but this has not been a problem with me . i just open the lid manually and leave it open while i am changing the diaper . i would recommend the diaper decor in the plus size
baby	i bought this monitor so i can hear what goes on in my sons room who is upstairs . i have crystal clear reception and i also have another monitor in the house for another room and they never get interrupted . it is extremly sensitive , every breath is heard . awesome monitor , no problems yet so far ! ! !
baby	bought 2 different monitors ; this one has great features such as the motion sensor , auto and scan settings . the night vision is weak but daytime looks great . better reception than the other video monitor i bought but not having good night vision is a drawback . i really bought the video monitors for keeping an eye on my mother who has alzheimers but using the 2 cameras comes in handy for both baby and mom . none of these seem to be as quiet as just a regular baby monitor without video but it is very comforting to see and not just hear . it is the best one that i 've found on the market
baby	i love how soft and cuddly this changing pad cover is . i also appreciate how many colors it comes in . what i am disappointed with is the durability . i have 3 of these and have used them for just over a year . they are totally falling apart at the elastic . now , keep in mind that we use disposable `` chucks '' ( those blue hospital disposable under pads ) on top of this terry cloth changing pad . it makes it less messy ( especially early on ) and does n't require washing as much . i also washed them in cold water with baby dreft detergent , hung them to dry and rotated the 3 covers that we have . while it is a nice product while it lasts , i just expected them to be more durable .
baby	the `` sticky '' pads that are supposed to hold the organizer do n't even stick , so every morning i would wake up to find the organizer sitting in a pile on the floor next to the changing table ... and this was with absolutely no items in it . the organizer does n't come with any information , so i had no idea if there were alternate ways to hang the organizer or not . this is a great idea , but it is very poorly constructed .
baby	this was the worst monitor we have ever had , and we have had several with our kids . it says the range is 600 feet , but it does n't even reach 200 . our cordless phone reaches twice the distance . the light makes it very annoying at night . it beeps loudly for no reason and cuts in and out frequently !
baby	i bought this product thinking it was different than the standard square playmats . i like the scalloped edges , the pillow and the colorful pictures , but i am disappointed in the playmat overall . the pat mat leaks so bad that i ca n't use it . the playmat is cute , but it is n't functional , not to mention , way overpriced . the arches have netting which i think freaks my son out . he has never liked this playmat . i have a square one that he seems to enjoy more
baby	this was the worst sunshade ever ! ! ! do n't waste your money . it is so flimsy that it offers no sun protection at all . we used it on our double jogger stroller but it just flopped down into the faces of our babies . i do not recommend this product . i only gave it a one star because zero star was not an option
baby	we can not get the refill bags into our diaper dekor plus . are there different size bags depending on whether you got the regular or plus unit ? the lady in the store said no so we bought 3 boxes of extra refills . now we cant use any of them . what should we do
baby	i bought this chair because of the great reviews , i hesitated at spending so much , but figured that all the features would be worth it considering my son would be using it for a couple of years . pros : i like that i can roll it around to the table , or to the sink to clean up after meals . the height adjustment is easy and convenient . the cons : folding it up did n't quite work as i thought it would . it did n't lock into the folding postition ... and did n't really save that much space . i would prop it against the wall , and hope that no one knocked it down . we finally stopped folding it up . the toys that connect to the tray were too dangerous for my son , as he would usually hit himself in the face with them when he was younger , by the time he was older , i did n't really need them . the battery operated toy has a funny smell to it whenever it 's been running for a while . he did like it ... but the buttons were too hard for him to press when he was younger . my son discovered at 7 months how to pull off the extra tray that can go into the dishwasher , so we do n't use that . he 's 13 months now , and last week discovered how to disconnect the tray itself and fling it off of the high chair . i washed the seat cover per the instructions , and half the time did not use the dryer , even though it said it could go into the dryer , and now the seat is bubling and cracking ... i have to place a cloth diaper in the seat to protect my son 's legs . if i had not spent $ 90.00 on the chair i would not be as disappointed ... but he 's only used it for 7 months .
baby	i bought this chair when my husband was working out of state as a consultant . i wanted a portable chair that my son could use in the hotel room to eat , watch tv , or drink his sippy cup . this chair was the perfect height , design , and was compact enough to fit in my suitcase without being too bulky . the problem is that it broke on the trip back from our first trip . the fault is in a joint . i bought a second chair and on the next trip kept it the box when i packed . but then my son stood on the chair and the same joint broke in two . that joint is really weak . too bad ! it 's such an adorable product
baby	this thermometer is not very accurate or consistant . whenever my son was sick and we used this it would give a normal temperature reading and i knew that it could n't be right . we would take our sons temperature 3 times in a row and never get the same reading twice . i even check my own temperature and it would come up with crazy readings like 95.1 ! we got rid of this one because fever-induced seizures run in my husbands family and we needed something more accurate . it has been my experience that nothing digital gives accurate readings and that the old-fashion oral and rectal thermometers work best
baby	we received this thermometer as a baby shower gift . for a few months it worked very well ... easy to use . after about 8 months it started acting strange , giving us inaccurate readings . the final straw was when the thermometer read 104.8 degrees sending us to the er at midnight only to find out our son 's temperature was n't even over 100 . the thermometer ended up in the trash can on our way out of the hospital .
baby	my wife and i bought this item for the usual reasons . we washed them and had no problems with fuzzballs or shredding . they 're just as soft and sturdy as they were before we washed them , if not a little softer . for the record , we washed them on the cold cycle with other baby clothes . they went through the drier for an hour at the lowest heat setting . anyway , i 'm just writing the review to offset the bad review . there was nothing wrong with the pads that we received , and they do what they 're supposed to do -- get between the warm baby and the cold changing table
baby	these bibs are the best . my son is a messy eater and loves to drink water and spit it out . when meal time is over his shirt is dry and all the water is in the handy pouch . must have for any new parent
baby	i am not one of those parents who have trouble getting my child in the bath , its getting him out that 's the problem . with the crayons he absolutely loves coloring on the walls in the tub the pallet was useless when he figured out that the tub was just one huge canvas . personally i think these are some of the best tub toys ! my suggestion is to just buy the crayons and forget the pallet . you can also use them in the pool and if you have a vinyl siding house and your children have sprinkler , it also makes a great place to color . be careful to wash everything off before it dries .
baby	we bought this for our son after experiencing some dirty or too large public toilets . my husband tried to use it for the first time yesterday and could not get it to fit the toilet at a restaurant and there was no way he could lift my son on to it without it slipping . i thought i would give it a try today when we were out for breakfast . typical toilet at einstein 's bagels . i had a hard time getting it to stay , lifted my son up and placed him on the seat . he let out a horrible scream and i lifted him up and threw the seat cover to the floor . he was bleeding . the primo folding potty seat cut him on his behind ! ! ! ! ! ! this product does not fit on toilets , the handles are blocking where the legs should go and instead of protecting him , it hurt him . we will just bring disinfecting wipes from now on . do not buy this ! ! !
baby	this diaper pail is certainly the worst i have used . it works ok for about a week and by the end of that first week i was ready to get a new diaper pail . it does not keep oders in much at all , and i do n't even put poopy diapers in it . after about a week the springs started constantly falling off of the thing inside that supposedly keeps the bag closed and the oder out so it does n't do any good . yes , a plus is the using regular bags , but so does the diaper champ and it also keeps oders in much better than this . i 'm definitely going back to the diaper champ ; i only bought this one because it was the only one at my store , now i know it was worth the wait for the diaper champ in the mail
baby	i think the mobile is very cute , but there is no way it will fit onto my crib properly . i tried attaching it in several differnt places . i am going to return it .
baby	i loved the idea that this car seat was . then after i bought it i have had problems with it . the handle realse has broken many times . then the gray handle part has came apart also . this is has not been safe at all . i went to return it and target would not return or exchange it for me . i think it was a waste of money
baby	my hsuband and and decided that i would nurse hailey her entire first year . i work at a school and was able to pump twice a day . i did n't like doing it in school though because there was n't space for it . so i would go in my car and do it . all i had a first was the battery pack . i would go through 10 batteries a week and half way through the week i would loose strength/suction . once i got the adapter i never had a problem again . we could go anywhere and i would always have access to power including when we drove from va to ga. my husband would drive and i would pump . it is great..
baby	i love this product in the fleece , but this is so light-weight . it defeats the purpose
baby	cons *wo n't stay in place i 've tried several times to position this correctly and it always slips out of place ( and baby is out of view ) i even sent away for the extra tether thinking that was the problem but no luck . *why a remote ? tell me what use the remote is when you have to press the on button which is located on the mirror and then if you do n't use the remote within five minutes to turn it on it automatically shuts off rendering the remote useless for the remainder of your car ride ? *the irritating song too short and plays over and over and over ( teeth gritting ) *learn what ? i 've also noticed in the teaching mode it does n't light up the right item with what the voice is saying . my poor confused baby will now think a blue car is a boat and a yellow house is a car ... pros *now i have $ 39.99 less to spend on snacks that will hinder me from losing those pregnancy pounds i gained..
baby	i hate , hate , hate this potty ! the shield will not stay on . my son sits on the potty and either the shield falls off into the potty or he grabs it and hands it to me saying `` here you go '' . it is also cumbersome to get the bowl out of the potty to empty . there is a lot of open space under the seat that gives bacteria a great chance to grow even with frequent cleaning . maybe this would work for a little girl but it is a no-go for a little boy
baby	i thought i would love this but just returned it . it hurt my neck so badly after only wearing it a short time ( 10 minutes ? ) maybe i 'm too small ( 5'2 '' ) or my baby ( 5 months and 18 pounds ) is too large . either way i still find the bjorn much more comfortable . i would like something where the baby is more sideways on my hip like this than either facing me or facing out and so confined as he is in the bjorn , but i could n't stand wearing ! very painful
baby	we bought this car seat ( and the snap 'n go ) based on good reviews ( not the ones listed here ) . it did not meet our expectations . i give it 2 stars just for the safety of it . otherwise , i have a hard time finding positive things to say . it is way too heavy . our baby was 7 lbs+ and from his early days , it was heavy to carry around . now that he is almost 20 pounds at 5+ months , it is nearly impossible to carry him for any length of time . the adjustable strap often gets stuck and we really have to tug to make it work . on most grocery carts it is too big to have it face towards you as you shop . when you do clip it on to the cart , the front end is suspended in the air . i just put it sideways which is a pain . also , the handle bar is built to be easier to carry ... i do n't agree . it is still awkward- i end up hooking it under my arm . lastly , to put the handle bar up and down is very difficult . you have to squeeze the taps on both sides and really push hard to get it to release . i 'm sorry that i do n't have any others to recommend . i had hoped to like this and am just suffering until he does n't need the support in the grocery cart -- -that is really the only reason i still use it
baby	this product is not a safe product and should not be used with your child . not only does it give additional padding that was not intended , nor tested with your safety seat , but it also voids the warranty of the safety seat . nhtsa ( national highway traffic safety administration ) is the government agency that sets standards for child safety seats and states that `` after-market products '' should not be used . it also does not meet fmvss213 standards as stated in the manufacturer 's description
baby	avent makes the best washable baby bottles around , so we felt that their sippy cups would be just as good . well we were wrong . of the five cups we had , all of them leaked and have since been thrown out . the cups are five different pieces vs other brands that use three pieces , which makes them harder to wash , harder to put together , and more pieces to lose . as far as sippy cups go , these are among the most expensive you can buy and worst that we used out five different brands . we have had great luck with greber 's and playtex 's . please avoid
baby	i have had two kids use my evenflo carseat . i hated it . it was like they never even tried it out to see how well its features worked . i finally got so sick of it when my 2nd child was 4 months old that i ordered a babytrend flexloc . at first i was seduced by the high safety ratings , but even after that consumer reports article was rescinded , i still liked a lot of the features . pros : -very comfy seat , good padding -the canopy is twice as long as my evenflo so it can cover baby almost completely - the canopy stays in place ; it does n't fall forward or backward behind the seat - the tightening mechanism under the baby 's feet is easy to reach and very easy to adjust to make the straps tighter or looser depending on what baby is wearing - the harness mechanism is very easy to adjust ( the shoulder strap height ) . my evenflo had to be rethreaded every few months and even my mechanically inclined husband said it was horrible . the flexloc is just a dial on the back that you turn -- it 's a breeze . - the seat can be transfered between cars without the base . it can be strapped directly to the car by using a seat belt on the car seat or by using the latch system if your car has it . - the triangular handle has a nice grip and is easy to hold in any position - this carseat is lighter than my evenflo - the cloth is very wipeable , not as absorbant of spills and stains as my evenflo cons : i found a few minor cons that definitely would not deter me from buying this carseat , and one that might ( depending on how i can resolve it once i contact babytrend ) . - the release button to take the seat off its base is at the toes under the seat . it 's a little harder to reach than the ones behind the head if the carseat is backward facing . - as others have said , the buttons to move the handle are a bit stiff , but not horribly so . i was prepared for them to be way worse . - the handle is thinner and does n't feel as sturdy as my evenflo when carrying baby around , but it has n't had any problems -this is the one big one that i have to check with babytrend on : twice when i have turned a corner sharply , the carseat has tipped to a 45 degree angle ! i have tightened down the seatbelt as much as i could , putting my full weight on it and using the seatbelt retracting mechanism . but maybe i 'm still not doing it right . the base is narrower than my evenflo 's was , so maybe that 's why ? so i need to contact babytrend and see if they have any suggestions . until then , i guess i 'll take the corners slower ! overall , i have felt like this seat was a major improvement over my evenflo and even over the graco snugrides i checked out at the store . it was intelligently designed to be easy to use and adjust as baby grows . i would recommend it for sure . just make sure you strap it in tightly or use the latch system if you have it
baby	like you , i read all the reviews i could of bottles , travel systems , baby swings , cribs , etc etc etc . i loved the shape of these bottles ( very handy when needing your hand - you can prop the bottle under your chin while feeding ) , and the concept of the `` ventaire '' system made a lot of sense ! however , 2 months into using these bottles , i became fed up with having to wash all of the different parts , drying them thoroughly ( it 's a must with these things ) , and having to `` activate '' both the nipples and the ventaire plastic seal ; wasting valuable time and energy that should 've been spent with my family , catching up on laundry , cleaning the house , cooking , and grabbing naps in-between ( i also work a full-time job and did n't get home till 6 pm every night ) . the worst of all of it is that if you do n't install the vent juuuuuuust so , it leaks ... the person ( below ) who said it does n't leak if you screw it on right , has n't met me - i 'm 34 years old and do believe i have learned how to screw on a stupid cap ! it 's a `` hit or miss '' deal ... sometimes i would go a whole week without a leak and then out of the blue ... water everywhere ! ! ! ( and they 're slow leaks too , so it 's not like you would notice right away ... it took like 30 minutes before showing ) then i called playtex to ask them what the problem was , and they thought my water might be too hot and breaking down the material ... so , they kindly sent me some new ones . well , yeh , that did n't work either ! ! ! it is a great idea , but very bad design ! ! ! i finally threw my hands in the air ... and purchased evenflo 's version of the `` angled bottle '' and now i am in heaven ! ! ! do yourself , and your time , a favor and do n't waste the money
baby	did not stick to tile . sucktions were big but it just sit in the corner
baby	i 've been using this pump for ten months now and it is the main reason i 'm still nursing my little girl . i went back to work when she was four months old and started pumping three times per day . at first it was hard to try to be productive for the 20 minutes per session i was pumping because you really do have to hold the breast shield to the breast , suction is n't enough . then i got the easy expression hands-free bustier which has solved that problem . i can now do e-mail , talk on conference calls , etc . while i 'm pumping so i do n't waste time at work and continue to give my baby the benefits of human milk . i 'm able to fit four standard bottles and two of the smaller/slimmer medela bottles into the small cooler , with the ice pack so i do n't think the cooler is too small . also , i do n't think the cooler was meant to be transported in the backpack . if you do n't try to cram the cooler in the backpack there 's no problem with storage in the backpack . i also reccomend the medela micro-steam bags for working moms who choose to pump once they go back to work . also , i do n't think the suction is too hard ... yes it may be uncomfortable for the first minute or two until the pressure of engorgement has been reduced , but it is by no means painful . pain is what i experience when my daughter bites with her new razor-sharp teeth !
baby	i just bought the knobs and they are terrible ! ! ! ! i have so much trouble opening them . do not buy it ! ! ! ! it 's a waste of money , it 's better to just remove all knobs off your stove and use one when you need it .
baby	this product is a good idea however : 1 . the fill hole , is not large enough to fill the bottom of the dish with hot tap water without getting water into the serving tray . 2 . ca n't be put in the micro . 3 . extremely hard to open bottom compartment to clean . 4 . extremely hard to open and close ( i and my daughter have to use a butter knife to pry open ) . 5 . not good for a grandmother 's hands that has joint problems . 6 . does n't keep food warm for very long . perhaps going back to the drawing board would help this product
baby	i bought this mattress 3 years ago for my first child and it already tearing on the `` tear resistant '' cover material . all she does is sleep on it !
baby	this mobile is amazing . from the time she was 6 weeks old , my daughter was mesmerized by the motion and the music . she loves watching the animals and can be left in her crib for up to 45 minutes simply glued to the mobile . although it can be noisy , it does n't seem to bother her and she often falls asleep at night to the sights and sounds . a must for any nursery
baby	i purchased this item ( not from amazon ) and my child loved it ! the puppet provides hours of entertainment and the music is great , not the usual 'kid-drivel ' that usually is part of any kid item . some hbb 's come with contemporary music and i will be picking up one of those soon . highly recommended
baby	these are the greatest invention in bottles ... ever ... ..these bottles helped my daughter so much ... .no more gas , no spills or leaks ... the only downside is they are hard to clean..but who cares ...
baby	i wish i would have checked the reviews other people wrote before buying this item ! these are flimsy , thin little sheets that are not snug or even slightly fitted for that matter . i 'm definitely going to have to purchase another brand that will actually fit the play yard pad . fortunately there are other products that work better ... if this was the only option , i might as well not have a sheet on at all .
baby	just started introducing the potty to my 19 month old and he loves to sit on it and `` practice '' . so far so good ... ...
baby	i was given these wall hangings as a present . i love them and they make the room look great . we also were presented with the problem of how to hang them . there is what seems to be a dowel pocket in the back , but that seemed too complicated to deal with . therefore , my husband and i attached a safty pin to the back of each square in the center at the top . my husband then used a finish nail in the wall , and used the safty pin to hang over the nail . the pin is low enough so you do not see it or the nail the square is hanging on . it was easy to do , and the wall hangings look great ! i thought there would be a problem with getting them to be straight , but they are light enough to manipulate and stay where they are placed . i hope this helps others with this problem . i still wonder though , why on earth the company did n't foresee this problem in the first place
baby	a good friend has this for her daughter . i fell in love with it when i saw it . completely adorable and works like a charm . bought one as a baby gift as well , but i 'd kinda like one myself ...
baby	we have the one with brown trim , but i had to write a review here too because we just love this blanket . it 's super soft , the perfect size for swaddling , and nice and light and still warm for baby . we live in hawaii so we love how this blanket keeps the drafts off our son , but does n't cause him to wake up sweaty . it costs a little more than your average cotton blanket but it 's completely worth the money ! i 'd buy another in a second
baby	i loved this mattress pad when i first opened it , it 's made of soft , natural cotton and offers a nice cushion for baby . however , after washing it , i found it 's too small for the crib mattress , which is a standard size . i think they just skimped on material , or did n't pre-wash . it 's a good 2 inches too short ! it does n't have much stretch to it , so i 'm afraid i wo n't be able to use it all ! very disappointing
baby	my daughter plays with this toy at grandma 's house . theses `` instruments '' are usually the first toys she pulls out to play with . the bright colors and different noises definitely interest her . she loves to shake them and make noise . they are great little toys to throw in the diaper bag when you 're on the go
baby	i just love our snack trap cups ! my 19 month old has been using them for 4 or 5 months and enjoys `` doing it himself '' . they 're great for shopping , driving , or anywhere ! absolutely no spills ! highly reccommend this product ! -happy mom of 1 so fa
baby	i was so excited to buy my son a potty seat . he is two and has been using it since he was about 22 months . he picked out the pooh and loved it and i love the splash guard . unfortunately , the seat tips when he leans over to pick up a book from a bucket on the floor . he is not leaning over to the floor , the books are about 1 and a half feet from the floor . this seat is quite tipsy
baby	i received a swaddleme as a gift . the first problem i discovered was that even with the small size i had received that when i wrapped it around my son , the velcro pieces did n't meet . in other words , the wrap was too large . i attached the velcro at the tightest position possible but my son still managed to squeeze his little arms out the neck - not a pretty sight . the next problem i ran into is that while the bottom of the wrap is supposed to support the baby 's feet like a womb , my son out of frustration to get out of it would just bust the bottom completely out so that his legs were completely exposed . in fact , he tore the velcro that secures the bottom pouch to the top . a friend recommended the miracle blanket and although it looks like a straightjacket it works and he has never busted out of it . it is one size fits all because of its design which is helpful as well
baby	i bought these strap covers : 1. because my daughter 's neck was being rubbed raw by the straps of her snugride , and 2. because i could get them in pink and she would no longer be confused for a boy all the time ! this product solved both problems . when i took them out of the packaging and realized how big they were i was pretty concerned that my daughter would be uncomfortable even though they are really soft . luckily , she adapted easily to them and i think she even likes having them there because she can kind of chew on it and they also hold her head up like a travel pillow when she falls asleep in her carseat
baby	do not order this item ! i ordered and returned this item four times due to cracked pieces . storkcraft either has very poor quality control or an inability to provide adequate packing to avoid shipping damage . i refuse to reorder a fifth time so now my nursery will have to have mismatched furniture . what a disaster and diappointment
baby	i used the older type bed rails with my now 6 year old son ( that does n't overlap the mattress ) and he had fallen inbetween the mattress and the bed rail quite a few times . i remember one particular instance when he was so wedged in there that i was panicked and thought he had suffocated . i was extremely happy when i discovered this one for my 1 year old daughter that transitioned to a big bed . she is now two and i have n't had one problem with it . i at one point had three on her bed . i went down to two as i pushed her bed up against the wall which only left 2 sides open . i have not had one problem with them . i take them off her bed and use them when we travel . i can sleep at night not worrying that she is going to fall inbetween . i wish they had these when my son was younger :
baby	b.o.b . rocks . bob is very high quality and has held up extremely well for us after nearly 2 years of use . we 're a little attached to bob in our house . let me tell you the revolution is the stroller to get . we bought it right after our baby was born , choked up $ 40 or so for the infant seat bar and have used it as our primary stroller ever since . even in the mall , department stores , etc it 's great . baby gets a smooth ride and daddy likes it because it 's agile and almost effortless to push . i see hundreds of bugaboo strollers around and i must admit they are nice but b.o.b is my choice because of price and you can go more places with him . our other seldom used stroller is a graco something or other and i do n't even know where it is . however i 've used it enough to compare it to bob when collapsing it and putting it in the car . i must say bob is easier and faster to fold and go . one downside might be that the storage compartment under the seat is smaller than some of those jumbo strollers . however , bob is built like a tank . we travel with bob a lot through airports ( yes bob fits through most airport xray 's while normally collapsed but sometimes i have to take off the back wheels which is easy ) and we hang stuff off of bob 's handlebars and even carry our jumbo car seat on top of the sun shade until we get to our car . our family is now looking for a double or tandem stroller . this get 's interesting because i do n't see us doing the duallie bob revolution since it 's a no-go in the mall , target , etc . the phil ted 's e3 buggy and double buggy are looking tempting but i do n't like that the older child sits tucked behind the stroller.. they ca n't see anything . what i wish b.o.b . corp would do is come up with an attachment to at least do the same as the phil ted 's ... .. but a tandem stroller that was a revolution would be sweet !
baby	i am so greatfull to this pump ! i was able to exclusively breastfeed two children for a year each , while working full time , taking vacations ( without the kids ) , etc . i also have the car adapter which is awesome , i was able to pump to and from my work , ( which is over an hour away ) , while driving . i only recommend that for breatfeeding/pumping pros ! the warranty is only good for a year , but mine is now three years old and still going strong . we are expecting our third child and i hope my pump holds up for another year , if not i will still probably spend the money on another pump like this one ! best of luck
baby	i 've bought this tub thinking that i can just fold it up and store it under the sink . but that 's not how it works . it take many steps to fold and unfold it , one of them ivolves inflating the seat ! the mechanism for snapping it in place when it 's unfolded looks like it would break if it was used a couple of times . also , the plastic inflatable seat smells like all of the plastic inflatable things , probably not very pleasant for a little baby . i am returning this item
baby	my 6 month old got these for christmas . they were among the first toys she expressed any interest in . she loved the frog that vibrated when you pull the leg , but it broke . i emailed baby einstein and asked if i could buy a replacement for the green block because it is her all time favorite . they are sending a free replacement ! we love baby einstein and our daughter loves these blocks
baby	this was way too quiet , even on it 's loudest setting . my infant did n't benefit from it at all . the sounds are fine , and not too repetative as with some machines , but even in a small room ( really small ) i found it too quiet to be effective
baby	we originally registered for this item because we have a 2-level house , and thought this would help us from trudging up and down the stairs so much . but , since my 2-month old still `` lives '' in our room , in her bassinet , that part has not yet been an issue . however , we keep this basket in our living room , fully stocked , and we do n't even have to get up off the couch to change a diaper . ( sounds lazy , but if you already have kids , you understand ! ) the sides of the liner have pockets , which we use to hold hand sanitizer , diaper rash cream , a thermometer , baby brush , aspirator , baby nail clippers , lotion , a couple rattles/toys , and some chapstick and nursing pads for me . we put the diapers , a changing pad , and a wipe holder in the `` main '' center part . i also have two wrist rattles attached to either side of the handle , and my baby loves to look at them while she 's getting her diaper changed . ( i put the basket next to her head so she can see one of them . ) the basket itself is well made , and i have no fears of it falling apart any time soon . ( in fact , we plan to put it to other use once baby is out of diapers ! ) we have not yet had to wash the liner , but it appears to be well made , and i have no fears of it falling apart , although i am going to throw it in a laundry bag and use the delicate cycle
baby	i thought i would love this , but it just takes too much time and energy . germs can go through cloth once it is wet from saliva . then this material has been rubbed all over the cart and then i put it in my car etc . i just do n't see the difference in that and not using it . my hands touch it , baby 's hands touch it etc . i have enough to keep track of with a bag , baby , wallet , cell phone ... .i just dont have enough to keep track of a giagantic piece of material ! my grocery store has those sanitary wipes outside the store by the carts and i wipe down the handle bar ... .that is far more effective against germs . you are better off buying a $ 3 thing of purel hand cleaner than this bulky , ineffective cloth
baby	i own this seat for my son who is age 6 . it is the law in my state that children must in a booster or car seat until age 8 . the seat material is high quality and the cushioning is very comfotable . the headrest is perfect for long trips since my son can fall asleep without an annoying crick in his neck . the price is decent too . the only issue i have with this seat is the cupholders . if you have a regular sedan and want to fit others in your car , the cupholders are n't very usable . additionally , the cupholders do n't slide out very well when the child is sitting in the seat . personally , i leave the cupholders pushed in . i have another carseat for a young infant in my sedan and must fit my 10-year old in the back seat . i wish carseat and booster seat makers would instead make a mesh bag pocket hang right off the botton front for kid toys and such . furthermore , with booster seats in general , i think they are very impractical for families who need to fit 3 kids across the backseat . my son has a very hard time buckling his seat belt because he must reach to the side where space is at a premium . i would love a forward-facing booster seat with a 5-point harness that would lock into the latch loops for the older child . not only is a 5-point seat harness safer but it is much easier for a child to buckle themselves instead of reaching around to the side . as far as the options available for a child who has outgrown a convertible seat but is too small for a regular seat belt , this is a nice option .
baby	this is a thin sheet but it fits my full-size pack n play bassinet perfectly . i would recommend getting 2 of them because my son wets through it often
baby	i have used these containers and the milk escaped by the time i reached home .
baby	i shopped around for a cabana to take to the beach , for my sons first visit . i found this one , and let me tell you , it was perfect ! it was so easy to set up and take down , and it was sturdy enough to stand up to the high beach winds . i saw a lot of other tents/cabanas on the beach and this one by far was the best ; both price and durability wise . excellent find and buy
baby	i wanted to respond to the other review . if you choose to purchase window coverings from this set instead of making them or getting them elsewhere , please know that the curtains are a darker stripe ( not the tan plaid ) . but they do match the ruffle on the diaper stacker , the border on the wall hangings and quilt , the trim on the hamper , etc . it is not as if there would be this one item with an odd color or pattern
baby	our son has an especially strong startle reflex , and has to be swaddled to sleep , at all . at 2.5 weeks , he startled being able to get out of any swaddle we did , no matter how expertly done , no matter what blanket we used . so , at 1 hour of sleep , he 'd start crying and we 'd have to go in and start all over . we searched online for actual `` swaddling '' blankets and based on reviews , chose this one . what an utter miracle . we are in such debt to the dad who created this ! our son is now 12 weeks old , and we use this for each nap and for nighttime sleep . he was sleeping 6-7 hour stretches at 5 weeks , and slept 11 hours at 8 weeks . we would never have this success without this blanket . we 've periodically tried to get him to sleep without it , but his reflex is still so strong that he needs it . it took a little `` getting used to '' the method to get him wrapped up , but in no time we both were experts . and the price on amazon , with free shipping , is way better than what we paid directly through amb . i wholeheartedly reccommend this to all parents , especially new parents .
baby	when i was looking for a thermometer for my baby girl i wanted something easy so her father could use it and fast because shes one not to stay still very long . i found this one and fell in love with it . i use for it for everyone in my family . yes , i did have a problem finding the covers but that 's not a reason to not to get this thermometer
baby	i am not an expert in anything . i am an emergency room nurse though , and i hear stories of babies dying from sids . we thought we 'd try this product as the reviews are great . we love it . the sensor pad is so sensitive that it picks up his every respiration ! i would highly recommend this for every baby , as sids is a risk up until 12 months of age . i feel so much better , knowing that the alarm will sound if he stops breathing . we plan to take this with us when we travel . it is easy to use and it really works . if you buy the one with the two parent units , you can use the unit as a regular baby monitor instead , or as well
baby	we bought this booster when my son was 18 months old as he loved to sit like his parents . however , he is a very large boy ( 35 '' and 34 lbs ) and the tray could not fit over his legs comfortably . so we took off the tray so he could sit at the table , and he uses the holes where the tray attaches to stick food . we went back to the high chair without the tray - and he is perfectly happy . we use this seat when visiting relatives which is nice it is so portable , but then spend time afterwards cleaning up the food underneath the seat where he stuck the food
baby	i loved having this easy-swaddleme wrap ! it was so much easier than getting a blanket and swaddling where it might come apart . the velcro worked really well as it gave `` room to grow . '' swaddling our daughter only lasted for about a month or two , she just totally outgrew this . it was great while it lasted and it 's a fantastic shower gift
baby	i 've heard avent bottles leak but never experienced it myself . i just bought the toddler cups and 18mths spouts and both link . not just a littler either but with every use . my daughter can shake milk all over the house if she pleases . i find this odd b/c the 6mths cups do n't link at all . i think these products are very hit or miss . you may get a leaky cup or you they may work great . ?
baby	no more worries about being too short and missing the bowl . yea ! ! !
baby	unless you have an older/inexpensive bathtub , this wo n't work . the side pad wo n't open wide enough to fit on a thicker rim and the seat wo n't go deep enough . too bad . it looked great !
baby	this seems to be a decent changing pad with the exception of it not being easy to clean . i am having a real hard time cleaning it and never had this problem with other changing pads . it 's almost porous ! if you get this changing pad , plan on having a cover on it at all times to keep it clean .
baby	the first one of these i had came apart at every seam the first time i washed it . i returned it and got another i was pleased with until about the 6th washing , and now it is starting to fall apart . they just do n't seem to be well-made enough to stand up to the frequent washes that something like a changing pad cover will have to endure .
baby	i love this bra ! i have 2 , so that one is always in the wash . it is the most comfrotable thing i have ever put on . i bought it a week after my son was born and my milk came in . it was so much more comfortable then my other nursing bra . i felt so much better after i put it on for the first time . i felt like i could breathe again
baby	this bed is great because our bedroom is small and the bed fits nicely next to my bed . it feels so good knowing he 's so close . its really convienent because we have to leave town for a night and this bed folds up small enough to throw in the trunk and he will still feel at home when he sleeps . oh yeah , and its really cute
baby	unfortunately , despite the fact that it advertises that it will fit any doorway , i have high baseboards on each side of the opening and only one side of the gate adjusts to accomodate high baseboards . it was not sturdy at all , returned it
baby	i bought this sheet for my graco pack n ' play and it fits great . it 's very soft and looks great wash after wash .
baby	the strap on mine broke and i was very quickly sent a replacement . i expressed my concerns about the size of the belt ( i have a small frame and it is big on me ) and i was told a newer design was in the works and they would send it to me once it 's done . very friendly , amazing customer service , that 's hard to find these days !
baby	love this tub . the hammock attachment works well for small infants
baby	i got this for my baby girl and both she and i love it ! ! ! she does n't slip and it is really comfortable for her . she really enjoys bathtime . and , if you follow the way the hammock should be used for the size of your baby ... you will really enjoy it . i wanted this prior to my baby being born , but i read some of the reviews and i did n't buy it for her . after the first month of her using another tub , and having trouble with the product , i decided to buy this aquarium tub that i wanted in the first place . caution : please use the hammock as directed for your baby 's size . this tub is perfect if you do that ! the reviews that i read about the hammock being too small or the bump in the middle of the tub were laughable when i actually read the directions before use . please read the directions . both you and your child will appreciate that you did
baby	we really enjoy this travel system . having a car seat that fits into both the base and the stroller allowed us to leave our sleeping daughter undisturbed when moving her in/out of the car . being off of work for 3 months , i did n't have to feel cooped at home when i could easily take my daughter to the store or the park . as big as the stroller is compared to umbrella strollers , we still prefer to take it , because the diaper bag and other items fit easily underneath , the seat-back folds down ( allowing sleep or diaper changes ) , and it has three cupholders , 2 side pockets that can hold other items ( burp cloth , bottled water , toys ) , and a little compartment for sunglasses or cell phone . the basket underneath is accessible hands-free by pressing up or down on the basket with your foot . the stroller fits in the trunk of our compact saturn 4-door , or if necessary , in the front passenger seat ( upside-down to fit in the wide wheels , which are anyway relatively easy to remove ) . the loaded stroller is easy to guide with one hand , so i can push it if i happen to be carrying my daughter . the stroller is sturdy and smooth enough to take down the street , on paved park paths , and we always use it on the packed sand at the beach ( it even works over the brief path over the unpacked sand , if you go backwards ) . in her car seat in the stroller , she could get complete protection from the sun and light rain with the two canopies , although i found that a draped blanket allowed for more air flow . we took the whole system on a 10-day trip , which included a flight out of town , and i felt like our load was lighter than those we took before our daughter was born . at 6 months , she has just outgrown the car seat ( but she 's basically off-the-charts in her height/weight ) , but we still use the stroller now that she can sit up . drawbacks , all fairly minor : not easy to close stroller one-handed . wheels are wider than the carriage appears from the top , so i 'm always banging the wheels on something . it takes a few minutes to remove/replace washable carseat cover , but this is probably necessary due to the straps . as with any carseat , we would suggest getting help by certified people with proper installation of the carseeat in your car ; we had many questions on installation , particularly since our car lacked the latch system . we purchased a second base so we did n't have to remove the one in our car for our trip or for our babysitter 's car
baby	absolutely love it , and it 's a great quality too . for this price ? ? ? ? i just ca n't believe it ! !
baby	we 've used this since my daughter was about 7 1/2 months old ; she 's now 2 1/2 and we 've never had any problems with it . this is the best stroller for quick trips to the mall , park , etc . the sunshade is great and the built in carrying strap is a good idea too . we 've never used the rain cover , so i ca n't comment on that . it does n't have a storage basket , but i do n't know many umbrella strollers that do . for longer trips , we just take our full size combi stroller if we need the storage or full recline option . i would definitely recommend this stroller for a light `` quick outing '' stroller to keep in the car .
baby	i bought this extra car seat base for my mom to use in her car and it works great ! now i do n't have to switch the whole seat when mom takes the baby . i am very happy with this purchase
baby	this item is a godsend and one of the most useful things i received ! i can not imagine my day without it ... my daughter loves it !
baby	while sometimes this works well , i 'm frequently woken up in the middle of the night to static that was n't there when i went to bed . it does n't matter what channel it 's on . i also get a random drumroll sound frequently . if you like being woken up in the middle of the night because your monitor is a piece of crap , then i highly recommend this
baby	i think for your money you get a great value for this playard . it comes with an interactive musical toy that no other playard comes with anything like this . it also comes with overhead bars that you can hang toys from and the baby can play with . the mattress seems very comfortable and i bought this playpen because the bassinet part looked more reinforced than the others . it has bars that snap in place and also has plastic parts that hang over the tops . the mat can also be used as a playmat on the floor with the overhead bars
baby	i bought this chair because of the great reviews , i hesitated at spending so much , but figured that all the features would be worth it considering my son would be using it for a couple of years . pros : i like that i can roll it around to the table , or to the sink to clean up after meals . the height adjustment is easy and convenient . the cons : folding it up did n't quite work as i thought it would . it did n't lock into the folding postition ... and did n't really save that much space . i would prop it against the wall , and hope that no one knocked it down . we finally stopped folding it up . the toys that connect to the tray were too dangerous for my son , as he would usually hit himself in the face with them when he was younger , by the time he was older , i did n't really need them . the battery operated toy has a funny smell to it whenever it 's been running for a while . he did like it ... but the buttons were too hard for him to press when he was younger . my son discovered at 7 months how to pull off the extra tray that can go into the dishwasher , so we do n't use that . he 's 13 months now , and last week discovered how to disconnect the tray itself and fling it off of the high chair . i washed the seat cover per the instructions , and half the time did not use the dryer , even though it said it could go into the dryer , and now the seat is bubling and cracking ... i have to place a cloth diaper in the seat to protect my son 's legs . if i had not spent $ 90.00 on the chair i would not be as disappointed ... but he 's only used it for 7 months .
baby	i like this because it is a nice construction . i bought the white and it blends in nicely . i just wish it was a little higher . we have a newer construction home and the bathroom counters are high so it is still too low for her to wash hands by herself for now .
baby	i bought this right before my daughter was born and have used it every day since she was born 4 months ago . a week ago it just stopped working . i really liked this steamer and it had served me well but now was just not turning on anymore . so i went out and bought the exact same steamer . i used it for 2 days and then on the third day , yesterday , it would n't turn on anymore . i 'm taking it back today and getting something else
baby	i bought two potties before i realized that my boy had a big bottom and most other potties have really small opening and no pee guard in the front . i broke down and bought this . this does n't have the bells and whistles like some other potty . but it 's beauty is its simplicity . he is able to sit and do his business , carry the urine/poop container to the toilet and rinse it all by himself ( he was not even 2 yet ! ) . i would highly recommed the potty training book `` potty training in less than a day '' . it 's out of print but you might find an used copy on [ ... ]
baby	the zanzibar collection is bright and cheerful . . . animal images are unusually cute . i mounted the wall hangings with velcro so they can be taken off the wall . the baby enjoys touching them and seeing them close up
baby	i thought i 'd try this monitor since it was a 900mhz and had a far range . well , i have problems similar to sara 's . when i used the alternate channel to avoid the intermittant loss of signal and beeps , i would get horrible static when my cordless phones rang or were being used . when there was no beeping or loss of signal it 's reception was clear . that 's why i gave it a 2nd star . this product is going back to the store tomorrow and i will continue my quest to search for the right monitor
baby	do not like this product it is very hard to get rail under bed pops out of rails track and it is sooo hard to get back in trac
baby	i am a new grandma . the size and portability are a plus . i was surprised that it came with a mattress . i had n't read that in the description
baby	i bought this stroller after having a 7 year old peg perego hand me down . i loved the old one but it looked like it had one thousand miles on it , as a friend told me so i gave it to my mom to use . i knew it was important to get a good stroller that would last rather than buying cheap ones . i am a very price sensitive , i shop at consignment shops , etc and i still feel the money spent is worth it ! the reason i like this stroller : 1 . you can guide it with one hand . 2 . there is a spot for bags , etc underneath . 3 . the cup holder for mommy and child . ( this is an extra accessory ) 4 . it 's lightweight and you can pop it open and closed easily . 5 . the five point harnes
baby	these breast pads are sooooo different from the johnson johnson product . they do n't absorb your milk , which means it still gets all over your clothes . the do n't have adhesive , which means the pads move all over the place . generally , just a waste of money . you might as well use toilet tissue : ) .
baby	i purchased this sterilizer about two weeks ago , and i have used it all of two times . it creates a horrible mess with water running everywhere when the lid is lifted , and i really had to wonder if the bottles were actually sterilized . i am terribly disappointed with this product , and truly caution those of you who are thinking of buying this to run from it like the wind
baby	this sleepsack keeps our little bundle warm toasty on those cold san francisco nights . it is really easy to use to move from the carset to the stroller . i do wish it zipped up just a little higher on the sides , but it 's the best thing around we 've seen .
baby	this is a good quality item for the money . i love that the rails fold down so it is easy to make up the bed and change the sheets . i just bought a second one for grandma 's house !
baby	my son was a very fussy bottle eater . he would never finish his bottle until i switched to a faster flow nipple . now he finishes his bottle and is a much happier eater . he became frustrated that the milk was n't coming out fast enough for him and with the faster flow it was perfect . he is much more content after a feeding and more relaxed . now we are both much happier and look forward to each feeding
baby	i registered for the entire locomotion collection before my son was born and have been very happy with it . i love the theme , but the mobile was a big disappointment . it did n't fit the crib properly and although my husband tried to figure out a way to install it without any type of conversion kit available , he just could n't attach it safely and we ended up returning it . also , although the mobile matches the theme , i found that the colors were n't very stimulating . we bought the tiny love symphony in motion mobile instead and although the colors did n't match , our son got many months of enjoyment and stimulation out of it .
baby	i ordered this three times and each time the same piece was broken . the first two times i ordered it through walmart.com because it 's cheaper , but they would n't replace the part . the third time i ordered it through babyage.com and was able to replace the part , but i 'm still waiting on it . this is a beautiful armoire and matches my nursery set , but it 's a major pain . i originally ordered it in july and to re-order and send it back three times has taken 5 months . my son is now 3 months old without an armoire or any kind of dresser
baby	i bought this pump when i was going to a concert and knew i would need to pump while i was out to avoid discomfort and leakage . this pump fit in my purse and was easy to use . i just slipped out into the bathroom and pumped . it was silent and no one even knew
baby	i love how wide they are . this makes them much easier to clean and to handle . since they are shorter i can fit them on short shelves in my fridge when i use the stopper caps on them . i can also fit them in my milk cooler in my breast pump because they are short . my baby is able to hold them with ease since they are wider than other bottles . her arms do n't have to stretch as far . i have n't had any real problems with these bottles . i was weary to use them after a friend complained about the leaking problem . i went ahead with them because my sisters said they did n't have any problems with them . they have leaked twice but only because i did n't screw the lid on all the way because my hands were wet . any bottle will leak if you do n't screw the lid on sufficiently . i have used plenty of other brands that has worse leaking issues when i watched my twin cousins . we tried three different brands and were n't ever really happy with any of them
baby	how annoying to pay $ 25 more here than at walmart . same price at babies r us . is it really the same exact thing ? very frustrating .
baby	this is not a good product unless you 're willing to screw one of the parts into your door , which we were not since it was a newly installed hi-quality door ; and the way the door was designed was not conducive to doing so . as a result , the double-backed tape which was required for the use of this product quickly came off . you ca n't really expect a piece of plastic which is held to a wooden door with just two-sided tape to withstead the pressures of a person ( large or small ) trying to open the door . it just is n't going to hold up . it 's a nice try , but in the end was a waste of my money
baby	i bought this mirror because my son hates to ride in the car . i thought the lights and music would distract him . after about 1 minute of hearing this annoying lady sing , i have decided that i would really rather hear my son cry . it is far less irritating . the remote is completely useless because you have to press the button on the mirror in order for the remote to work . what genius engineered that ? also , it is to heavy and it folds in the center after being in place for about 15 minutes . do n't waste your money ! !
baby	i agree with the other one-star reviewers here -- had i come to amazon first , i would not have wasted my money . i got these because our two-year-old grandson was staying with us and , being a curious kid who likes to push every button and turn every knob in sight , he was soon trying to turn on the gas oven and stove . so we got and installed these covers . within minutes he discovered them -- and became even more fascinated with the stove ! he immediately began spinning them around on the knobs , and it took less than a minute for him to figure out that if you pull upward , the cover and the knob come right off together ! now he had a fascinating new `` rattle '' to carry around -- and probably lose my stove knob in the bargain . our solution ? we took the real knobs off the stove , period . we keep them in a high cupboard and only get one out when we need it to cook . as for these clear covers , they 're are still in the closet -- maybe i can use them to display insect specimens or something ? useful as knob locks they are not
baby	do n't waste your money on this high chair . by the time your infant can safely sit in it , they will have almost outgrown it . you 're just paying for the name brand , not the quality . stick w/ a graco instead
baby	an ok gadget , but a large coffee cup with water heated in the microwave works just as well . it does not have an automatic shut off , so the water in the unit eventually evaporates leaving the exposed heating coil . must unplug the unit after each use to prevent this
baby	i thought this product would be helpful for sleeping , since it was recommended from a friend . however it does n't work for me . i took it out of the box and it was just in a plastic bag . after trying it for 5 minutes i decided that i did n't like it and tried to return it . the company would only issue store credit because i `` opened '' it . what a rip off
baby	the product is flimsy , the step is too close to the toilet to be practical for a child to step up on , the deflector is not tall enough to deflect any urine , and the seat is too large for a toddler . my child does not feel comfortable using this potty
baby	i bought this for my daughter and i too had one light that worked , my husband had to take light apart and play with the wires and somehow got the lights to work . i am not crazy about the bar where the blocks go because it keeps falling off along with the hood on the front of the bus . my daughter barely plays with it and the music only plays when we turn the bus on . needless to say i am very disappointed with this toy
baby	the fabric is soft and cushion , and what 's most important it provides good support for my baby . she loves it
baby	i really thought these were the cutest bumper pads , but after hearing over and over again how you should n't use bumper pads because of risk of suffication , i decided it would n't be worth the risk to put them on the crib . i do n't think there are enough ties on them to hold them securely for one , and even if there were i would n't be comfortable with the thought of my daughter getting her head caught up under them . she has been able to scoot across her crib since she was a newborn so there was never an ideal time to use these . again , cute for the nursery set up pre-baby , but i would n't use afterwards
baby	my daughter had to stay in the hospital for 3 weeks . she got very used to being swaddled , but after 4 kids i still can not do it right . this blanket makes her so comfortable she sleeps 5 to 6 hours at night at 3 weeks old . when both the blankets were in the wash she would n't sleep that long . she was up about every 90 minutes just wanting to be held . thank god for this blanket it lets me get some sleep
baby	i will admit that i had absolutely no desire to sterilize bottles the old fashioned way ( boiling water in a pot on the stove ) so when i saw this product over seven years ago i bought one immediately . i loved that it was so effortless ! pay attention to the instructions that tell you how much water to use based on your microwaves wattage . no one wants to wonder if the bottles are sterilized or so-so when it comes to their child , so read the instructions . i also purchased another when my second daughter was born because i gave my sister the first one . my only issue is that because of its small size ( it has to fit in the microwave after all ! ! ! ! ) , you have to really stack the bottles , nipples , etc . in a way that utilizes all of the available space . once again , the instructions clearly tell you the best way to stack . so , if in your sleep deprived , hormonal state you actually manage to read that stupid small instruction booklet you will save yourself a lot of heartache
baby	even though it comes with instructions , it is way too complicated to use . i was hoping to use it around the house but you need to know some acrobatics and balancing skills to get the baby securely in this thing . not to mention , it shrunk 2 feet after i washed it ( following the instructions , mind you ) . now i have to tighten it in the back versus the front . it 's now destined for the donation pile . the baby bjorn is easier to use .
baby	my son hated this mat at first , then he played in/with it for about 5 days ... after that , it got old ! mighty quickly . my son is now about to make 5 months old , and he does n't even want to look at it . waste of money for me
baby	i was so excited to find a portable potty b/c we like to travel and my son is finally potty training . well i opened it for the first time about 4 months ago and what a disappointment ! my son is 2 and absolutely could not stand sitting on this the first time . it 's too small and pinches . i tried to maneuvere his bottom so that it would be more comfortable . no positioning worked . if your child has a tiny bottom then go for it , otherwise , skip this one
baby	this was the second pump i purchased . i was hoping that it would turn out better than the first brand i bought . this pump is a pain in the neck to put together and the pump that is not hooked to the ac plug in is much weaker than the other side . the motor died out after 2 weeks of use . this pump is not meant for everyday use . i just bought a medala and i hope to have a better expeirence with it
baby	i bought this same mattress in 2004 for my first son , and we never had any problems . easy to clean and firm ; yet soft enough for my son to sleep through the night starting at 3 months . when we were surprised at the news of a second , i bought this from amazon on sale -- the fabric design is different ( blue and white checks ) , but otherwise it seems the same to me . but one comment : if you do n't get it on sale here you might try to buy it in store because the shipping is around $ 20 . it depends on what you 're willing to pay for convenience
baby	i bought this thinking it would work on public restrooms larger toilets for my toddler and it does n't fit at all ! if you are using just for home-sized potties it is fine except it heaves a little in the center but do n't get it for travel as it does n't work for that
baby	this pillow is totally functional and comes in handy when traveling and space is limited . i even use it at home when just watching television . it creates a natural relaxing position , it is a must have
baby	i got this as my older son , 8 , had the regular type of wedge . this one does n't keep my new infant from going from a side position to his back , nor does he stay at the same height on it . every night he slides down from his head being towards the top to his head being between the wedges . this to me is a tremendous suffocation hazard . i was very excited to get this as a gift and had even registered for it , but have been very disappointed with it 's performance . also , the foam lost its bouyancy after less than a month . there 's an indentation where i laid my son .
baby	so many convertibles car seat to choose from but the britax marathon name kept coming up in every online review as well as every online forum . i was very pleased that the marathon can handle a child up to 65lbs in a five point harness . no other seat that i reviewed offered this feature . i also liked the fact that the seat was very easy to use and install with the latch and tether strap . my son fit nicely at age 7 months and the transition from infant car seat was very pleasant for him as he did not like his peg perego primo viaggio . ( ... ) they offered a great selection of colors to choose from and had the color i wanted in stock . i believe i made the best choice after very carefull review and hope that this add if published help those whom review my comments
baby	the thing you are likely to use most is the nail clipper . but it is very blunt ! ! ! and the special cover on the clipper makes cutting the nails impossible , unless baby 's nail is very very long . if i wait until the nails are long enough to cut by this thing , my 3-month-old would have scratched his face and head . i end up buying a new baby nail clipper with a big handle and magnifying glass from nearby pharmacy . that worked much better .
baby	there was a crack down the side where it was put together and nicks in the wood . we did n't have time to send it back and they only offered us 20.oo for a discount . very dissastisfied ! will never order form here agai
baby	i chose this bottle system for my son after reading so many great reviews , and even bought one and ran it through the dishwasher to test for leaks ... no leaks ... they worked well , until recently . my son is 4 months old and they all leak . constantly . i fill one up to put it in the diaper bag and within a half hour it 's empty . they are n't very durable , the plastic on the rings is actually breaking off and now i 'm going through the struggle of trying to find a new bottle system that my son will take ( i hate the liners ) ... and they never did reduce the amount of air in the bottle at all . do not buy these bottles unless you want to buy a completely new system in 4 months
baby	we received this toy as a gift when our son was born . it was installed on our crib once and was removed once to replace the batteries . when i went to put it back onto the crib , i noticed that the plastic straps that affix it to the crib were cracked and starting to break . i need to stress that this toy was only affixed to the crib one time and my son never pulled on it or put stress on the straps at all . also , like other reviewers have stated , the company recommends removing it from the crib at 5 months of age - yet that 's when my son started interacting with it , so it 's a little age-inappropriate . i contacted the company about the straps to see if there is an at-home repair kit or if they offer a replacement ... i 'll repost if i hear from them .
baby	this product was great in the first few weeks after we brought the baby home . while others have said that the velcro is very loud for late night diaper changes , i found that i could keep it velcro 'd on the top and just slip her legs out through the bottom . my daughter really liked this , but quickly outgrew it . at just one month old she did n't want her arms tied down , so the usefullness of the product is limited . for a baby who loves being swaddled , this is an indispensible item . i 'll pass mine on with our hand-me-downs . you never can tell which baby will want to be swaddled
baby	the freedom potty trainer looked like such a good idea , but the plastic is very flimsy , and when set in place , it just barely reaches the floor . it 's a pretty unstable situation . a separate kids toilet seat and footstool would be far better
baby	i tried several different bottles with my daughter and these have worked wonderfully for us . we actually came across them when walmart stopped carrying the parent 's choice anti colic bottles we had been using which are similar in design . these bottles really seem to decrease the amount of air my daughter takes in while she 's feeding . this is a blessing as she has had problems with gas since birth . she also has reflux . i ca n't tell you if the bottles are a major factor in her improvement in that area because she is now on meds . however , i have to think they 've helped a bit . they are also comfy to hold for me . i 've read a lot of reviews that talk about leaking . i had this problem once and that was because i heated the bottle with the valve system in it . so , i learned to not do so and have not had a problem since . they are a bit pricy , but i believe that you get what you pay for . lastly , i do n't think that the small parts are difficult to wash . yes , it 's a bit more time consuming if you do n't have a dish washer , but for us , it 's been well worth the extra time
baby	our 21-month old daughter has been using this tub since birth and we love it ! it does hold water and she can splash around and play with her toys . the sunctions are great since they do stick pretty good to the tub . easy to clean and easy to put away when my husband or i need to use our regular tub
baby	i love this shade ! i am the mother of 2 girls , alice 7 and samantha 22 months . i never had anything like this for my oldest . it makes such a difference . the little one wo n't go out without it ! even though i always used sunblock on alice , her skin is still so much darker than samantha 's ; i really believe it is because of the shade . i looked into a lot of other brands before choosing this one and i think it is the best one on the market . the others are made from nylon/lycra and i do n't think that would hold up as well as this one does . thank you protect a bub
baby	these wall hangings are lovely . the different textures are very cool . maybe mine were different than everyone elses , but they came with little ribbon loops on the back , and i do n't get why there 's an issue hanging them . they 're very very cute , and look adorable in the room .
baby	i have n't been able to find the sizing info . for the sleepsacks on this site , so i called the right start ( they also carry them but for $ 24.99 ) and they said that the large size is for 22-28 pounds . just thought i 'd put this info . out there for everyone - hope it helps
baby	recieved the gate with parts missing . when i notified amazon , they indicated repair/replacement parts were not available and i would have to return and reorder the product . as my wife needed it , this was not possible . this is not a reflection of amazon but on hte manufacturer
baby	for some reason the product was not delivered , ups returned it . this was send for charity . after many emails and phone calls , the company refuses to respond or refund the money . shipping was more than the product
baby	i have used many infant tubs and i love this one ! it folds so nicely i keep it in the kitchen pantry . it fits in the sink , and i keep the faucet running like a little shower , and i can rinse her with fresh water . i actually think the angle is great for an infant , but with a newborn i use one of those `` yellow bear sponges '' in the tub for extra support ( but i use one with all the infant tubs i have used ) .
baby	i bought this cover thinking that anything to cover the cart would be the same . other covers i 've seen just slip on , this one has to be tied on . also , it does n't cover the entire cart . there is an opening , that my baby 's fingers always find , where he can touch the icky cart handle . not a great product . spend the extra money and buy the better one
baby	this bag is great for a short trip . it has enough space for a few pampers , up to 2 bottles ... it depends on how well you can compact objects into a space . im a pro . with packing things away neatly in a small space so this bag works good for me !
baby	the base seems to be high quality . it is sturdy and easy to install . it is very easy to attach and unattach the car seat . other than being pricey , there is no complaints
baby	after seeing the latest consumer reports article on infant car seats , i immediately replaced my britax companion with a graco snugfit . the britax had previously been highly rated , but the latest test trashed it . we were surprised , becuase it is the first seat we have owned ( on our 3rd kid ) , that really was rock solid snug once installed . i bought a graco snugfit , and i have nothing good to say about it . no matter how tight i got the straps attached to the latch in my 2006 honda odyssey , i could still flip the seat up and side to side with very little effort . for now , i 'm sticking with the britax
baby	this stroller is the best 250.00 that i have spent in a long time ! ! we live in texas and were using a regular double stroller to walk the dog with our 2 daughters ( aged 16 mo 's and 3 ) around a one mile loop in our neighborhood . depending on weather and moods sometimes we 'd do 3 laps . it was such a chore pushing that old stroller up and down our neighborhood hills . plus , i can actually jog or even run ! ! ! i ca n't tell who loves it more , me , the dog , or my girls . it 's light , easy to steer , worth every penny . plus , i love the fold out visors for shade for the girls . oh , and it was incredibly easy to put together
baby	do n't bother , it does n't fit at all ! ! ! ! ! ! plain and simple ... just do n't bother
baby	this item is worth more than the cost ... it is a most have at home with a new born baby ... ..expecially 1st time parent like me ... ..i can get to do other things once my baby is asleep ... and i can even hear my baby 's heart beat when am somewhere else in the house ... ..worth more than trhe cos
baby	i bought this for my 4month old for christmas , i liked the pretty , bright colors and the sounds the foot pad would make.. she was a little small when i put her in , but nothing a thin blanket tucked around her for support would n't fix , and a pillow under her feet . she was n't heavy enough yet to push the foot pad to make noise , all of those things she would grow into though . the part i could n't over look though is how close all the toys were to her head and how hard the toys were . she tried to chew on the see-saw ( teething , everything goes to the mouth ) and it was too hard and hurt her gums so crying she jerked her head back and bumped it on the mirror behind her . it was a pitiful sight . poor baby . i do n't know why they did n't allow just a little more tray space and curved that silly bar out more so they would n't bump their heads . i think a little more thought put into the product and it could be a great toy , but as it is now i think it 's just a little too `` rough around the edges '' . i took mine back to the store and then bought an evenflo , she fits in it much better and so far she loves it .
baby	the third time i wore it , as i tried to zip the bottom-most compartment with one hand ( other arm is carrying my 14-month-old ) , the plastic piece on the main strap simply broke , and pieces just flew off and now it is completely unusable . i do not recommend this product because of its poor construction
baby	i had a fabric seat saver for my leather seats before . needless to say fabric does n't protect leather very well . i ended up with deep depressions in the leather . hopefully the leather will go back ( fingers crossed ) . the firm bottom piece seems to work well to prevent any more indentations from showing up . and both of the carseats are as secure as ever . i have the rear and forward facing models .
baby	i also had the older diaper champ and it broke so i got this new one , `` new and improved '' ! i do n't know if they 've ever tested this product . it 's impossible to get the diaper bag out of the diaper champ . it 's big from the bottom and small from the top so when you try to get the bag out of it , it always gets stuck and if you try harder then the bag rips ! it 's absolutely horrible product . new or soon to be moms - do not buy this ! !
baby	a snap to install , my only complaint is that when you press the button to open the gate , it waits about 5 seconds before you can latch the gate again . **problem** forget about using the remote if you have more than one of these gates in the house -- one remote will opena ll of them ... pretty stupid design . :
baby	limited space in our townhome , and this hook on chair has been wonderful for us . this is our `` highchair '' . make sure you look at the clearance dimensions if you have a lip under your table . the chair arms ( attachments ) may not clear the lip . strong , sturdy , easy to clean . knowing we can remove it and take it with us for a weekend visit is one less thing to worry about . great travel drawstring bag . great price ! ! ! great product . if you take the time to read the instructions and not force things that should n't be forced , this seat will work out for you . something for the manufacturers , if they read these comments ... personnal prefrence . the harness straps should be a diffrent color then the seat . very hard to see/find when putting a baby in the seat , and its 5:00 in the morning
baby	i love this sack . and highly recommend it especially if your child likes to kick the blankets up over their heads . before i purchased this i found her sleeping with the coveres over her head twice ! ! !
baby	ok so i purchased this when my son was 4 months old . i always thought it was pretty neat , but figured he would n't sleep in it , because it seems to glide too slow . my son would n't sleep in anything , but his swing . i wanted to get him something bigger that may slightly imitate the swing that i know he 'll sleep in . so based on reviews i got this product . at first i was a little disappointed , because at night as soon as i laid him in it he would start too fuss like he did everything else , except his swing . i just figured maybe i should have bought it a couple of months ago . but , what i did was put one of his big blankets in it and laid him on top of it and whadduya know ? he sleeps in it more than his swing now ! i guess it was n't as cushiony as he wanted it to be . i kind of noticed that too , when i got it that it appeared not to be as cushiony . another disappointing thing is that the music volume is a little loud even on the lowest setting , so i do n't even use it . aside from that it 's great . the motor noise does n't seem to bother me or my son . it is n't very loud to me . but anyway he sleeps in it , which allows me to get more me time and sleep time at night . i would say my money is well spent
baby	i really do n't like this high chair at all . my little girl is 10 months old and 19 lbs and she can not sit in this chair without me putting a pillow or towel under her so that she can reach . when sitting on the regular seat , she is so low that she can not get her arms above the tray to feed herself . this is a huge pain because i have to constantly take out the pillow or towel that she must sit on top of ... out to clean . a 10 month old should be able to comfortably sit in a high chair . i have had her in friends high chairs that are a graco and she fits perfectly . if i could do it over , i would have opted for a less expensive model that she fits in properly . do n't buy this product !
baby	i was very excited to try out this tent at the beach . we got it set up and my 4 month old was taking a nap in it out of the sun . everything was great until the cabana suddenly collapsed on him . one of the supports had broken . it was the first time i 'd used it . i was very disappointed
baby	i 'm very dissappointed with this expensive pump . now i 'm looking for another one . it 's difficult to pump if you have large nipples . you have to buy extra sheild which costs extra . it 's noisy . it loses suction.the milk backs up to the tubing and gets moldy.i clean the parts everyday . i have contacted medela a few times to troubleshoot the pump and they eventually sent me another motor ( great customer service ) . it worked for a few months and now the same problem is happening . i guess it works for some and not others . now i 'm in the hunt for another pump since i want to exclusively give my baby pure breastmilk for her first year .
baby	there is a place for everything in this drying station . i use wide mouth bottles and it 's a little tight on space , but it works great for me . it 's convenient on the counter when i have to grab a bottle for the baby .
baby	great buy . my daughter loves this stroller . i like the option of the back padding that you can fold during hot season so the air can go though . your child never gets hot or sweaty at their back . i would recommend this stroller . maneuver really well , i can do it with my 1 hand , fold one hand . great , great stroller .
baby	i have not gotten to use this swing yet , but i just wanted to say that assembly was easy and after i had it all put together i played with the toys on the tray and it was the coolest thing ever : ) i highly recommend
baby	you really do get what you pay for . i got this for around $ 53 but i did not like this product at all ! the bumper is very scratchy and cheaply made . the comforter is pretty cheap too . the only thing i saved was the sheet and crib skirt which really only sit in a drawer as backup
baby	my son is tiny- born at 5lbs 6oz and very much a preemie . i simply can not imagine putting him in the infant seat without this . it keeps his entire body in place- not just his head . it provides great support and the soft white fuzzy side is very warm ( we havnt used the other side yet . ) my only complaint is its a bit akward to get the shoulder straps in the correct place around baby- but thats mostly because our baby is still very tiny . once he ; s bigger and we can move the headpiece up it shouldnt be a problem
baby	$ 52.00 less weighted down by cash , and i was on my way with what was the most expensive non-video monitor available at the local target . surely being the most ridiculously expensive with all the highlighted bubbles beside features like `` clear reception '' and `` no interference '' i would be able to hear the baby 's every move from every household location and beyond . we hooked it up in short order , turned it on , and *screeeech* . apparently a volume level that might permit us to hear the baby one room away would also cause some sort of massive interference between monitor and reciever . we tried shutting that monitor off , and plugging the second in the kitchen outlet - the entire length of the house away . no screeching , but it sounded like someone speaking from inside a tin can . totally distorted , useless . you could n't tell if the baby was banging on her crib bars or if someone was moving heavy machinery about in her bedroom . we 've packed it carefully back into the box , and are hoping target will take it back without a fight . needless to say , i 'd steer clear of this one . our $ 20 safety first monitor far surpasses this one - even on its last leg
baby	we loved this product and our little girl loved it even more ! we used it from the time she was 4 months to almost 10 months . we have a nice wide doorway that we were able to put the jumper in . we never had any problems with fingers getting pinched or heads getting bumped . we believe her coordination is better because she used this so often . at just 14 months , she could jump with both feet off the ground . it is a quality product at a reasonable price . would highly recommend
baby	maybe it 's just me , but i can never seem to get it to angle just right to take an accurate temperature
baby	bought this gate to keep a small dog in a room . the entry area is not symmetrical and the gate was configurable to fit perfectly . works well , looks good and feels solid . highly recommend for this use
baby	this is a super-cute bath toy . my daughter enjoys putting her toys into the `` sink '' and then pulling them back out again . she also enjoys playing with the cute accessories that come with this . love it
baby	it worked great the first time my 14 month old son used it but the second time , he figured out how to take the lid off and spilled his cheerios everywhere . i tried it a few more times after that and got same result . the lid is way too easy to remove .
baby	i really like this -- it takes what seems like no time to read the temperature
baby	terrible , terrible , terrible . the first one broke within 5 uses ; the second one lasted about 15 uses . there have got to be better ones out there
baby	lucky for me i did n't pay for this pump but the hospital gave it to me . i could only get two drops of milk for every ten pumps . what a waste of time . you would figure the hospital would know if the pump worked
baby	i like this car seat . it is very soft for a bab
baby	i chose the lighter one based on other reviews of the wool getting all over the baby . i 'm using this one this winter but putting a blanket on top of baby to protect him from the cold . very good quality product
baby	i received a box as a shower gift , and they worked okay , unless i changed them a lot though , they ended up leaking . i was resigned to just living with wet spots , until someone gave me some of the lansinoh pads to try . i have no idea why babies r us does n't arry them , but they really need to . these things absolutely do not leak , they hold tons of liquid
baby	i would not reccomend this product . it was cheaper at amazon.com than walmart , but it took forever to get . it took two weeks for us to get it . when caption said ships 5-7 days . than when we did get it , several pieces were broken . major pieces . when i called the company , ( which i was on hold for 30 minutes ) then told me that we had so many pieces that were broken ( 5 ) that we needed to return it . i told them no , it 's over 100 lbs and i am 7mth preg . they then changed the tune and said they would ship the parts they would be here in 4 weeks . another mth . so it took almost 2 mths to get this product . it is not worth the problems . plus , nothing was labeled , and you had to figure out what pieces were what . plus , the shelves inside the unit are white , the armoire is natural but the shelves inside are white . i called the company and they said this is true .
baby	i just received this product after much research , and i am really disappointed with it 's quality . the mattres is so stiff and hard especially for a baby , and the sheets provided are like an emory board , scratchy and stiff . my baby is too long for this , so her feet fall off the edge of the mattres . i just thought it would be much better than this . looks like i will be returning it . my daughter is now sleeping in her bouncy chair , tied down at the back to reduce the bounce and with a fluffy pillow underneath it to also reduce the bounce
baby	this item is packaged horribly . if you are lucky enough to get intact a great product for a great price . received changing hutch and tower , crib and toybox intact . very happy . ordered this dresser twice , both times damaged . good luck trying to put back in crummy box to return and good luck trying to get damaged parts replaced unless you can wait 6-8 plus weeks . my suggestion is to order two dressers , take the best pieces from each , and return the rest . believe me , you will be glad you did
baby	i only have the turtle and the fishing net . turtle : the turtle was used for about 5 months while my nephew stayed with me and then was put up until my new baby would be able to use it . i dryed out all of the bath toys and they were stored in an open air toy bin for about 6 months . i finally felt my daughter was ready for toys in the bath and put the turtle in the water and noticed black stuff floating in the water . there was mold/mildew growing inside of the turtle . i tried washing it with bleach water , but more kept coming out even after repeated washings . i finally just gave up and threw it out . i had several other squirt toys stored with the turtle and none of them had the same problem . fish net : the paint on the fish net is peeling off after only 5 months use . the fish themselves are fine .
baby	pinched my daughter 's tush ( even though it was opened all the way , it bent as she was getting on ) . she never went near it again . have to be very careful as child is sitting down .
baby	the suctions are pretty weak , dont stick well to the tray . also had a hard time keeping the arch standing up . the arch kept bending forward and falling in my sons face . when i was able to get the suctions to finally stick , as soon as my son would touch it , it would bend right above the suction part and it would end up in his face . they should have added some kids of reinforcemnt so that it could stand upright all the time . i took this back the next day . i bought the sassy fascination station instead . it has a giant suction at the bottom and serves its purpose , even i had a hard time pulling it off the tray .
baby	we have taken this seat on three flights overseas and on a couple of domestic flights , as well as on many car trips at home and abroad . it is great ! it is quick and easy to install forward or backward on airplanes and in cars . on some plane seats the buckle is under the childs bottom , but the cushioning is adequate , my son has never complained . he seems very comfortable in it . `` baby bargains '' recommended this seat for travel back when my son was a baby , and i am online ordering one for my daughter right now . if you expect to travel , this seat is an essential . it is light enough that lugging it around airports , cruiseships and such is not a total pain ( although as with any seat , it is nice to have a bag , we 've done it both with and without )
baby	its definitely a practical way to carry the essentials for a baby or a kid or whatever .
baby	what more can i say ? these bottles leak all over the place . i switched to dr. brown 's , and they have been great . no leaks , and my son spits up less . do not buy avent bottles and nipples - they leak like crazy , and cause a huge mess
baby	i ca n't believe anyone would give this stroller a good review . we have 10m twins , and have been using the stroller for about 4-5 months . it 's terrible . problems : 1 . no sun protection . the visors are locked in place . unless the sun is directly overhead or at your back , it will be beating in your babies ' eyes , and you 'll need to buy a non-peg perego sunshade accessory . 2 . hard to steer . it gets stuck going across the lawn and on compacted dirt . if the sidewalk buckles just an inch ( common from tree roots ) , the stroller is stopped dead in its tracks . it 's hard to steer in a straight line , so it 's easy to get stuck when going through narrow doorways or down narrow sidewalks . 3 . it 's flimsy . the bottom of the storage area underneath stretched and sagged after a month of use . it now drags on the ground and rubs against the wheels even when nothing is in it . the cupholder broke during the first week . 4 . hard to unfold . it takes two hands to unfold and you have to give it a vigorous shake to get it to completely unfold and snap into position . do n't even think about about trying to set it up with a baby in your hands : you need both hands free to deal with this thing . 5 . bad customer support . the stroller comes with no weight/height/age suggestions . when we first tried to put our twins in it , they were swimming in it , and could n't be upright . when we called peg perego and asked how big the kids should be to use it safely , the support rep said `` do n't know . '' yes it 's lightweight and folds up nicely . but the light weight is actually a drawback ; it means the handle and legs are flimsy and wobbly -- resulting in a stroller that 's difficult to steer . my advice would be to seriously consider jogging strollers . even if you are n't an active parent -- i 'm not -- get something sturdy with big wheels to get you over the dips and bumps and cracks and patches of sand , dirt , and grass that you will encounter . if stroller size is the most important factor to you , look at `` stadium seating '' strollers .
baby	i bought this chair for my third child and wish i would 've had it for the first two as well . it is easy to assemble , easy to use and easy to clean . i like the recline feature and 5 point strap because my baby could sit/lay in it at a fairly young age . i love the wheels because i could rock him with my foot and talk to him while doing dishes or making dinner . the one hand release on the tray is a dream for moms who could use eight hands ! my son seems to enjoy the toys , too . i only wish it came with extra trays
baby	we got this seat in a different color for our first baby . we feel very secure with it . easy to install and a little hint , they try to get you to buy the second base for the snugride if you have two cars ... you do n't need it , you can fasten the seat without the base . the directions for it are on the seat . i like that we can move the canopy to wherever the sun is to directly block it , and that it 's transportable to our stroller . ( bough seperatly ) it comes with a head `` brace '' whatever those things are called to cradle the head . those never do anything , and are pretty useless , but the seat itself is great .
baby	this mirror really is n't worth the money . you 'd be better off just buying a plain mirror for baby to look in and for you to look at baby , that 's about all this thing does . the remote control has to be pointed directly at the mirror , kinda hard to do driving down the road . also , the music is n't very loud , atleast not loud enough to get baby 's attention when upset , which is what i was hoping for . and the lights are n't very bright . really ca n't see that they even light up unless it 's very dark out . also , the positioner works fairly well when baby is facing backwards , but once you turn baby around and have to attach the mirror to the back of the front seat , it does n't stay in place that well . you could spend alot less money for just a plain baby -in-sight mirror
baby	so far i have n't used much in this kit just because my son is only a month old and most the products are for older babies ( also we have n't run into issues to need it ) but i have used the nose aspirator and it 's great . it 's soft and i do n't fear hurting his nose ! i 'm very excited to use the rest of the products
baby	i replaced my baby 's old bumper with this one when she became mobile . it works fairly well in keeping her from getting her arms or legs caught in between the crib slats . the only complaint i have is that the `` short '' section of the bumper can be pushed down quite easily by the baby , thus defeating the purpose of keeping arms/legs inside the crib
baby	i think this is a great quality product , and i love the idea of it . however , i find that my son whose 7 weeks old is just not comfortable in it . it 's not very soft and it 's just so big for him right now . i can get him to sleep in it only if he 's completely zonked out beforehand . i think the mini co-sleeper might have worked better for us in the beginning . the original might be better as he gets older and can use the play pen part of it . i do have to add that directions were somewhat difficult to understand without going over them many , many times
baby	i 've tried this sling about 4 times with my now 10 week-old son . i just ca n't get it to work so that he seems comfortable . he usually cries when he is in it . he fell asleep in it once , but he looked so contorted . it 's just so tight against my body that it bends him the wrong way . and the pocket is so deep it closes over his head . and i know i got the correct size . i 've given up and am looking for a better sling . right now we use our baby bjorn several times a day , and he loves it , but it 's a little cumbersome , and i want him to be able to recline .
baby	this product definitely saves space but i 've had a hard time cleaning the tray . yes , it 's dishwasher safe but it takes up so much room in our diswasher that i end up hand-washing it . there are so many little nooks on the underside of the tray that i 'm always finding places that i misseed washing . trust me , the baby will manage to get food there too ! this product would be greatly improved if there were a smaller tray insert that popped out for washing ( i 've seen this on some highchair models ) .
baby	my baby is now 5 months old , and we 've been using the halo sleep sac since she started moving around more . i was always worried with the regular blanket because more than a few times she would wake up crying because she had kicked her regular blanket onto her face ! now , i never worry that she will soffocate or that she will be cold in the middle of the night . this product really gives me peace of mind and i 'll be sure to give this to any new parent friends
baby	i love my fisher-price infant toddler swing . i have two of them for my twin boys . they love it and i know it is safe . also is it easy to get them in and out of . lynne ambros
baby	i purchased this video monitor based on the reviews to help me care for my elderly mother who is under hospice care . it has been wonderful to be able to check on her without staying constantly at her bedside or running back and forth from one end of the house to the other . the picture quality is great and the sound is amazing - i can detect changes in her breathing from the other end of the house ! i would highly recommend one to anyone in a caregiver situation or for parents to watch over their children . it will definitely be put to use when grandchildren come along
baby	i actually got the snug tub deluxe . this version comes with inflatable rings that baby can stack on the inflatable post . it also has an attached inflatable fish that wheezes when you squeeze it . i used it for the first time tonight and my 6 month old baby enjoyed the freedom to splash and play . my only caution is to use something to keep baby from slipping . i put her baby sponge underneath her to elevate her and propr her up . this was also good to lean her back to wash her hair and to keep her from slipping . i 'm glad i bought this instead of the eurobath
baby	i love this gate one because of the height . it is high enough to even keep my three year old out of trouble . i also like that i can operate the gate with only one hand . that is great because like other mom 's my hands are often busy with something else . i would and have reccommended this product to anyone who is looking for a gate
baby	i ordered this at christmas with the free super saver shipping . the crib arrived within a week . assembly was simple and the crib feels very sturdy and stable . it 's attractive , but my only complaints are 1 ) it did arrive with about five different chipped/gouged areas in the white paint ( this was easily remedied by touching up with white paint ) and 2 ) the bolts are exposed on the crib-it would have looked better if they had provided caps . overall , i 'm very happy with the crib and the price- ca n't wait to use it for my little girl who is due in may
baby	i received this steralizer as a gift . if i had to do all over again i would have never put it on my registry . the steralizer is messy ; everytime i lift the top to remove the bottles water is everywhere . in addition i have to keep a dry towel under the steralizer to dry up the water that spills out ... there has to be a better way
baby	i was happy when this product arrived . it arrived in great time . i like the fact that it runs on a 9v battery and has the option of using two head sets . it states that it should be used in the last trimester , i am now 7 months pregnant and it still wont pick up my babys heart beat . i have even went to my appointmets with it thinking i am using it wrong . it will pick up my heart beat , but not the babys . i ca n't say it doesnt work because every woman is diffrent but it hasnt worked for me and as i mentioned it says to use it in your last trimester . the greatest thing about this is the cd 's i play them for the baby every now and then
baby	i was excited to find a canopy for my daughters car seat to get the sun out of her eyes . the ad said `` universal fit '' . well , it fit , but second size up car seats are taller and kind of lean back . when you attach the canopy , it doesent pull forward enough to block any sun . a hat better serves my child then this aparatus . it now sits in the garage with all the other failed baby devices
baby	my daughter placed this crib on her registry , mainly because of the price . she did n't want anyone spending $ 500.00 on a crib and this one matched the style she was looking for . i found this set up at a `` depot '' store and it was beautiful and sturdy , but did n't come in natural . so i went home and ordered it online . it arrived 4 days before the shower ( 8 days early from eta ) but it was shattered . the first 3 pieces we looked at were split , chipped crushed . quite a surprize considering the box was n't in bad shape . we decided to return it and buy a more expensive model ( at a local specialty store ) . amazon 's return policy was amazing , a click on the mouse and the next day ups picks up . no packing labels to print , no lugging big heavy items to post office , very simple . amazon gets 5 stars , storkcraft - 0
baby	this has to be the best investment you can make towards your child before they are born , and the results will effect them for their whole life ! it felt like a big commitment for me to have to run the program 2 times a day , and near the end of my pregnancy i was annoyed with having anything strapped across my belly , but i am so glad i pushed through . my daughter is amazing ! i am in awe at her sweet spirit and her advancement . baby plus did everything it promised and more ! here are some examples : at birth : eyes wide open , hands open , instant excellent nurser , slept 4-6 hours at night , very calm and happy , cried only when hungry . at 1 month : smiling all the time at everyone , sleeping 8-10 hrs . at night. , recognized mom and dad 's faces . at 2 months : laughing , holding head up at 3 months : pressing buttons on toys for 6mos + , rolling both directions , holding own bottle at 4 months : sitting with support at 5 months : sitting without support , drinking from sippy cup , singing , saying first words at 6 months : puts self to sleep , pulled self to standing position , creeping ... and now almost crawling . i am completely amazed at her advancements . people mistake her for being 3-6 months older than she is , and they say she is the happiest baby they have ever known . i am totally sold on baby plus
baby	i had my doubts when we first used it b/c it closes with just some toggle-like buttons and i was worried that the wind would slip through . but my baby comes out of this stroller-sleeping-bag/wrap warm every time . and we 've had a few days this winter here in the northeast that have been way below freezing with a wind chill strong enough to sting your face .
baby	i got this sterilizer because of the avent name . my main complaint is that the lid does n't lock into the base when closing . you have to use alot of power for it to close . i have to place it on the floor and stand on it for the sides to lock .
baby	in terms of pre-natal resources , this is the best i have found ! the positive results are proven . i can not think of a reason not to buy this product . every expectant parent wants the most and best for their unborn child . this system is wonderful for interacting with your child before he or she is born . you will even notice a response from your baby ! it 's very exciting
baby	this stroller holds up to 55 lbs. , unlike most umbrella strollers which only hold 35 lbs . i love the raised handle bars . they cause less strain on your shoulders and back . there is a roomy basket under the seat , which is a great bonus . the 8 wheels make it easier to steer and push over rocks or grass . once my son was able to sit up on his own , i have used an umbrella stroller exclusively . this is hands down the best one i have ever had . it is also very modern looking in black and gray
baby	we just learned in parenting class ( and i checked with my pediatrician ) that you do n't need to sterlize bottles , nipples or anything else now as long as you have a dishwasher . so save some money and do n't get this !
baby	there is no need for this item . it is a huge inconvenience to have this big stiff box in the middle of your bed . i hated having a wall between my baby and me . when i woke up to nurse , i had to take her out of it anyway . co-sleeping is intuitive , naturally safe and easy easy easy ... please do n't spend your money on this unnecessary complication of a natural arrangement .
baby	this cute turtle was terrific for about a week . my toddler loved it and enjoyed the stars and color options . unfortunately , the button you press to turn it on fell off inside the turtle after about a week of use . i was the one pressing the button when it came off , and i was n't being rough or using excessive force . we had to shake the turtle to get the button out but could n't re-fasten it easily . for a few days we stuck a finger in the small hole where the button used to be to activate the turtle , but then the rubber sensor fell off as well . with no way to turn the thing on , we threw it away . my toddler was sooooo sad , but it was worthless to us . since this is overall a popular product , i suppose we just had bad luck . i would n't buy another one , though
baby	this stool is great , right size for young child to seat on the potty . it is narrow and does n't take up a lot of room , plus it saves my back from having to pickup grand daughter to set her on the potty
baby	we have had this monitor for about 7 months now and we love it ! the peace of mind in being able to see that your little one is okay is priceless . i used to have to run up and down the stairs constantly , and i do not miss that . i can cook dinner or watch a tv show in a relaxed state without worry . it has always worked well , and it something happened to this one we would replace it immediately . the picture is clear , the sound is excellent . you do have to keep charging it if you do not keep it plugged in , but the cords are all generous in length . we would go nuts without it
baby	this is an awfully cute bedding set and i 'm very pleased with it . it arrived quickly , and is good quality , though the fitted sheet is a little thin , it will still be a good backup .
baby	my son is [ ... ] and aside from getting too big for his crib , my sister is having a baby and needs it . i was a bit concerned about making the transition for my son due to his `` crib attachment , '' but this bed made it easy as pie . it 's adorable , sturdy and fun . my little boy slept all night in his big boy bed from the very first night and we 've never had a problem ( we 've had it for a month ) . he loves to drive his match box cars up and down the tracks and stand on the toy box saying `` choo choo . '' it 's just been great ... .i 'm so glad we spent the money
baby	i just received this sleep positioner today and it is nothing like what i expected . the description makes it sound like the wedge is adjustable - but i do n't quite get how to adjust this . it also says that there is a blanket . maybe i misunderstood the description because there is no blanket here . i imagined the wedge would prop the baby up much more than it does . at the thickest layer the wedge is maybe 2 1/2 inches thick . i 'm pretty disappointed . i thought this was going to be the answer to my baby 's sleep problems
baby	this is the best product we have ever used for our little girl ( yes that includes swings and bouncy seats ) . i stumbled across it when they had just come out . she was sitting in it at 4 months . by the time she started crawiling though we couldnt use it because she was able to twist herslef and climb out of it . however ... i see now that they have an attachment for it so it can be used for self feeding . i recommend this to everyone we know who is starting their family or already have had a child . it allows the caregiver to be hands free and it helps your little one learn to be more independant faster ( which is a double edged sward ! tough fro parents good for kids ) .
baby	my husband and i just had a wonderful baby girl ( apr . 9 , 2007 ) and i simply could not live without this item . my daughter loves sleeping in it . it is light ; therefore , it can be easily moved from one room to another , as needed . you could easily travel with it ... . from hotels to the `` grandparents house . '' it can be folded compactly and easily stored ; and , there is also a handle for carrying . the light at the top is excellent for those who wish to co-sleep as well . ***obviously , do not leave your child unsupervised in it ! ** it is excellent and i highly recommend it to all parents
baby	i did n't use mine for the first two weeks of my daughter 's life because it was waaaaaaaaaaaaay too complicated ! i figured it out , sort of , but to this day when i push the diaper in the film rips . then when it comes time to change the film , the top does n't cut the film so i have to use scissors . my sister-in-law told me to register for it . why did i listen to her ! do n't buy it ! dont register for it ! it 's not worth it ! i want a refund
baby	same thing that happened to the previous poster happened to my son 's toy . the turtle cup came off after the first use ( and within 20 min ! ) . my son is 8 months old and it ca n't even withstand the pulling of an 8 month old . and a sharp screw is revealed when the cup comes off . luckily we noticed it before my son was injured , unfortunately i had to remove it immediately which of course upset my son , who no longer had his toy to play with . i would pay more for something that is quality so it is sad and amazing that companies put out cheap quality products that break immediately and expose dangerous parts . i would recommend that you do not buy this item . i now have to waste more time returning it to the store
baby	this is a great product for a few weeks , then the velcro gets really weak and your child will be busting out ! i go in to find my son with both arms out and one leg out . no matter how tight i make the blanket , the velcro comes apart . i encourage you to buy their other swaddleme blanket with the larger velcro flap .
baby	when registering for baby needs i laughed at the idea of wipes warmer - i thought what a waste ! after my newborn startled and screamed during diaper changes i rethought this . this product has been a life changer ! baby is much more comfortable now and the warmer works great . easy to use , the wipes stay moist and are easy to get out . remember to purchase the pop-up wipes however . great product . i would give as a gift .
baby	i would have given this walker 5 stars the first couple of weeks . the walker seemed great for the price , it was easy to maneuver and the baby loved it . unfortunately , the design is terrible on the sounds n'lights feature . it began fading out before the baby had time to become bored with it . after much frustration trying to get `` to '' the battery compartment to replace it , we discovered it is not designed for replacement at all . the internal battery is soldered in place . once it loses it 's original charge , you are left with a dismal fading off of the sound and a potentially unhappy baby
baby	i was very excited to finally recieve this stroller , but after i put it together ( which was pretty simple ) , it was very heavy and bulky to handle . i was looking for a stroller to accomodate my big 2 1/2 year-old and a new baby due soon . i bought this stroller sight unseen because it seemed like the perfect solution . i was not able to load it in the back of mt suv due to the size and weight , and it is very long and hard to steer . anyone considering the ionic color pattern may again want to check it out in person because the silver fabric is very shiney . it does not accomodate my evenflo carrier either , so i would have needed to also purchase the graco carseat . i am returning the stroller to amazon today
baby	i bought the avent breastshells because of my sore nipples , and a way to collect leaking milk while i was not nursing , and relieve some engorment . 1 . it is very messy when removing the colleting cap 2 . my nipples are still sore 3 . and the only way to relieve engorment pain is to nurse or to pump if i would have known about these factors i would not have purchased this product
baby	this monitor did n't work for us at all ! we heard a lot of static , and the alarm would go off too . it would n't work anywhere in my livingroom or kitchen . the alarm was always going off .
baby	i have a 3 and 4 year old and this device did little to deter or prevent them from raiding the fridge while their mom and i were asleep . a couple of good , hard yanks by your child and this device fails . this might me a good product for infants and toddlers , but if your child is over 2 years old , try something else like the lock release fridge latch by safety 1st ( but be aware that even though these are by far superior , you 'll still have to place about 3 of these safety 1st latches on your fridge door to keep the little ones from defeating them . that 's what worked for us anyway . i 'll be so glad when they grow out of this fridge fascination .
baby	i thought that this would be really helpful when it comes to making sure that i have clean nipples for my baby . unfortunately , when you read the instructions for most latex nipples , they are n't dishwasher safe , and you are instructed to hand wash . so , having a dishwasher container for nipples is pretty useless . i use mine as a container that i can airdry my handwashed nipples in . do n't waste your money
baby	the item is so much cheaper than the alternative , which is $ 200 . it was easy to use and easy to store when not in use
baby	i love this containers . first of all , i am a big fan of the isis breast pump , so these containers are perfect for me . i express into these containers -- freeze them -- thaw them out -- replace the sealing disc with the nipple -- warm it up . then my husband is ready to feed the baby . it 's one of their times together , and i get to spend time with my older children . perfect
baby	do not purchase this product if you plan to use your play yard with the bassinet . the tent snaps on in the same spot and you can not use both
baby	i purchased this to put on the changing table . i was looking for something that would fit on top of the table next to the changing mat and would hold diapers , wipes , lotions , etc . i purchased and returned two other baskets for various reasons then i found this one . it fits perfectly and holds the wipes container , several diapers , lotion , hair brush , etc . i love that it has separate pockets to hold small items so that they dont fall over . this allows everything to be within easy reach while changing the baby . the price was also reasonable . i was looking at buying one from pottery barn for twice the amount . this basket is a great buy
baby	my husband and i received this changing table , along with the 4-drawer chest and the monterey crib , as a gift from our parents . we were skeptical , because we wanted a nursery that was affordable , yet not too flimsy . we were pleasantly surprised once the pieces were put together . the pieces coordinate beautifully with the nursery , and will take our soon-to-be-born infant into childhood . and the nicest part is that you do n't have to spend thousands of dollars to have a nice nursery . my friends and family are constantly complimenting us on how great the pieces look and how sturdy they are . * the only reason i rated this 4-stars instead of 5 was because two of the drawers rubbed together slightly once assembled . it was very easily fixed by adjusting the drawer tracks , took 5 minutes . bottom line : if you are looking for a beautiful , quality nursery that is affordable , this is a great choice
baby	excellent value for money . our 8-month old enthusiastically used this seat as a travelling feeding chair as well as a floor chair and we would n't have managed the holidays without it ! this seat is strong and stable , yet easily assembled/dis-assembled . it folded flat to fit in our suitcase and has become a valuable travel companion with our young family . we purchased this on 19 dec and it was delivered prior to christmas - well done amazon
baby	this potty seat is the only toilet training item i have bought . i highly recomend it ! my daughter thinks she is a big girl on the big potty . you need a step stool for them to get up on their own . i like that the seat is sturdy enough to withstand a 30 lb . 3 ft. 2 yro . climbing up situating her self with out my help because ultimatly that is the goal this product i feel helps get to that goal .
baby	when our first child was born , my wife purchased the lower model from medela . with the second child and her having to go back to work sooner , we decided to go with this pump and are very satisfied . she uses it everyday when she is at work . the price might be higher than others , but think about all of the money you will save on formul
baby	i was a little apprehensive about ordering this product , as i read all of the negative comments . i ordered it anyway , because good comments described the potty as one that would benefit my son . when it arrived ( earlier than expected ) , i noticed that it was easy to assemble , and that because it is not made with very thick plastic , it probably would n't be a good idea to order this for big children who are potty training . my son is 18 months old , and 22 lbs , and it is perfect for him , sturdy enough for him to climb up and use the potty . he really enjoys climbing up himself , and it does encourage him to be more independent in the process . i let him look at the box , and we talked about how the little girl was going potty , and he liked seeing the little girl on the box : ) using the potty , `` just like him '' . so if your child is very big , or potty training at 3+ years , i would n't order this , they do n't need it . i would just get a stool
baby	we have gone through a few packages of the table toppers and we love them ! our toddler went from trying to peel them off the table to helping us stick them down ... .she loves to pull the paper strips off the adhesive ... .and she does n't try to pull the mat off the table until she is finished eating . we finally found the shopper toppers at toys r us and i was so excited i bought two packages ... .and they do n't work worth anything ! the adhesive on those is down the sides , not across the top where it should be , to stick on the shopping cart handle ... .in fact we 've decided that the table toppers will work better on the shopping cart than the ones made for the shopping cart . also , with only a shopper topper in our bag while out for lunch recently , we used it on the table and it worked just as well at the ones made for the table ! well done
baby	i bought this thermometer when my second son was born , thinking it would be easy to use and good for the money . my husband and i tested it on ourselves to see how accurate it was . we both got 5 different readings . i did n't see what the need of the plastic covers were for , since we ran out of them quickly . ( not to mention , you ca n't find replacements anywhere . ) my biggest complant was that after a month , the product completely stopped working , even after changing the batteries . i would suggest paying the extra money to get a better thermometer
baby	we 've had this toy for around 3 years now . my second child loves playing with it as much as my firstborn ! it is also a hit with other children visiting our house . the toy is as educational as it is fun ! we 've used it to practice colors , shapes , and musical creativity . it can get a little pricey as the cartridges to expand the set run ~ $ 20 new . all in all a fantastic toy well worth the price ! another upside is how friendly and helpful the neurosmith company is . we lost a block and they were friendly and helpful with the replacement . my friend finally broke down and bought this for her 2 kids because they also loved it so much
baby	i 've had this seat for some time and i saw all of the negative reviews . it took a bit to figure out the quirks , but once i did , it was fine . the seat has to go on the very front of the public toilet , not the back or in the middle like mine at home . you have to make sure that it is on securely with the lip in the front against the front of the seat . otherwise it will fold , which is probably what happened to the other reviewer . it will slid off as you come off if you 're not careful . my five year old uses it by herself and i use it with my 2 year old . it is so compact that i can stick it in my purse ( i carry in in a zippy bag ) and very easy to clean . there are n't too many of this type of product out there , but for me , it works just fine
baby	i went to the chp office to get my car seat checked , and the officer said that auto mirrors are not approved and considered a major safety hazard during an automobile crash because they can become a projectile , possibly injuring or killing your child . do not buy !
baby	while not as portable as i assumed it would be ... it 's been a great space saver over a std . highchair and great to have
baby	my baby slid both down and off the side of this . i thought it would be a good positioner because it was elevated , but instead the right bumper which is detachable does not securely fasten onto the base , rather it acted as a swivel and i found that my baby had her head hanging off the side of the positioner . i am involved in a sids research study and this product alarms me ! she could have suffocated ! i am trying to contact the company to report this item ... please do not buy
baby	we have tried 3-4 different gates at the top of our stairway over the past 3 years with our 2 young children ( now 4 yrs and a 10 month old ) . this is a great option for a gate . ours is solidly installed , it clicks shut automatically with an audible click ( so after my 4 year old goes through , i do n't have to worry about him leaving it open - it closes by itself and i can hear the `` click '' that tells me it closed ) , and you do n't have to drill holes in your woodwork/staircase to install this . it is much easier to open , just as sturdy as the drill-in gates , and looks nicer than all of the other gates we tried . we love it for our house
baby	the shelves are not sturdy and the pockets are very small ... do n't waste your money , it 's not worth it !
baby	the size of this swing is about all it has going for it and it is far from the best swing out there . i put the swing on the 5th speed and it barely moves , so much for the other 4 speeds . my daughter is starting to explore her surroundings and get into things which brings me to what i hate most about this swing . my daughter pulls herself into a straight up sitting position by holding onto the bars and stops the swing , looking like she is going to fall out . i just pray that buckle is secure ! she also likes to get her head trapped in between the legs and the swing bars to where her head is hitting the bars . so , i do n't like leaving her in the room by herself when she is in this swing . if you do n't like to get house work done or take showers , this swing might be for you
baby	my husband and i recieved this as a baby shower gift and were initially really excited about it until we started using it and realized that the motor and other mechanisms that keep the fish moving and lights going are very noisy . the noise the toy makes running is lounder than any of the music to sooth baby . we were greatly disappointed
baby	this was a great addition to the joovy caboose stand on tandem -- i can pretty much empty the essentials out of my purse , have everything discreetly on hand , and not have to lug around yet another bag . organizer is easy to slip onto the handle and does n't shift around at all . have found this product to be really helpful
baby	i unpacked this warmer which we received as a gift - did not use one with our first child . i got as far as filling the removable reservoir with water before i decided to return it . you literally fill a plastic reservoir with water and turn it upside down so that the lid to the reservoir , which slides on , has no rubber seal or other watertight implements , can leak everywhere . judging by the other comments , i 'm glad it leaked before i had a chance to use it and burn up a box of wipes .
baby	this works great with our chicco capri stroller . it took a bit of trial and error to get it in the perfect place so the stroller would close . however , once i figured that out , it was great . i could take the accessories off and just put them on when needed . the swivel is a great concept . i actually wish it came with a third clasp so baby could have a cup holder and snack holder ( one on each side ) and mommy could have her water bottle clip . we just switch them out for baby or they hold their sippy by the handles .
baby	we really like our graco digital imonitor . it gives very clear sound in a good range of volumes , and has a much longer range than any analog monitors that we tried previously . we do not get quite the range that is claimed on the box -- usually it reaches about 1/2 a city block , depending on the strength of charge left in the rechargeable batteries . the lights that light up for baby 's sound are quite bright , which can be a problem if you like to sleep in complete darkness . i turn the monitor around so that the lights do not keep me awake
baby	we have the 49mhz whisper connect and love it ( see our review of that one ) . we needed a second monitor to replace a 900mhz fisher price monitor that is 4+ years old , and decided to try this one out . we set the base across the room from our daughter and had her talk at her normal voice , and we could barely hear here with the volume turned up . we thought we must have a defective unit , so we returned it and got another , and we had the same problem . there is no interference or static with the monitor - but also no sound . we 're very unhappy with it and would not recommend it
baby	table toppers are an awesome product . we do n't leave the house without them . it gives our daughter a clean area to eat and helps the waithelp ... . there is no mess when we leave because it is contained on the table topper . we just wrap it up after her meal and toss the whole thing . the different designs also entertain our daughter while waiting for our food . other people , not only parents , ask about the table toppers and comment about them because it is such a convenient and easy to use product
baby	i picked this monitor after reading many reviews . the reviews did n't lie . this monitor does great on distance . i have a 2400 sq ft home that has 3 floors . the bedrooms are on the 3rd floor and most of my housework ended up on the 2nd floor . i can have this on while vacuuming and still hear my son cry or even move around when he would wake up and not make a sound . i could hear him grunt even ! i do n't know why the one review mentions a 15ft signal loss . you 're given many channels in order to find the right strength . i could go outside of my home and walk approximately 10 ft away from the garage door and still have signal ( he was on opposite end of house upstairs ) . i also took the receiver in the shower a couple of times , not getting it soaked . also like the voice activated portion but that only works if the room or surrounding area has no sound ( no radio or tv or mobile playing ) . great product , strongly recommend . my son is now 5 months old and the monitor still works great . this monitor is the right choice for the average household . interference may come if you 're on the same channel . i have wifi network , cordless digital phones and nextels and do not have any interference with this monitor so others just do n't know how to resolve thier issue before blaming the product
baby	finally ! a big , spacious , nice looking toy box ! ! i looked for a long time for a toy box that could set out in our family room and still blend in to the rest of the decor , but was bigger than the little wooden toy boxes that are out there ! the lid has finally improved from the old ones where the lid never stayed up . the drawers on the bottom are small , but hold a few things , and do n't take anything away from the big interior of the box . it makes the box look more sofisticated ! ! love the new colors and design . thanks little tikes !
baby	my son loves this toy , although i think the version we have is an older version as it is a different color . he is 10.5 months old and gets really excited when he sees this toy . a good buy and will keep them busy
baby	you do n't need the whole kit . only the loop and latch is needed . if you use the plastic , it gets really heavy and you end up holding it anyway . you just loop the rubber bands to the connector and then attach the tubing . this way , you can use the softfit breastshield too
baby	i just took a course from the florida highway safety program . i thought something like this would be wonderful , especially for little ones in the rear facing position . i was dead wrong . anything put in front of , on the side of , in fact , anything in the car is a real safety hazard in case of a crash . this toy , even latched down , poses a threat to the baby . he or she may just have to be bored for a while . on long trips have mom or dad or sibling in the back seat with baby for entertainment
baby	if you have an ipod or mp3 player , i 'd recommend getting this . i think the baby is going to love it ! i bought it last week , and tested it out ( our baby has n't been born yet ) . the speakers are plenty loud enough for a baby 's crib or room imo , and i 'm 1/2 deaf . i also like the little nightlight on it that changes color . my only criticism is that it takes batteries ( no ac adapter ) . we may invest in a rechargeable set of batteries if it uses batteries up quickly . for $ 20 , i think it 's great
baby	i bought this diaper pail because it used regular garbage bags and it was less expensive . well , i learned my lessen- you get what you pay for . like some other reviews the spring on my top broke which is supposed to keep the claw , if you will , closed after you put the diaper in and keep the smell in . i changed the bag often but the pail still absorbed the awful smell and after cleaning it and soaking it , it still stunk ! i am now on my second child and decided to buy the diaper genie . i hope this will work out much better
baby	works great . we tried other brands of gripe water , which did n't seem to do much . something about baby 's bliss does the trick
baby	i love the bather . i hated the old plastic ones , with this my daughter is more comfortable and does n't cry when i give her a bath . i wish i had it with my first child
baby	i was actually surprised at how good the sound quality is from this icrib sound system . it has very nice features like a 15min or 30min shutdown timer , so you can put the baby to bed with music and then the icrib will shut down after the specified time . the nightlight is also really neat , as it cycles between four different colors . the only problem with this product is that it can not run on ac , only on batteries , so we 'll be buying lots of batteries over the next couple of years , but otherwise this is a great product . edit -- after further consideration i would drop the rating to 3 stars for two reasons . first , i have found the lack of an ac power source to be very inconvenient . second , as the batteries wear down , the sound quality from the speakers deteriorates significantly
baby	years ago when the diaper genie first hit the market . i was given one as a gift for my baby shower . it did not work the way i thought it would . the genie was supposed to dispose of the diapers by sealing them so that no odor would be present . this was not the case . the smell seemed to linger in the room longer then just disposing of the diapers as normal in the trash . also the smell that the genie left after opening the genie to dispose of the long tied knots of diapers was horrible . i had to clean it several times just to get the smell out . needless to say when i had my second child and once again received one . it remained in the box and it still sits in the box after five years . i would definitely not recommend this item for new moms . too much hassle
baby	i bought this because the only way my 6 week old will sleep is in bed with me . i bought this to try to reduce the risk of sids since his has been sleeping in my bed . unfortunately , he kept moving and it was causing his legs to go off of the side of the sleeper . once his legs went off the side , his upper body would roll which would cause his face to be almost right against the side of the sleeper . of course this concerned me so each time i woke up , i had to move him again . finally , after a couple of time of doing this , i just took him out of it . this is the second sleep positioner i have bought and both have been worthless ! ! !
baby	i had one of these with my second son and loved it . we just kept it in his car seat and it made it so easy to cover him up when necessary . when it was hot out we could uncover him , and when we went into somewhere with air-conditioning we would just cover him up . it is soft and cozy . we found it so convenient . we will be purchasing another one for number three , who 's due in may .
baby	we purchased this stroller for its convenience in the car and for frequent travel . i think it 's safe to say that we have an ambivalent relationship with the volo , not including my 12 month old daughter who would give it a definite thumbs down . on the up side it is very light and folds easily and is compact . not to mention that everyone gets to see you have a maclaren stroller in a wonderful shade of orange . the stroller is great for the airport and quick shopping trips when you are in and out of the car . we first purchased the volo without springing for the seat pad . this was a mistake as our daughter was clearly uncomfortable and was unwilling to spend significant time in the stroller . the seat pad did increase her comfort level but she still grows tired of the volo much more quickly than her larger stroller . i think this has to do with the fact that she is not very upright in the volo and can not shift much in the seat as it offers no support . on top of it , the velcro on the seat pad becomes unhinged each time you fold the stroller - a minor annoyance but a hassle all the same . the awning offers very little sun protection . the mesh cargo area holds very little and is difficult to access . on top of that , you need to empty it completely in order to fold the stroller . when it comes to travel the volo leaves much to be desired . with limited cargo room , it becomes quite unstable if you hang anything on the handles . it has no recline making it difficult for children to sleep well - a problem when you want to spend the day wandering . further , while it is great to have such a lightweight stroller when getting it in and out of the car , riding escalators and getting on and off the bus , the volo flounders once you get off well-paved surfaces . we encountered potholes , dirt paths , cobblestones and sand in our tavels and the volo was a disaster . the wheels would spin erratically and catch in large divets and gutters . locking the front wheels so they would not swivel provided little relief . cobblestones were particularly disastrous as the stroller was so hard to manage and such an uncomfortable ride that we ended up carrying both the child and the volo . if i had to do it over , i would opt for a compact stroller that weighs a bit more but offers larger wheels , easy-access storage and a supported reclining seat
baby	my newborn loves this seat . the calming music and the vibation helps calm her when she is being fussy ! easy to put together and take down if you want to take it with you . great product !
baby	please spend your money on a different gate . there are nice wooden stair gates out there that seem pricey at first , but after going through what we have gone through , i wish i would have gotten a different gate . we have twin girls in a bi-level house . a stair gate is a must . the 90 day warranty is a joke , because naturally , each gate broke after 90 days . same problem with all four - the knob just wont turn . i will say - when it worked , it was nice . but read other reviews , and you will see the same problem over and over again . shame on me for buying it again . it just broke this past saturday , after six months of use . i will contact the manufacturer , but as in the past , i 'm sure i wo n't get anywhere . if enough people complain , perhaps they will change the design . again , please look elsewhere
baby	i was very disappointed in this liner . it seemed like such a great idea , but i could not get it to stick to the tub when there was any more than 2 inches of water in the bath . once the water level rose , so did the liner . we ended up returning this product to amazon
baby	my mom always said that the rectal thermometer was the best but when she used the speed one on me i found out my temperature right away and that was so cool and i like how it even does it quicker rectally than orally so i dont mind a rectal temp now and you know what ? my brothers are even doing it that way and one of them is 16 yrs old .
baby	after reading the reviews and reluctantly we bought the stroller . i am glad we did n't listen to those naysayers . it was the best decision we made because the stroller is wonderful . the comments people wrote about how the stroller is awkward and heavy is a bunch of rubbish . yes , the stroller is heavier than its predecessors but they fail to mention how sturdy it is . we 've had the stroller for 2 weeks and we hike up some hilly mountains ( stanford dish if you are from palo alto ) and it rides smoothly . it gives me comfort that the stroller is well built and protecting our two daughters ( 2 year old and 4 weeks old enfant ) . i feel secure that the stroller will not fall apart after a few rides like its predecessor . also , we love the capabilities , spring shocks for a smooth ride , shorter so we can navigate through some tight corners and it is not awkwardly long like the other double strollers . we have a toyota sienna and it fits just fine in our back trunk . as for the weight . yes , it is heavier but come on , it is not `` 10 '' times heavier . people exaggerate too much . if you are accustom to carrying your 30 pound toddler in your arms , then the stroller is nothing . people are too much of a wimp . it is slightly heavier than its predecessors but not by much . they made it heavier because the load baring bar is what keeps the stroller steady and sturdy . gives me peace of mind that my precious asset in life ( my two daughters ) are protected . the only recommendation is that the back two wheels could squeak which can be annoying . just use silicone spray and they all went away . we 've been through rain , dirt , and hot sun with this stroller and we 've been so happy with it . i highly recommend purchasing it . but make sure you have a truck , mini-van , or suv . i am not sure if a standard vehicle can house such a stroller . but i figured if you have two toddler/enfants , you may consider getting a bigger car
baby	i just bought this one for the top of the stairs and a pressure mounted gate for the bottom of the stairs . my first impressions is that a pressure mounted gate is fine for the bottom of stairs . however , gates which attach to walls with screws are way more sturdy than even the best pressure mounted alternative . we considered this model and the evenflo `` top of stair gate '' . after inspecting both gates in the store we opted for this one because the wood spindles on the evenflo seemeed less sturdy and potentially prone to breaking . if one of the spindles breaks you have to replace the entire unit . also , why take the chance with safety ? anyway , here are a few things to consider when installing this item : 1 . i took the advice of others and only used the template for the swing side hardware only . this is a must do . it would be a wall-damaging crapshoot to try to get both sides lined up exactly right using templates on both sides of the wall . 2 . unless you are screwing the hardward into a banister and do n't want to damage them by having screws go all the way through , use longer screws than the dinky 1/4 '' to 1/2 '' screws that are provided in the kit . i went with 2 '' screws for additional strength . 3 ) installation is n't that big of a deal . just take your time to avoid silly mistakes that result in extra holes in your walls . i found the picture-based instructions at the back of the booklet far more useful than the word-based instructions at the front of the booklet . it was n't a five minute job but it was not hard at all . i 'll be back in a few months to post my thoughts on the gate after it has had some wear and tear from our 11 months old son and our 100lb dog .
baby	finally ! ! ! i am a stickler for matching things , with my other kids i used the urban bundle me and the original bundler but i love having the matching hat for my december baby , i know she 's warm .
baby	this is my favorite sheet for our daughter 's crib . it is a soft knit material and it washes up so well . it fits easily onto the matress and i have never had a problem with it coming loose . it is also such an adorable print
baby	just received this set and my wife and i love it ! the construction is very solid but not too bulky for us . the micro-fabric seems to be in high quality and goes along nicely with our furniture . the only two complains are : 1 ) the handle 's height is not adjustable , which seems a bit too high to us ( i am 5'6 '' btw ) ; and 2 ) it would be great to have a hand-break ( i.e . wheel lock button on the handle ) -- we previously thought the red button on the handle is a wheel lock but it is not ; it is the collapse/expand button instead . despite these imperfection , we feel it much worth the $ 195 we paid for
baby	i like this humidifier alot but now i can not find replacement filters for it . i only had it for about 3 months and now i can not find replacement filters . this unit was not cheap either , it did cost money and now for it to basically be brand new and not to be able to find filters is really fustrating . i would not recommend this humidifier for this reason only
baby	i like the music , but we have to have it on auto to play . because i have a mirror in the seat to see my son ( he is still backward facing ) , i ca n't move the seal up farther so that he can reach the part to kick and make the item turn on . also , i have never been able to create bubbles like the instructions claim . so just music plays . there are plenty of other smaller items that can do that . this thing also eats up batteries like you would n't believe . i am changing them every couple of days , and we are n't in the car much . what a disappointment ! ! good concept , but does n't work well at all
baby	i just bought this seat for my 9 month old son . i bought it for the convenience of the fold down front . as good as that feature is it still causes red marks on my sons knees . he is a thin baby so i do n't know how well this would work for a chubbier baby . also , the seat it self is slippery . i have to place a rag down before i put the baby in because he will slide forward if i do n't . this is very uncomfortable for him.unfortunately , this seems to be the only seat with the fold down front which does make taking the baby in and out easier . that is really the only good thing i can say about this product .
baby	this product is great but do not buy it from bp medical . you can not return an unopened and unused product for a full refund - they charge a 15 % restocking fee that is not disclosed at the time of purchase
baby	i am a mother of 6 and this works . you can put a few baby neccessities in it . i use it for a few diapers , baby wipes , desitin , and the bulb syringe . i can move it around and it does not take much space
baby	this timer system is beyond helpful - it becomes your brain when you have a newborn , as the hours , feedings and diaper changes become a total blur during this amazing yet totally sleep deprived time of your life . while it would be nice to have a few more features like total ounces drank , whether the diaper was a wet one or a doodie , and tracking of daily totals for everything - that 'd be more of a infantcare pda , and is a bit beyond the scope of this little device . all it aims to be is a timer that will keep track of the key stats in your baby 's life , consequently making your life way easier . i wake up in middle of the night and the baby is grunting , for example . i click the backlight button and see that in fact the baby has only been asleep for an hour , and had a diaper and bottle right before that . then i just go back to sleep . on the other hand , he beguns grunting and making noises and i see the itzbeen says it 's been 2 hours 30 minutes since his last bottle or diaper , and i know it 's time to get up and feed him . it 's also great for team caregiving , as my husband can hand me the itzbeen after doing his morning shift , and i automatically know when the last change and bottle were . we use the wildcard button to track bottle expirations too . thumbs up for the developers of this cool gadget - i hope to see an `` itzbeen ii '' w/ some advanced features in time for my next baby - although keeping it simple does help keep it easy and quick to use , especially in the fog of a 1am , 3am , and 5am feeding schedule ! ( my son never got the memo that full term babies are only supposed to eat every 3 or 4 hours :
baby	i have bought this set for a gift , but also received it as a gift myself ( from my registry ) . although my daughter is two and a half now , i would recommend the playtex nursers to everyone ! they are sanitary and do cause less gas than conventional bottles . i definitely like the drop-ins liners better than the traditional ones ... from a convenience standpoint , paired with the fact that they work so well with the breast milk storage system . i 'm not planning on any more children , but i do n't dare part with these bottles yet . they are stored in my basement for future use , either my myself or family members . they also helped make the transition from breast to bottle to sippy cup a breeze
baby	i went through an entire box in two days ! the fill with milk in no time and have to be changed constantly . plus , the diameter of these are much smaller than any others . try gerber or lansinoh
baby	i got this pump as a hand-me-down from my friend . it worked great even after many years ... i eventually purchased the pump in style advanced limited edition where the pump can be separated from the bag . it takes up less desk space ( no extra space required for the bag ) . also , it 's more portable if all you need is the pump . i pump all over the house ( study , bedroom , living room while watching tv with my husband ) . just a note to some people having problems getting milk out with the medelas ... it may not be the pump itself but the size of the flanges . every woman 's breast and nipples are different sizes . initially , i was using the standard 24mm flanges ( suction cup things that go over your breasts ) . it was painful to pump and my milk would not come out even though i was engorged with plenty of milk . it would take me 2 hours just to get 2 oz of milk ! i went to see a lactation consultant who suggested i try the next size up flanges ( 27mm ) . she got me one to try and it made a world of difference . i could immediately pump 2oz in under 5 mins . now , i pump daily to stock up and can get 4 oz from both breasts in under 10 mins ( estimate since i do n't really time it cause it 's so fast ) . i am now planning to pump to donate my milk to a milk bank . this pump made a world of difference . i think medela makes flanges in 3 different sizes . the standard 24mm that comes with all their pumps , the 27mm and a 30mm .
baby	i bought this play gym because i figured it was a baby einstein play gym it has to be good ... plus the reviews i read were good . our local babiesr'us did n't have displays of the playgyms so i had no idea that this gym would suck . i hate it ! ! my son only loves it cause i put other toys on there . notice the pictures that people have shared who state they love this play gym and so does their babies that the toys hanging on the playgyms are n't the ones that originally came with the gym . why buy extra toys ? ? i paid $ 69 for this gym ... it should come with more toys . i tried to return this for the gym by tiny love that comes with lights , music and lots of toys but when i opened the product the original packaging got messed up and i was unable to return or exchange . what a waste of money for me . i received another playgym that my friend bought for $ 20 from my baby shower . that only came with 3 toys and hung all these toys on there and my son loves that too . my point is that you do n't have to spend so much money on a playgym . your babies will love anything as long as there is lots to look at or if you are going to spend money find one with lots of toys so that you dont 'have to buy extra toys .
baby	product is not worth the money . made the bassinet very unstable
baby	in order for a cordless monitor to have any privacy , you need it to be digital and use digital-spread-spectrum ( dss ) technology . 900 mhz is the best frequency for a baby monitor , though . here 's why : it is important for people to know that if you have a wireless network in your house , that it can not share the same frequencies at any other 2.4 ghz devices . this includes baby monitors and cordless telephones . the correct arrangement should be : baby monitor : 900 mhz digital-spread-spectrum ( dss ) wifi netowrk : 2.4 ghz cordless telephone : 5.8 ghz digital-spread-spectrum ( dss
baby	we bought this when our baby was born ( 6 months ago , only used it a few times until recently ) . he loves it now to get him to sleep . the problem lies in that at 4 am , my husband and i awake to hear the mobile playing ... scares us to death since no one else should be around to start it . we go into the nursery and our child is holding it playing with the animals ... .the clip that holds the umbrella part had broken off , causing the mobile to fall on the baby . ( he thought it was the funniest thing in the world , he was okay , thank god . ) but the little plastic hook piece was in his hand . if you have a 6-month old child you know that they eat everything they can find . i thank god that he didnt put that in his mouth . it is a great soother for the baby , but be sure there are no defects every day ! like i said before , other than this , it has been great .
baby	we had the fisher proce sound and lights monitor and decided to go digital . this was the one we picked in our price range . we had it for a few weeks and absolutely loved it ... until there was some weather changes . every time the weather was not clear the monitor could not find a signal and made a terrible beeping sound ! buy the sound a lights for $ 15 and save the extra money ! !
baby	i am impressed with this seat ! this seat is far better made than the seat that was on my toilet . the training booklet that came with the seat has stickers on 4 different themes : pottyprincess , pottypirate , pottypony and pottysaurus . i called the free line ( 87-pottypal ) and was able to buy the stool ( a little cheaper than amazon 's set ) and 4 dolls to accompany the stickers as rewards . i am completely satisfied with the safety and sanitation of this product .
baby	my son is 5 months old now and for the first 4 months , the monitor worked pretty well . we got a bit of static from time to time , but i would have given it 4 stars . but ... one night i woke up to reassure myself with the little green `` on '' light and saw that the monitor was not on . thinking it was a fluke , i turned it back on , checked the baby and went to bed . but , over the course of a couple of weeks , it became more and more unreliable , turning off at will . it was also hard to turn it back on . i had to flip the switch several times before it would work . and , this is not a battery issue , since it was plugged in the entire time . i went to the evenflo website and read the faqs . there 's a mention of a problem with the power light going out , but nothing about the monitor itself going out . needless to say , we 've thrown it away and have gotten a different brand . i mentioned this to my friend with an 8 month old the other day and she said the same exact thing happened to hers - just stopped working reliably . she 's bought a different monitor too . both of our new monitors are working perfectly now with less static . i would n't recommend purchasing this monitor until they make some changes .
baby	i doubt i could have made it through the first three months without this product . my daughter had undiagnosed acid reflux and this was recommended as a help . ( after she was diagnosed , we were given zantac ... but still used this as well ! ) it 's a true godsend . we 'd add a dropperful to her formula and presto - she was content ! ! ! this works far better than mylicon . it is expensive - but it is completely worth the price . we called it 'liquid gold ' in our house
baby	it 's not just the most icredible piece of junk i ever seen , it is the most dangerous piece of junk i ever seen on the market for kids . the plastic is very thin , very weak and bends every each way . my daughter weighs 35 pounds and the step almost collapsed under her weight . is slides off the toilet bowl and the seat itself also bends down under the child 's weight , which really frightened my girl . there 's no way a child should use it without an adult actually lifting it and putting it on the seat . i feel soooo stupid to have bought it ( (
baby	i bought this to puree my 6 month old daughter 's homemade baby foods . you put the blade at the bottom of the cup , load the food in , then put a protective plate and finally put the top piece ( which contains the motor ) on top . the concept seemed good and it is a compact size . cons : 1 ) the cup holds less than 1 cup of food ... if you go over that amount , any liquids in the food start to splatter through and make a mess , and sometimes causes the motor to stop running ... guess it shorts it out and i have to wait until it dries out before i can start again . if you 're trying to make enough to freez cubes of food , you 'll have to puree several batches . 2 ) you can only run the motor for short periods of time ... up to 20 seconds max or something like that for some foods . this is fine for soft foods , but if trying to puree meats , for example , it sometimes takes longer than that and it becomes a hassle having to grind , wait , grind , wait ... .3 ) the motor that powers the blade is way too slow , cooked chicken or beef ends up being too lumpy , since you really need a faster blade to puree them . i 've found that the for pureering baby foods , the best thing to use is a blender , since the blade speed is much faster and the design helps to draw foods down to the bottom so things can get more evenly pureed . do n't waste your money on buying this
baby	we like this stroller . it seems to be pretty durable , and its weight and portability ( shoulder strap ) make it ideal for trips , especially in airports . my husband has a hard time pushing it sometimes because he is so tall ( 6'4 '' ) , but it is fine for me ( 5'3 '' ) . we like it for our 5-month-old son because he is able to recline , but still sit up enough to watch what 's going on . he can hold his head up well but is n't sitting up unsupported yet , so the various levels of the reclining back are nice . overall , a good stroller for the price
baby	after reading some of the reviews i felt compelled to share my experience with this product . i love it ! i 'm not sure if they made a different model before , but mine has an on/off switch that works just fine ( its on the back ) . its not rocket science if you follow the directions . i never have problems with the bottle floating . if you put the bottle in first and then fill the warmer with water like the directions tell you to , then the bottle wo n't float . the warmer itself has a chart on it that tells you how long to leave the bottle in the warmer and at what setting . it also has a light that flashes on and off when the warmer has reached a constant temperature . there are no `` dings '' or timers , but that has n't presented any problems for me . overall this product does what it is supposed to do and it does it well . as a first time mom , i highly recommend it .
baby	the biggest disappointment was that after 6 months , the tub began leaking air through an unseen hole- maybe in the seams ( thus patch would not work ) . kel-gar does not warranty the product , and the store that the tub came from ( via amazon ) only offered a 90 day warranty . also , the tub is too wide to fit in a standard tub- only half the water from the tub spout lands in tub , the rest flows behind it . thus wasted water and it takes longer to fill
baby	used this for double stroller while on vacation in hershey park -fantastic ! easy to put on - easy to store ! i do n't know why strollers - especially doubles - have such dinky canopies anyway ! but this did it 's duty
baby	lightweight , high-quality construction . we are very pleased with it , and our 1.5yr girl just loves it . the carrying strap is a very convenient addition . do n't waste your money on a $ 20 umbrella stroller , spend a little more and enjoy the high quality of this excellent stroller
baby	heats milk and food esecially when frozen . i use a clean baby food jar to heat frozen baby food i 've made
baby	i bought the dual room imonitor yesterday . ( only available in store at babies r us ) . it is the same as the one shown here , but it has two transmitters to montor two children . based on only 4 hours of testing , i am taking the unit back . pro : -the range was great . whole house , plus 800ft outside . -no interference . i live in a dense suburban area with many sources of interference . -easy to setup . -shape/size of parent units are much better than others ( especially sony ) cons : -controls are not very straightforward . -the unit always hisses . it is not sound/voice activated . -the power switch on the parent unit is a button that is not recessed . when you turn it off , it does not beep or let you know that you did . the button is easy to bump , and would make it easy to carry the thing while it is off , and you think it is on . -the deal breaker : a power outage requires turns off child units . with even a short power interruption , the child units come up in the `` off '' mode . you have to go to the baby 's room and turn them on . until you do , the parent unit will beep and flash red . we have been using the sony 910 for 3 years with our first child . i guess it has spoiled us
baby	after using a smaller plastic tub and a blow up tub , this one is the best ! i only wish i would 've just bought this one to begin with . my little guy is 6 months old , 24 pounds but ca n't sit up yet . he still uses the side that lays him down in the water , and he loves it ! do n't waste your money on other tubs , this one is the best . this one will grow with your child while saving water too
baby	i bought these bottles thinking that since my daughter likes her soothie pacifier , then this would be a good transition bottle from breast to bottle . wrong ! ! ! she hated these bottles . i would put the pacifier in her mouth and then try to get her to take the bottle and she would scream bloody murder . i gave these bottles one star because i think it is a good concept but unfortunately did n't work for us . the only bottle she would take was the playtex bottles with the big nipples that she could grasp good with her mouth
baby	i agree with several others about it being very difficult to clean . there are so many nooks and crannies . i used it for my daughter and hated it and then tried it again when i had my son and it was no different . my son is 16 months old and has been learning to feed himself and there are times that i do not want to let him practice because i dread how long it takes me to clean after each meal . i went out and bought an inexpensive highchair without all of the bells and whistles and it works great ! now i have more time to spend playing with him instead of cleaning a highchair .
baby	the whole purpose is to store toys up off the floor of the tub , but that is impossible since it wo n't stick to tile above the tub . i had n't even put any toys in it , and it would n't stick . i returned it and found something on `` one step ahead '' .
baby	this monitor is awful . i have had it for 5 months and it has only worked properly for 1 . it makes loud beeping noises at the oddest times , like 2 am ! ! ! do not buy this monitor . the onlt thing it has going is it is nice looking ! ! !
baby	this gate only worked for 8 months and the latch broke ! the company would not replace it because they only offer a 90 day warranty . they will not even let you buy a replacement part . they want you to buy a entire new gate . what a rip off ! do n't buy this gate , it is a piece of trash
baby	i think the idea behind the sling is great but it is not for every baby . everytime our son is put in this he crys or screams . he is an easy going fellow but he has n't liked being held to closely . he wants his freedom and this does n't give much freedom to a newborn . also , the `` training '' video is more of a promotional advertisement . i had to go to the web site to get more information about how to use it
baby	i purchased these monitors thinking i would n't need to use them at all since the baby 's room is right next door . i 'm glad i did buy them because my son ended up with acid reflux and spit up in his sleep constantly for awhile there , so being able to hear him and go to him is a comfort . anyways , there are only 2 channels on these monitors , which is a bummer since i live in a big apartment complex . i get interference of all kinds from telephone conversations to other people 's babies crying , which really weirded me out the first time i heard it . i tried using a battery with it when i brought it with me to check the mail ( yes the door was locked , no i am not a bad mother ) and was only able to hear static . i wish i had bought a monitor with more channels . note to self : keep reciepts and packaging from now on ! !
baby	we got this before our little one was born . she was born a little premature and only 4 lbs . we used it in her bedside bassinet , and later in her crib . although we had a few false alarms once she started moving around the crib , they were worth it for the peace of mind all the other hours . baby girl is now two and we continue to use it . she 's in a toddler bed now , and we can tell if she gets out of bed when she 's not supposed to ! this is a great device and everyone should have one . comparible in price to other nursery monitors , you get so much more . it also has clear sound and little interference in our house
baby	this did not work for us at all . i found that i could n't get it wrapped around our newborn without her kicking it off . if you know how to swaddle then use the hospital blanket or another thin blanket made of cotton
baby	i got this swing and i will be talking it back . i put it on 5 and it will not move . i do n't know what it would be like with the baby in it . i just tryed it .
baby	a friend of mine introduced me to the babyplus system . i am just now beginning my third trimester and have been using the babyplus since week 20 . i enjoy the 2 hours a day i use the system . i feel like i am 'doing a good thing ' for my little boy on the way . while using babyplus , the battery cover clips snapped off . i emailed customer service and they happily offered to replace the cover , no questions asked . babyplus is a company that seems more concerned with a positive experience for the baby , rather than making sure i had all the required paperwork for replacement parts
baby	i bought this hoping it would help me organise all my baby diapering needs . unless you have a changing station ( or crib , wherever you want to hang it ) that has slits or slots able to hold it - the velcro will not hold it well . and the `` shelves '' are a bit insecure . it 's a great idea , but just did n't pan out .
baby	i have this seat for my 4 month old and i love it ... yes it is larger than your average infant car seat but i have no problems getting it in and out of my car which is a toyota avalon not the smallest car on the market but certainly not the biggest ... with my daughter who is 5 when she moved to the convertible car seat the biggest downfall was having to wake her up to get out of the car ... graco has made it so that i no longer have to do this . my son is nearly 20lbs already and had i been using your average infant seat i would have to buy him a new one already ... bravo to graco for making a seat with extra weight/height limits ... another perk is it has the canopy so the sun is n't in his eyes which i also would n't get if he were in a convertible car seat . my one and only complaint is that the fabric is n't breathable so my son sweats a lot in this seat but i just put a receiving blanket between him and the seat and he is fine ... this in itself is n't enough to make me trade this seat for another
baby	we live in the cold , rainy northwest part of the country . this product has been essential since our little boy was born in december . it has been in his carseat since the day we took him home from the hospital . we never need to use blankets or bundle him up in heavy clothes when we take him out in the carseat . he stays warm and protected in the bundle me . this is definitely the best and most used product we have bought for our baby . it is a must for winter babies . it is well worth the money
baby	i bought this carrier for a recent trip my family took and i am so glad i had it ! i used it for my 8 month old to carry her around instead of using a stroller . there are many pockets which have plenty of room to store all your needed items and the stand works well to set down on the ground when not wearing it . my daughter seemed to be quite comfortable in it and at one point even fell asleep . she loved being able to see everything around her at our level . i am 5'3 '' and my husband is 6'1 '' and we both wore it comfortably . i would recommend this item to anyone needing something smaller than a stroller
baby	we received this item as a xmas gift last year and within 4 months the legs have broken . my two year old twin boys loved playing at the table but sadly the durability of this product was very poor . the legs were very unstable upon receipt of the item . we were extremely dissapointed which is unusual being that it was a step 2 product .
baby	we have the graco ultra clear monitor and it has worked really well for us for over 3 years . with a new baby on the way , we thought we 'd upgrade to the new technology . oops . it turns out that the range on the new monitor was about half that of the ultra clear ( could n't even make it to the other side of the house ) , and the reception was quite poor . and the annoying beeping was the clincher . i sent it back today and bought another $ 40 ultra clear . oh , and i tried the fisher price private connection also , and had the same issues..
baby	seeing a 1 year old little girl playing these instruments is hysterical ! my niece absolutely loved them . she had such an easy time handling them because they are her size , which is unusual . all other instrument toys are so much larger and it 's hard for them to hold on to them while trying to play them ! the smiles and giggles are worth everything
baby	i loved the gate . so when i moved to my new house and found that the doorways were wider than the gate , i needed the extension . it was well worth it . my daughter is always pulling on it and hanging on it , and it still stays very sturdy within the doorway . i am also happy that we got to re-use the hands free gate because i would have hated to fasten a gate right onto the wall and make holes in my wall . this gate was a great purchase
baby	i received this seat as a gift for my baby shower , i thought it was going to be a great seat , graco has been on the market for several years , and it 's built up a reputation . but was i wrong ! everytime that i would go out with my newborn , and i would make a turn , the seat would flip over to the side , it did not matter how slow i made the turn it would always do the same thing . i 'm a very carefull driver , specially after i gave birth to my son . you ca n't imagine how horrible it is , to look throuhg the rearview mirror , and see that your tiny little precious bundle of joy , has flipped over and his head is hanging . i would have to look for a place to park , and have to fix him and the seat . i had to move both the passenger and the driver seat as far back as possible , in order to hold the baby seat with the backrest , just so that it would n't tip over , and it made it a little difficult to drive . you might say , she probably did n't install it well , but you would be wrong , it was perfectly installed , i had someone check the installation in my city , and everything was fine . the base of the seat is not completely flat , making it difficult for the seat to stay in place . this did not just happen to me , it also happened to my sister with her baby 's seat , we had our children with a few weeks difference . i had to get a different seat , i purchased one with a flatter base , and that one worked perfectly . i will never buy another graco seat again , i believe it 's worth spending more money on a better seat , i believe ones children are priceless , and investing money in their safety
baby	okay , maybe i should have read the laundering instructions , which say to machine wash and then `` drip dry '' - but who makes baby items that ca n't be machine dried ? how many parents have the time to line-dry delicates ? the upshot is that this fell apart - melted in the dryer and got fluff all over everywhere - the first time we ever washed it . if you need something you can throw in the washer/dryer when it gets dirty and not worry about sorting , this is not your product . grrr
baby	my son used this several times wet all over the floor each time . there is no splash guard on it for boys , but it probably works fine for girls
baby	my wife and i like the portable crib quite a bit . it is great to move from room to room and you can pull it up next to your bed similar to a co-sleeper . the price is also not bad at all . the only annoying thing is that the mattress pad that comes with it is so flimsy as to be practically unusable . ( we went to baby depot and bought a serviceable pad for about $ 20 . ) even after buying the extra mattress pad i still think the portable crib was a good buy and i do not regret our decision to buy the crib at all . ( i would buy the crib again if i had to start all over -- our son sleeps quite well in it .
baby	i agree with the above reviewers . this rug is large and very well made . perfect in any little girl 's room
baby	this seat , along with the matching step stool are great ! my daughter loves having her very own , special toilet seat and step for going potty . it has encouraged her to potty train , it fits the toilet seat nicely , and is easy for her to put on the toilet by herself . i put a suction hanger on the toilet tank and is easily put out of the way when mommy and daddy need to go potty , and she can easily get it and set it up for herself as well .
baby	after i had my 2nd son , we bought a graco double stoller , but it was so long , heavy and cumbersome that i only used it a few times before we decided to get rid of it . we bought this tandem stroller a few months ago and i love it ! great stoller , lightweight , easy to manuvuer and my 4 year old loves to ride in it b/c he can either sit or stand in the back . it 's much smaller when folded up than most of the other double strollers on the market too . i wish that i had known earlier that it also has an infant carseat attachment . i highly recommend this stoller , but do wish that the parent tray/cup holder came standard with the stoller
baby	i bought this just before my third trimester when the back pain from lifting a 30 lb two-year-old all day long became absolutely unbearable . it was n't quite what i was expecting , and came nowhere near giving me the support in my back and belly that i was looking for . it helped a teeny tiny bit , but the construction is such that it just ca n't provide much support ( it 's a little heavier-weight than a bra , with no additional elastic ) . i bought the other one , by loving comfort , and was thrilled . it 's a little bit more intimidating , perhaps , and less , uh , sexy , but it really works in all the ways that this one did n't . it slings my belly up nicely and takes over the work for my pained muscles . ahhhhh
baby	i love this pillow . i 've had it for about two and a half months now . at first it helped me stay on my side , and was just comfy to snuggle up to . now that my belly is getting bigger , it gives great support and does n't let my belly `` hang '' down . this is great for people who do n't always sleep on their sides as once you position it you are unlikely to roll over in your sleep . i 've had no problem with the stuffing . if you are looking for super firm support , try a wedge . this is a pillow , and feels as such . of course , if you are on a budget , you can always just use a regular pillow , but if you want to pamper yourself the unique shape of this pillow makes it extra comfortable . **update** i 'm now 8 months pregnant and love my pillow ! mine came covered in a zippered cover , so that is what i wash. every few nights , i just grab the larger part and shake it hard until the stuffing falls down , then fluff it and it is as good as new . i also like that , yes , it does take up some room , but no where near as much room as many pregnancy pillows . all in all , whether you like this pillow or not will come down to personal choice
baby	if you are gon na breastfeed buy the a boppy pillow ! ! ! they are awesome and easy . you can wash them , they have covers for them and they come in handy when you want to put the baby somewhere . love it ! ! ! +++
baby	these extensions should have been included with the co-sleeper . as it is , the co-sleeper is lower than the average adult bed and the extensions are required if you want your child sleeping on your level . the fact that they sell it as a separate item is pure gouging for an extra few bucks , which is irritating . they are simple pieces of plastic and should n't add but a dollar or two to arms reach 's cost . there are twelve pieces , so you can use a max of 3 pieces per leg to increase it to the maximum height . we had to do just that , and found that the three connected pieces are *very* unstable . it 's too bad they charge so much for a poorly constructed set of unstable plastic pieces . what they should do is provide a set of pieces of varying heights , to prevent too many connections to a bed that 's holding your precious child
baby	my twins loved this one so much ... we purchased all styles available at the time
baby	i 've had the hippo faucet cover for over six months and i think it 's great ! my son is always sitting near the faucet and this definitely prevents him from getting hurt . it is a little bit of a pain to take off if you need to use the shower but otherwise i think it 's worth it ! the only problem i found with the hippo cover is that it does n't really dispense bubble bath well .
baby	i would recommend just buying one that sits on top of the toilet and a stepping stool . you do n't have to clean # 2 out of the cup and you 'll probably already have a stepping stool so that your child can reach the sink . it really saves a lot of hastle my mother-in-law and i both bought this potty for my daughter . ( one for her house and one for mine . ) it was hard for me to put together , my mo-in-law could n't get it together at all . it makes a loud trumpet sound every time `` water '' passes a sensor inside the toilet that scared my daughter terribly at first , but luckily it took a lot of batteries to work and it died . the other thing i 'd like to point out is if your child actually likes the noise and the batteries die , they are almost impossible to replace . in order to replace them you have to take almost the whole toilet apart , which again is very hard to put back together . we got ours on sale so i do n't mind the expenditure . when you are buying these things just remember it is only a toilet that they will be using for a year or so tops ...
baby	after checking out all of the boppys , i decided to get the bare naked one and purchase slipcovers . i have received so many compliments on the pink slipcover -- even the nurses at the hospital loved it ! it is so soft , and i have washed it a few times with no problems ( i have n't put it in the dryer , though ) . it does not protect the boppy itself from spit-up , etc. , of course , since it is not a waterproof cover . however , i was not expecting it to be waterproof , and the regular boppys without slipcovers are not waterproof , so it 's not a big deal to me . since i have the plain white boppy , nothing shows through , but this might be an issue for decorated boppys
baby	in my months of 'experimentation ' and a few purchases in err , this is the best product of its sort out there . it 's the only product i 've purchased ( or tried out in the store ) that truly requires only one hand ! with my 8 month old on my shoulder , i drop this bag into the cart seat , i unzip it flip the 'diaper pocket ' over the back , pull the generous , elastic edged cover up and over the cart handle and that 's just about it . additionally , the buggy bag is among the few that covers the whole cart , and ( uniquely ) adds further protection from germs with 2 separate belts : one to go around your child 's waist , the other to secure it to the cart . not to be forgotten : the buggy bag comfortable ( apparently ! ) , has simple convenient storage options and stores itself w/ ease ! on the other hand , i tried one imitation in a popular baby store and not only did it not open with one hand ( a necessity with a baby on your hip in a grocery store parking lot ! ) but i could not get it back into its 'carrying ' shape with two hands ! ! i hid it on the shelf and moved away quickly . eek . another product i purchased online came in two pieces and had so many clips and belts wrapping it together , that i could barely attach it with both hands and help from passersby . while it had 'shoulder straps unlike any other , they dont work in most carts that put an advertising placard on the back of the cart seat . finally adjusted , that product ( the `` shop'n'dine '' ) didnt cover most of the cart . ( on its debut shopping trip ) i threw it back in the car and went home , too tired to shop . finally , there are lots of imitators out there , dont be suckered in by similar names , better price points or preferred fabric choices : the buggy bag will preserve your sanity and , perhaps , your child 's health .
baby	this seat is a great concept , it just does n't stay together very well . i took it back to the store and they marked it as `` defective '' . for a few dollars more , i got the `` healthy care booster seat '' from fisher price . i 've had much better luck with it
baby	i love this sling ! but i 'd like to stress as other people have done that you have to practice with it to find what works for you . it may be too big for your newborn . i started using it when my son was 4 weeks , but he was a large baby . i 've found the key is wear it high ! the instructions say the you and your baby will be more comfortable with baby at chest height . it 's true ! if you try to wear it with the baby hanging a little lower near your stomach it 's going to hurt your back and shoulder and wear you out and he/she 's going to squirm and be uncomfortable . i used it every day of my sons 3rd month when we were in hotels between moving . now i used it every time i grocery shop because as soon as he 's in it he falls asleep , no matter the time of day . if i try to push him through the whole store sitting in the cart in his carseat he 'll start screaming but if i put him in my sling i wo n't hear a peep out of him the whole trip . and you have to admit it 's so cute and stylish ! several people have stopped to ask me where i got it and i love directing them to amazon !
baby	i bought this swing because our first baby had colic reflux and i heard someone else say that the side-to-side swinging action really calmed their babies colic . i thought this baby might be too so we bought this swing . no colic this time , but she already loves to watch the birds and butterflies turn around the top . she follows them around with her eyes . very stimulating for the young ones
baby	i loved this item at face value - it looks good , the materials are good quality , it feels secure , and the premise of the functionality of the bed was what i wanted because i planned on breastfeeding my newborn and wanted her close by . i was proud of my purchase and showed it to many of my friends before the baby came . well , the `` mattress '' that comes with it is so hard that my baby wo n't sleep in it . she wo n't nap in it , and when i put her down all she does is cry . i 've tried everything to get her to sleep in this thing because it would be so helpful if she would , but she wo n't sleep in it at all . i 've even tried making it softer by putting blankets down on the board of a mattress and covering this with a receiving blanket that i tuck in the sides ( something i do n't want to do because of the sids factor ) and that does n't even help - it 's still too hard of a surface . now , my baby is sleeping in bed with me and i ca n't get any sleep because i 'm afraid of rolling over on her or her rolling off of the bed . if they 'd just make the mattress more comfortable for the baby , this would be a perfect product and i 'd rate it a 5 , but because it 's virtally useless to me and my baby due to the mattress/board , i have to rate it only 2 stars . i 'm so let down by this product
baby	this protects our leather seats well but is much wider than the infant carrier base which crowds the other passengers sitting next to the baby . otherwise a good product .
baby	i ordered this stroller to take my 16 month old daughter to florida on vacation ... it is absolutely perfect ... folds small , has room for storage , you can even carry a small diaper bag under the seat on the cross bars ... it really is perfect for travel ... actually , it is perfect for anytime .
baby	i am unhappy with this product . my newborn baby is 22 '' long and weighs 7 pounds . i purchased this item after speaking to the rep about size . i 've found that my son can easily get his legs out of the bottom pouch through the opening . i think that if there was a longer strip of velcro instead of the short square , this would be prevented . he also can get his arms out of the top . if the velcro strip could be larger , going more toward the back and side of the product , this would not happen . maybe my son is more narrow at the top than some children and this is not a problem for many , but i think this would make the product more useable , one size fits all . also , he is long , and the small size was too cramped . i 'm assuming the next size up would have been too wide for him and therefore making it impossible for his arms to stay inside - which is happening anyway . i like the product idea and the fabric and construction , ( which is why i gave it 2 stars ) but this product did not work for me . i have recently purchased the first years swaddle blanket , but have issues with that one as well . i am currently searching for one to fit .
baby	i have tried these for the first time with my fourth child . i wish i would have used this system for all my children . i have used all kinds of bottles from the old glass bottles to vent-air to avent ... many types with my first 3 children . i decided to give these a try considering i was tired of scrubbing bottles . my little girl switched to these very easily from the breast , it helped tremendously with her colic by cutting down on gas ( switching from regular formula to soy helped to , plus i had to start avoiding all milk products while breastfeeding ) plus they are so easy to clean and manage . i have had no leak problems like i did with avent ... vent-air # 1 nipple would collapse plus my son would have projectile spit-up after feedings when i tried to switch him to the # 2 nipples ( awful system ) ... absolutely no problems with the original playtex bottles . my only minor complaint is trying to fit my fingers in the bottle to collapse the liner to rid of air ... very hard if you do not have tiny hands . we bought the easy-feed bottles with the lift in the bottom to aid in releasing air ... alittle easier . store brand liners work just as well as brand name liners ... i have seen no difference except in price . target brand is very good . i would recommend these bottles to everyone
baby	i placed this order on july 25th , amazon 's estimated delivery date is aug 18th-25th . i contacted babyage , and my order wont be sent until the 6th of sept . very disappointed
baby	my boys love them . they draw in the car and their cup can sit on it . kinda a pain for short drives , but wonderful for longer trips .
baby	this worked great for a couple months . then the monkey that moves up and down started making a loud clicking noise . the gears must be slipping . my poor baby gets really excited to kick the parrot to make the monkey move , then gets scared at the loud clicking/popping noise and starts crying . really sad
baby	my 1 1/2 year old son really enjoys this toy . he loves putting the little men on top . he does n't play with the toys on the side , guess thats for younger kids , but he does enjoy the shape sorter and the drawbridge opening is cute and holds his attention . i find an advantage over the classic fisher price is that he ca n't as easily just rip the cover off and toss the pieces in when he gets frustrated . at this age , i find the alphabet pieces a waste and wish there were more shapes to sort . perhaps when he 's older he 'll enjoy the letters as well , but i doubt he 'll still be interested . overall , cute toy that holds his attention while many do not . main drawback is that there are only 4 shapes to sort
baby	i registered for these bottles i am a new mom and thought the variety was great . we used the stage one nipple and my son was able to suck down his formula with no problem infact way to quick . he would struggle with feeding time . he was so gassy and had horrible reflux , that during feeding he would arch his back stffin his body and cry . i did have a recommendation to switch to the dr. brown bottles which made a huge diffrence . however , he was still spiting up and still a little gassy just not as bad and it was managable , their stage 1 nipples were to small and the stage two were to big . we had gone on a camping trip and i bought the playtex disposable bottles for easier cleaning . i also had done some research on these bottles and found several people liked them better then the dr. brown . so i tried them and my son is doing much better he dose n't even spit up anymore . so if you like the ventair i think you would like the disposable much better . my sons dr. wanted to put him on an antacid but i was not comfortable with giving him medication at such a young age i wanted to see if i could solve the problem , which i have done completly with the playtex disposable bottles !
baby	i am so disgusted that i woke at 5am on black friday to drive 12 miles to walmart to purchase a dora toddler bed . i held the dora toddler bed until christmas , when on christmas eve i went to put it together and the pieces were package wrong and i was unable to assemble the bed at all . i ended up returning the bed , in exchange fr nothing . i found out that they no longer carry the bed .
baby	well , they say that you get what you pay for . that would be true if you can find this on sale for $ 50 of less ! if you are used to particle board furniture , this will suit you fine . if you have higher standards , spend more and avoid this . some of the pieces cracked as screws went into the pre-drilled holes in the particle board . several pieces arrived damaged . we had to request 3 replacement parts from the manufacturer and are still not happy with it , but now it is assembled and impossible to ship back so we are stuck with it . if you do buy this and get it assembled , try not to move it around too much , as it may fall apart . also , the drawers are very shallow . do n't expect to store much in this . it did arrive promptly , but the shipper and target would have done me a favor if they had lost it instead of delivering it
baby	this is a great pack'n'play . it 's easy to set-up and take any place . the bassinet is great - very sturdy and larger than another one that i have . the colors are bright and the music piece keeps our baby 's attention . my only problem is the piece for the top . whenever i try to use it , the arms bow in and it does n't look very sturdy . i also have trouble using this piece and the mat on the ground . it just does n't seem very sturdy and i have tried everything . other than that , i am glad that i bought this !
baby	shoppers beware : the item itself is a great item but i have received the worst shipment ever from my online orders : 1-even though the item is advertised in amazon as new , i received an item which was previously used and apparently for a long long time . the rocker seat was dirty and smelled . 2-even though the seller charges more than 9 dollars for shipping , they did not bother to put the manufacturer fragile box in a mailing box . therefore the package arrived cut in several locations with some of the items bulging out . 3-some of the accessories are missing and i can bet the previous owner forgot to return them
baby	do n't buy peg-perego their customer service is horrible ! ! i will never buy from them again ! !
baby	the safety 1st cosco portable crib is great ! i purchased this for my first grandchild when she visits . it 's small enough to fit anywhere and it can easily be rolled from one room to another . i would recommend this to anyone looking for an alternative to a full size crib . it is very sturdy and also attractive
baby	waste of money . does not fit most car seats and the info on the package does not specify this
baby	i tried my new bowls out this morning and was very disapointed . the suction wo n't stay down for more than a second or two on our wood table . on the kitchen counter top ( formica ) they stay put for longer but not long enough for a meal . i am returning mine to the store today . dissapointing . but , they are darling colors and the lids are a nice feature
baby	this is a great pump for a mom who only needs to pump once or twice a day . let down happens very quickly and i can get 3 oz . in 15 to 20 min . my baby is a month old and i use this pump so i can occasionally leave my baby with a sitter . geat pump at a great price
baby	i discovered this product recently when i had my second baby . i received it as a baby shower gift and i love it . it is so much easier than swaddling with a blanket . i have now bought the large one and my son ( 3mos ) has yet to figure out how to get out of it . the other thing that i like about it is that you can wrap the wings around the baby 's waist or upper chest , leave his arms out , and use it during the day like a blanket . voila , a blanket that wo n't fall off when you 're holding him , or be kicked off when he 's lying down . kiddopotamus has really come up with some great products . you might also want to check out the piddle pad . another great invention/product by kiddopotamus
baby	my daughter loves to kick the blankets off during the night and i was always worried that she would get cold , especially with the very cold weather we have had so far this winter . i saw this and knew it would be perfect for my little kicker girl ! she wears it every night now and i know she stays warm throughout the night . the only suggestion i have for anyone thinking of buying this , is to make sure you get the right size and length for your little one . mine is growing so fast that i will have to get a bigger size soon just because she is getting so long
baby	i recently purchased this product to ease my bach aches when bathing my 3 year old son . it definetly relieved some of that uncomfortableness , however , the problem i encountered with this product is the top portion ( elbow pad ) adhering to the side of the tub . it does not always suction properly and often times would fall off the edge of the tub . the other day my son tried putting it back and suctioning it to the side of the tub . there was a little moisture on the edge of the tub , the top slipped and he slammed his mouth onto the top of the tub . he sustained a severly cut lip and jammed his top front teeth . there was blood everywhere . his teeth are loose now but should be okay . his lip is healing up but he was in pain for quite a while . i would like other parents to be aware of this potential accident in hopes that their child will not be injured .
baby	i registered for this kit and got two - at first i considered taking one back , but i am glad i did n't . it is great to have way more of these necessities to start off with , that 's months of not having to remember to buy any ! i love the bucket-thing this comes in - one currently holds all our bath stuff for easy toting to the bathroom . the other one is our bib-holder , since we have a ton of bibs . it keeps them neat , all in one place and closes and can be put away for guests . the vapor bath is fantastic . we just got over my son 's first cold and it worked like a charm . he loves baths to begin with and this filled the whole bathroom with that soothing vapor and within minutes i could hear the difference in his breathing ! when i caught the cold a few days later , i have to admit , i also took a vapor bath and it was better than a hot shower for clearing my congestion ! i do n't know that the lavendar one necessarily calms or soothes the baby , but it smells nice . we 've gotten shampoo in his eye at least once with no tears or fuss , so it must not burn . i definitely recommend getting this for new moms-to-be
mag	i have only received the paper for 2 weeks . where is it ? why did it stop comin
mag	imagine making a beehive cake or a honey-citrus iced tea . when looking through this magazine you need a good cup of tea and a pair of scissors . you will be cutting out a lot of recipes ! in fact , i 'm sitting here cutting out recipes in between typing . there are 16 pages of recipes in a `` card '' format . the favorite meal section and cooking for one or two is always of interest . it shows you how to put an entire meal together and all the recipes are included . there is also a section where you can view enviable country kitchens . then you can learn how to make ordinary foods extraordinary . add curry powder to chicken salad or add brewed coffee to cookie dough . the `` men who run the range '' section is a series featuring men who love to cook and then you can also find out what people are eating in various states across the country . these are ideas and recipes from real cooks across america . one time i looked in the `` does anyone have ... ? '' section and found a note about a woman who was looking for specific items . after sending her a small box , she then reciprocated and sent me the most beautiful framed pressed flowers . it is a fun section where you can read about recipes people are looking for and if you have the recipe , there is an address where you can mail the item . i recently learned how to make rosemary crackers and someone is looking for a recipe for various crackers . this magazine also has info on cooking schools all over the country . you could also be a field editor and share your recipes , cooking tips and other ideas with the home-office staff . you could literally end up in this magazine ! some of the delicious recipes i 've been clipping from this magazine include : grilled sirloin steak crispy fried chicken herbed seafood skewers chicken with rosemary vegetable cheese tortellini grilled turkey burgers beehive cake honey citrus iced tea tonight i made a chicken dish with homemade stuffing and a mushroom gravy that my husband really loved . i think this magazine inspires me to cook more and i have never read this magazine without tearing out pages galore . now i 'm dreaming about the pear crisp with lemon sauce and the raspberry cheesecake pie . ~therebeccareview.com
mag	there are a few magazines about writing serious writers need to read . `` poets writers '' is one of them . it has a literary bent , but avoids the nose-in-the-air attitude . it is practical and educational , and is pleasingly presented . a favorite factor for me are the long feature articles on the culture of writing . in the issue out now , there are two major articles . one is about author stuart dybek and his fiction that pulls from his experience growing up on chicago 's colorful south side . the other is about writing contests , dealing with how ethical they are run , the view of literary judges , and when a writer should considering entering one . the secondary articles are as informative and as useful , whether you want to learn about promoting your book , doing online workshops or understand the trends driving the industry . contests , incidentally , are a big part of pw 's value . the magazine tells you who won , and which contests/grants are currently accepting submissions . pw is careful to screen which contests are listed , ensuring only legitimate ones make it through the editors . the writing itself is interesting . it is not always true that writing magazines are fun to read . it should be , and in the case of pw , everything is engaging . pw 's design is clean . it looks like what a small press literary magazine should look like . the typography and layout are not pretentious or overbearing , but get the job done . it is never work to read this magazine . i fully recommend `` poets writers . '' you will be better informed about writing and writers , just like the titles implies . anthony trendl editor , hungarianbookstore.co
mag	although i have yet to subscribe to aperture , what i 've heard and what little i 've seen advertised in one of sally mann 's famous publications is enough to arouse my interest , and i ca n't wait to partake of a first issue of 'aperture ' . feedback from other members is always anticipated and welcomed
mag	i absolutely love this magazine ! it is a wonderful motivation for anyone who wants to be healthy and strong . i will be 38 in a few weeks , and am considering competing in a fitness competition because of this magazine . i read it from beginning to end , and my husband even reads it . he always asks if i saw the article on this or that , which is an indication that the information presented is useful and engaging . if you are serious about your health , want to get in shape or want to take your body to the next level , this is the magazine for you
mag	i read rolling stone for the music and those who make it , not for some guilt ridden , agenda blasting editorial team that feels their politics ( and guilt at being so much the establishment they wish they could hate ) is something we should all read about at nauseum . when they stick to music , it 's good , when they parade their shreiking political views , it 's boring .
mag	paula 's magazine is wonderful ... unlike what one of the reviewers wrote about the recipes being bland . they are all from paula 's cookbooks , new recipes or from her friends . none are bland ... they are pure paula and all have the wonderful southern flare she is known for . i have been fortunate enough to meet paula in person and was at a recent taping of her new t.v . show paula 's party ... this magazine is just another wonderful extention of her many talents !
mag	yes , t is the oldest continually published magazine in the usa , and it 's their 160th anniversary . however , i see little reason to celebrate . why ? because i fail to see how it 's really improved over the years . nowadays , this magazine seems to cater far too much to the material lusts of the `` nouveau riche '' . back in the day when it was a true `` high society '' magazine , there were rather interesting and educational articles on the arts , literature and culture . it was beautiful and it really gave a person something to aspire to , but now just like so much of the rest of society has mutated into a lot of pretentious materialist wannabees bragging about `` bling bling '' , so has this magazine . there are far too many adverts for so-called `` luxury goods '' for my tastes , and although they put in a patronizing article about women over age 60 being the new `` power '' base , they insist on using only thin 20-something models who probably ca n't afford the clothes they are modeling ! articles wise , they are starting to sound more like glamour or cosmo than the erudite publication i used to enjoy buying on the newsstands 20 years ago . yes , t has changed with the times ... but these are not good times if that is the case . it 's too bad
mag	was very dissapponted with this magazine . they go unread and get thrown out . just waiting for our subscription to run out . it is really for older kids and of very little interest to younger kids
mag	i recieve different magazines over the course of a year . i do n't know why . it simply happens that way . marie claire is a pleasant surprise . i found in the first issue i read , a group of writers , editors and all involved with this magazine , not just writing about issues , but being proactive . everyone on the street in nyc in bikinis and whatever each individual felt comfortable with , to bring awareness to skin cancer . really cool ! each issue has write ups on a certain amount of relevant international and national news for women and other sexes too . they are adding the right amount of consciousness to an otherwise totally fashion magazine which also i have found surprisingly refreshing and fun . ace job marie claire staff ! !
mag	the new yorker has made it 's way to our kitchen table since i was tall enough to see over the edge of the table . my mom was an avid reader and now i buy the magazine , cause she would have wanted it that way . i like it for the cartoons and i 'm absolutely naive when it comes to politics , so i need this magazine to get some idea of what is going on . with all the blogging and other nonsense , i feel secure that the new yorker does diligent fact checking before it prints something , so i rely on it where i wo n't rely on news printed on the internet . regards , lar
mag	my mom was a subscriber to newsweek for years , and i 'd flip through her copies . most of the material is friendly towards the powers that be ( although , not friendly enough according to the review by the soldier who thinks the editors should be in jail . so much for `` protecting our freedoms '' ) . anyway , since newsweek is beholden to big business advertisements , it wo n't do much to rock the boat that our corporate mafia owns . if people are interested in more honest , more critical views of the political and economic system that is causing so much devastation in the world ( the neoliberalism of the us empire and other wealthy nations ) , then i 'd recommend z magazine . i 'll never forget finding my mom on the floor devouring it 's articles on a range of issues the corporate media marginalize . z also publishes articles and interviews with the most-cited living author on the planet , noam chomsky ( another figure i 'm sure the us soldier thinks should be in jail . although , chomsky recently spoke at west point . so , even the military is waking up to the hard truths he brings ) .
mag	i dont know what can i write . i want anything about art exactly about painting , drawing , modern ar
mag	this magazine is another part of the murdoch empire . its worst sin is that its boring and not very conservative . it was founded by william kristol , john podhoretz and fred barnes to be a institutional conservative publication under tight control and with deep enough pockets to dwarf its smaller rivals . when conservativism was a living movement , it was best characterized as a collection of independent voices who while they respected each other did n't always agree with each other . now , following the murdoch formula , its about getting as many people whatever their ideology on the payroll . the price of being on the payroll is of course not rocking the boat . reading conservative publications these days is like reading the transcripts of someone engaging in a monologue in an echo chamber . its strange that there is so much `` conservative '' media today , but that most policy decisions do n't get debated or even discussed among conservatives . they seem more interested in covering liberals than discussing ideas or making proposals . and for god 's sake , no more articles by those who are agnostics in their private life talking about how america needs more god this or god that . if your going to be religious , at least find someone who is sincere . and no more articles on the greatness of family by childless unmarried women who are totally devoted to careers to the exclusion of anything else .
mag	i got american girl when i was nine . and now im going on my thirteenth birthday and still love it . i think you can be intreseted in teen people type magazines but still love american girl . it has lots of crafts and my favorite part-the `` lunch box '' section where they have ideas for food to make and take in your lunch to school . it is a short magazine , but they make up for it by having the jumbo summer issue . i think its definitaly worth the money .
mag	`` the economist '' is a great weekly magazine with in-depth , balanced and enlightening journalism . the articles are largely expertly written by knowledgeable people . the writing in `` the economist '' is interesting and insightful with articles conveying detailed and yet condensed information . the magazine has contributions from senior people from all over the world , making it interesting and relevant to a worldwide readership . the editors and journalists of the economist need to be applauded for the broad range of well-written articles with balanced analysis every week . reading this magazine ensures that i know what is happening worldwide every week , although i do not always agree with some positions the magazine takes . this is recommended reading for business leaders and decision makers who require a diverse range of views and information about what is happening at different places in the world on subjects as diverse as politics , current affairs , science and technology , national , regional and global issues , finance , trade , and development . even great people like nelson mandela relied on this magazine for news during his long years in prison .
mag	this is a magazine i frequently get confused with foreign affairs magazine . the primary difference is the longer well-written essays by leading experts in affairs whereas foreign policy has a more frequently published , more up to date and more direct version of the other . it would be great to have both since policy keeps you more current with a high degree of professionalism while the other gives you the deeper detail . if you do n't have a lot of time to read , policy is the one you 'll need and enjoy .
mag	i'de have never read vibe in the first place , but i won a free years subscription in some online contest . and i must also mention i 'm a huge fan of hip-hop and hip-hop culture , so i'de think vibe would be tight ... ..daamn , was i ever wrong . first off , half the mag is advertising ... .then what little reading there is ... .it 's all bullsh** . the interviews they have with artists are totally weak watered down . they never ask any worthwhile questions . vibe also contradicts itself constantly . in one issue , they 'll give an album a low rating a poor review , then at the end of the year they name that same album one of the years best ... .what the f*** ? vibe has it 's decent moments , but i def . wo n't be paying for it anytime soon .
mag	i use this magazine for my three kids ( ages 9 , 11 , and 13 ) who are homeschooled . they love the magazine because it makes history more fun than dry textbooks and they get to really experience what life was like in a certain era . each article includes discussion questions , activities , movies , web sites and additional books to read . what is so great about this is that when one of the kids is really interested in something , they can jump off and explore more on their own - perfect for self-directed learning . and it saves me time in tracking down this stuff . some of the more memorable articles were ones like `` how to storm a castle '' , `` hobo signs in the depression '' , `` success in ancient china '' and `` how chocolate conquered europe '' - definitely not standard-fare topics , but fun nonetheless . my kids are getting hooked on history as a result ! sure , it 's $ 5 per issue , but it 's pretty thick ( 60+ pages ) and has no ads . you can check out a sample issue online on their web site to see if it is right for your kids
mag	i ordered this magazine a year ago , and my nephew still have n't receive a single magazine ! every time i email customer service they would tell me that it 's coming next month . i will let you how the magazine is when i get it , but do n't hold your breath .
mag	i paid i never received magazine at all even though i received all four of the other magazines that were ordered at the same time
mag	this magazine is almost as bad as consumer reports . their comparison tests never adhere to their thesis about what the tests is measureing , for example a comparison test is said to be about quick acceleration and on point handling and then the car with the lack lust performance in handling and acceleration would be # 1 in ranking . often , the car reviews are always mentioning information about a car that is n't relevant , or does n't make sense , or the review is n't consistent with the posted viehicle stats . the magazine also seems to be biased . some vehicles are criticized with more irrelevant information than others to say its awful . after further reading of many issues , you would think they are playing favortism towards certain brands or recieving kick backs from manufacturers , for example , you will always see the domestic brand being referred to as basically `` trash '' and a japanese brand or a bmw is always the way to go , when once again the posted stats and sometimes photos say different.this is more noticeable when you can predict the out come of their reviews . ultimately , its a bad guide towards getting any information on automobiles period . its the pat robertson of auto magazines . if it were possible , i woudl n't even give this magazine 1 star .
mag	this is my favorite magazine in the universe and the only one to which i have ever subscribed . however , after this , my second subscription is over , i plan to call it quits . the magazine never gets delivered unless i send several angry e-mails every month reminding them and demanding delivery . when the issues come they are often 2-3 months behind . the current issue is over three weeks late and who knows when and if i will ever see it . in the end , although this is a brilliant publication , it simply is n't worth the headache . photo , if you 're out there , please forward me the june issue ... . and while you 're at it get a head start on july and august and maybe they 'll make it on time
mag	this magazine has great recipies ! most of them are incredibly easy , but there are a few `` adventuresome '' ones every once in a while to try when you feel up to a challenge . sometimes the recipies need a few more spices , so i usually add more than they say ( heck , it does n't change the calorie count ) . however , cooking light does not trade calories for taste , so the whole family likes the meal and there are many recipies that i would proudly serve to company ( the majority , in fact ) . there are also just a ton of recipies per issue . the only negative things i would say is that a few of the recipies are only marginally `` healthy '' and sometimes there 's some redundancy . overall , it 's a great buy
mag	runners world covers everything about running from which shoes and why to race preparation to nutrition and technique . there is no magazine better for runners
mag	golf digest is the best magazine , covers great players , have standard lessons from top golf teachers and schools and allways very useful tips . however , it only has one thing against ... too much advertising or too many advertisers ! !
mag	when the armchair detective stopped being published , i was without a good mystery magazine . i received a complimentary copy of mystery scene and i subscribed to it . the magazine is published 5 times per year and features great interviews and good book reviews . i especially enjoy their reviewing lesser known authors and books by independent publishers . my favorite part is the `` where are they now '' which features authors who seem to have stopped writing a particular series , many of whom i have read in the past . an excellent publication
mag	i discovered the am some 2 or 3 years ago . since then , i have become an addicted reader to it . more than to any other magazine at the moment . let 's start saying what the am is not : is not about news , is not about business , is not about nice and colored pictures . the am has two main focuses . one is current affairs , with a special focus on the macro conditions of the us ( mainly economy and politics ) and international affairs . the other one is the arts , with a special focus in reviewing high-quality ( and sometimes rare ) books . i like the am for its focus in current affairs . in this monthly you will read long articles about issues like , to cite some examples that come to mind : - simulation of a principals meeting to discuss alternatives to engage with north korea - war game of an attack to iran - presidential candidates , their lives and their campaign strategies - state of affairs of the american educational system - potential causes of an eventual economic crisis in the us the am sits in the same `` hall of fame '' as the economist and foreign affairs . the main differences are that the economist has a relatively short time frame and thus focuses on the news of the week and what they mean for the mid term . foreign affairs , on the other hand , is more scholarly in nature . the am sits somehow in the middle . it is written mainly by senior journalists ( so it 's less scholarly ) and its monthly focus allows it to disentangle itself from the relative `` sameness '' of every week 's news . the am goes beyond the `` futility '' of news reporting but stops before it gets into the `` boringness '' of scholarly writing . if you want to enrich your view of the world with a quality monthly , if you are open-minded and are willing to read new points of view , if you want to get closer to the real issues behind foreign and economic policy , the am is for you . on the other hand , if you have more `` short-term '' preocupations , if you are more `` closed '' than open to new points of view , or if you want to look at international and economic matters with a more scientific approach , then the am is not for you . again , as i said , the am also has an `` arts '' section . it 's very good but it 's not the reason why i buy it . other may
mag	'sports illustrated ' is the one sports magazine which covers in a good way all the major sports . it has been a feature of american life for over half a century . one of the features i recently took great interest in reading was its list of the one- hundred greatest sports books .
mag	for ads only pretty much . there is not much to read or learn for the common reader . it seems like it 's mailing for the fashion elite not for everyone .
mag	this magazine is fun and upbeat . the pictures are bright and colorful but more importantly they add to the text . if the text is about cooking a steak for example the pictures will be clear and easy to understand and will fully document what the text is saying . there are many many recipes . one section actually has a pull out shopping list and menus for a week . a great magazine . well worth the money .
mag	i 'm referring to the u.k version of this magazine but my sentiments are the same as that written by most of the other reviewers . this mag has deteriorated so much over the last few years . i recent ; y discouraged my son from reading this magazine as it almost resembled a soft porn mag ! also , if you were to follow the routines in this magazine , you will just end up overtrained and frustrated with your lack of results . why ? the rotuines listed here only work if you have 6 days a week and two hours a day to train . and it also requires that you live on supplements ! most of the 'champs ' feautured in this magazine are just paid to say they use the supplements . in reality they are all surgically enhanced and are on large amounts of anabolic hormones . there is no way the routines in this mag will work for typical people . please look elsewhere
mag	i was ecstatic when i received this magazine subscription as as gift . two issues into my subscription it stopped . i was really anticipating the december issue because i had many guests coming and could use some of martha 's helpful advice , however it never came and neither did january or february . i have called martha stewart living magazine twice and while they are very nice and apologetic , i still have not received another issue . when i asked to cancel for a refund i was given a phone number with an automated system that uses a credit card account look up - being that it was a gift this is useless . very clever for martha and very frustrating for the giftee/consumer
mag	why pay $ 34 when you can buy the magazine at a bookstore and order a subscription for $ 19.9
mag	the london review of books is , without a doubt the best literary journal in the world : at the same time erudite , entertaining and informative , each issue is a foray into a world of knowledge that is all too lacking in other publications and media . there was a time in my life when i could n't afford to put my heating on in the bitterly cold british winter , but i never thought to cancel my subscription to the lrob . highly recommended
mag	`` the wall street journal '' is nothing less than america 's true newspaper of record , a window on the world of business , finance , international affairs , and all the delicious little nuggets of news that would otherwise slip through the cracks . i am a media carnivore : i am news-addicted . i get my news in hourly , massive slabs : from cnbc , from cnn , from the internet -- -and best of all , in the brain-shatteringly early hours of the morning in the form of my daily wall street journal ( kudos goes , as well , to my unfailingly faithful early-rising journal deliveryman ) . with that high praise i also must dispatch a warning to the curious : if you subscribe to the journal -- -and if you want to be informed and ahead of the game , then you must ! -- -you 'll discover , possibly for the first time , intense agonies of guilt . the journal is , every single day , chock full of so many juicy , delicious , insanely informative , amazingly well-written , positively balanced nuggets of journalism on finance , politics , economics , technology , market trends , literary explosions -- -so much , in fact , that it 's an embarrassment of riches . if you 're busy -- -and who is n't ? -- -then you simply wo n't have time to read everything . like caesar 's roman gaul , the wall street journal is also divided into three parts : the front page , marketplace , and money investing . page one is my beachhead in the morning : i scan the middle two columns for the financial and geopolitical earth movers -- -and if i have the time , i can dig into the paper for all the gory details . the news here is uniformly objective : opinion is cut out , the wounds cauterized , and the unbiased opinion itself served up piping hot on the journal 's editorial page . marketplace deals with macro and micro business trends , and is always engagingly written . sometimes the supplement `` personal journal '' accompies the fleet out ; more often than not , there 's another tasty little section dealing with mutual funds , technology trends , industry strategies , and quite a bit more . it 's a veritable treasure-house of knowledge , and since gordon gekko was right -- -the most valuable commodity in the world is information -- -the wall street journal serves as purveyor of that most critical , that most precious commodity . and , i might add , serves it up with spice , brains , guts and panache . oh , and money investing is a fly-by of all the major financial trends of the day : m , economics , currency , commodities , oil making investors shake and quake , big stock movers . all good stuff . finally -- -and i 'm biased , be warned -- -the editorial page is the best on the planet , and i always scour it at lunch -- -always . if you want to be informed -- -if you want to be light years ahead of your arch-rival , that nasty vp of finance hastings down the hall , which naturally you do -- -you should at the very least read the editorial page . it is incisive , delicious , never boring , brimming with opinion and intelligence . yum . the journal is with me in the nosebleed hours of the early morning , right beside my boiled eggs and toast and steaming cup ( s ) of coffee . and it 's with me in the evening , when i actually get to dip into it , at leisure , with my cigar and scotch . so subscribe to it , i say : the wall street journal is an important , glorious , massively influential american institution . it 's your window on the world of affairs . it 's what the movers and shakers of the british empire might have read had the empire survived into the 21st century : and yes , you have the news of the world , at your fingertips , hauled back from the journal 's far-flung outposts across the globe : from hong kong , london , kuala lumphur . sincere kudos to the journal 's officer corps : karen elliott house , the publisher ; paul steiger , managing editor ; and paul gigot , editorial page editor -- -and the brilliant , dedicated , blindingly talented team of reporters that work with them . bravo ! for a decade now , not a morning has dawned without my journal : it is my polestar and compass . it makes me richer , which makes me happier . it is a tasty read . stop gawking and subscribe .
mag	i am still not receiving this magazine . and i had a gift subscription on that order , too . i 've been meaning to get in touch . thought it had been more than long enough for subscription to start
mag	when funds were tight i had a difficult time deciding which magazine subscriptions to keep . each women 's magazine has a slightly different feel in the writing , though with increased competition , these styles seem to be in flux . i finally decided that i preferred the writing in bazaar and was getting tired of what i felt was vogue 's cosmopolitan attempt to catch a larger readership ( if i want to subscribe to cosmo , i 'll bloody well subscribe ) . the featured designers are more cutting edge and less mainstream than what is found in vogue . it 's a bit snottier ( though there are far snottier magazines if you are looking for extreme fashions ) . among my complaints : bazaar is an obviously thinner magazine , and while most of vogue 's content is adverts , it does seem to have more articles . another item that i find highly irritating , is bazaar 's society items . i really do n't give a -- -- who is wearing what at what charity gala , especially when i do n't play footsies with these people . those complaints aside , this is still my favorite fashion magazine
mag	a beautiful magazine - this one 's a classic ! not to be missed by all anglophiles .
mag	i picked up a copy of dwell in my brother 's mod condo he owns and thought , oh , not another boring design magazine . wow . i was really impressed with both the great pictures and the range of topics in this little gem . from `` chairs through the ages '' to a complete timeline of modern design ( toasters to ipods ! ) i just could n't stop saying `` ahhhh '' ! since this magazine is not available in many places ( such as the supermarket ) , it 's well worth a subscription . there are wonderful ideas for small spaces but also for larger homes too . it would make a great gift for a 20 something that is just getting into their first space . ( and hey , having it on your coffee table makes your hipness go up by about 100 % ~ ! )
mag	this bimonthly magazine is a wish book for those of us who do n't have two full-time gardeners on staff , or a few acres of woods to devote to bluebells , or the ruins of an ancient abbey to train roses against . my regency ancestors were breaking their backs on hardscrabble new england farms , rather than building follies or planting mazes , or having their grounds landscaped by capability brown . oh , but what if ... . i 've subscribed to `` the english garden '' for many years now , and i do n't think i 've ever gotten anything useful out of it , but the gardens photographed within its glossy pages are to dream for : acres of blooming rhododendrons ; statuesque old sequoias that were planted when victoria was queen ; lavender hedges ; outdoor rooms that have been replanted to a 17th century plan ; a sundial pool ; and of course , a bluebell wood . there are plenty of suggestions for the serious gardener . for example , the current issue ( july 2005 ) features the following : * for year round colour , buy a couple of peacocks . their screams will also scare away the burglars * one gentleman favors beer for slugs , `` although i do n't dare use it here - the gardeners would drink it ! '' * hazel twigs bent over beds and urns will deter the peacocks * add a touch of history to your garden with an italian carved white marble seat . it can be picked up at sotheby 's garden statuary sale for a mere 25,000 - 40,000 pounds . ( i absolutely lust for this bench , but alas my pension must be spent elsewhere ) * `` use perfumed plants in the conservatory because the warmth generated by the glass pumps fragrance through the house '' * plant marigolds in your walled kitchen garden to keep `` eelworm and whitefly at bay '' * flank the path to the summerhouse with rhododendrons and white narcissi * to break up a long path , use arches `` lightly clothed with jasmine or clematis '' if some of the above tips are a bit too steep for your pocketbook , you can do like me and drool over the marvelous photographs of someone else 's jasmine arch and italian carved marble .
mag	there is never a dull moment with this magazine ! you never know what the next story is going to be ... just that it will be a great read ! really good photography and illustrations too ! so if you are interested in what makes this world tick ... check out smithsonian magazine
mag	i ordered this on may 5th for mother 's day , and was advised that the actual subscription may take 6-8 weeks , but that a card would be mailed to my mother within 3 days . it was not mailed until june 27th , she still does not believe i was thinking of her on mother 's day . as of june 30 , she still has not received her first magazine either . allow extra time when ordering if it is for a timely item
mag	this mag needs a new editor . i have n't seen anything interesting in better homes for six months . maybe they are spread too thin with their website and contests
mag	the american spectator offers an eloquent and often humorous conservative viewpoint on the more pressing political and cultural issues facing the world today . the emphasis here is `` conservatism '' , not `` republicanism '' as tas is often highly critical of gop politics and policies that stray from conservative ideals . publications like tas counter the insidious , tendentious underpinings of the mainstream media , hollywood , and the mistake that is the united nations . i recommend you at least give it a look . samples of its content can be found at www.spectator.or
mag	not nearly as appealing as the other magazines i have read : motortrend , car and driver , automobile mag , sport compact . i do n't like any of the long racing articles and anything on old cars . car and drivers off topic articles tend to be more interesting and occasionally very funny
mag	i have been scrapbooking for more than five years , and i my style is rather simple . however , i recently found myself in a rut , and i began wishing i could do the fancier pages , so i began receiving creating keepsakes . although i still have no desire to do a two page spread that takes 5+ hours , this magazine has been great at inspiring me to try new things , as well as just giving me ideas for both scrapbooking and stamping , in just the first three issues of my subscription . they do a fairly good job of showing the expensive way to do a page , as well as the more economical . additionally , there are product reviews and recommendations . i typically buy most of my supplies from at-home parties , i found a very helpful recommendation for a silent eyelet setter . some of their articles are geared towards the more advanced/ambitious scrapbooker . for instance , a recent article explained how to use certain computer programs to augment photos . the results were beautiful , but this was just not up my alley . they also recently did a spread on the scrapooking rooms of some of their staff , and i was very , very jealous ! i may never have any award-winning spreads , and i probably will never use my computer to augment my pictures , but i know my scrapbooking will be more creative and better looking due to this magazine
mag	i suscribed to this magazine since i got a great offer on it from the company i get my other suscriptions from so i decided , why not ? ? its been a year and , although the previews of each week 's prime-time programs are fun ( 2 pages worth ) i was very dissapointed . the articles are empty , boring and some downright retarded ; rehashing show 's dialogues , requoteing newscomments - its a mistery to me how this magazine is still around . i realize this is an entertainment magazine , but still , the articles in people magazine seem like rocket science in comparison - gasp ! ! ! do yourself a favor and just buy a tv guide - much more interestin
mag	i love this magazine ( not because of the big ole booty 's ) , because of the way they present the ladies . i have never seen a cover of king showing some skinny , no meat eating , starving her self to death type chic ! they show real women , with real shapes . it shows how women look in the real world ! i love it , and yeah i must admit , i do love the big ole booty 's ! ! sorry ladies , i am a man ! lol
mag	the most amazing thing about american iron is their tech articles . pictures are used to illustrate various steps in a process and , unlike most of the other harley rags ' , the photos are crisp and detail the step ! they really seem geared to a joe average reader who is not milling out the bore of their bike on a regular basis
mag	my husband is a watercolor artist and we used to order this magazaine directly . now with the amazon service , we not only get the magazine a little cheaper , we get it renewed easily via emails from them . excellent service
mag	this magazine compares favorably to `` american heritage '' with its interesting and accessible but well-researched accounts of the past . each issue focuses on a person ( i just read the story of thomas aquinas -- and had n't realized his fascinating interaction with muslims ) or a movement ( the huguenots , who 's sad history led to their dispersal from france to all over the world -- including the revere family moving to massachusetts ) . all in all , an intriguing glimpse at how christians of the past continue to influence us today
mag	i ordered this as a gift for my neice for christmas . it 's june , and she has yet to get a copy . i called them in march , and they verified they have her correct name and address in their computer . i 'll going to ask for a refund
mag	i started ordering glamour 2 months ago , and honestly it is a huge disappointment to me . there are so many ads in this magazine its unbelievable . ladies , my advice is to save your money for a different magazine..i dont recommend glamour at all .
mag	people is a great magazine ! it has all the gossip without the drama of some of the other magazines . i got my first issue faster than expected ! i ordered sept. 22nd and have been reading for 3 or 4 weeks already ! : ) if you are looking for a weekly mag - this is the one to pick !
mag	amazon sells a one year subscription for $ 14 which includes a $ 5 amazon certificate that you get later . in the actual magazine , the subscription card is 6.99 for one year or 2 years for $ 10.00 so use the card , save some money and also dont have to wait for your $ 5 back and then find something at amazon that you can use the $ 5 certificate on .
mag	our ranger rick issues are used first as reading material , then discussion material , then project material ( cut-outs , etc ) then recycling to neighbors who enjoy them just as much . tear out posters line my son 's walls . there is no objectionable material in the magazine , just wholesome , fun reading . no political agenda is discernable from it , which is refreshing . as soon as it comes in the mail , my 10 year old insists on sitting right down and reading the whole thing through . the knowledge the magazine imparts carries over into the school day , where his teacher is amazed at his recall and knowledge .
mag	i hate this magazine . i subscribed sight-unseen based on the good reviews , and find the recipes are for food that no one in my house would ever eat ... way too exotic . if you like good ol ' american fare , do n't buy this one
mag	although 'camping life ' does contain a nice article or two each issue , the thrust of the magazine seems more to be a showcase of nice big campers/rv 's rather than the experience of camping and related camping activities . i subscribed sight unseen from the boy next door who was selling subscriptions for school . i will definitely let this subscription lapse . there 's just not enough love of camping and the outdoors in the magazine . however , if your camping interests run more to great big rv 's and all the related gear , you might find some value here that i did not
mag	psychology today is just another glamour/cosmo/people disguised as a magazine discussing issues in psychology . this magazine used to be well-written and had more scientific data . however , since the appointment of the new editor , headlines became similar to that of tabloid magazines all over . if you are interested in scientific data and research , this is not the magazine for you . i used to subscibe to psychology today but stopped renewing since i took more psychology classes becuase i found out that the magazine had no new insights to offer in the field of psychology at all
mag	this magazine is like no other . the interviews are fantastic , the pictures are great , and it 's very original . i can understand people not liking it if they 're used to and prefer the typical , predictable magazine format . it 's not for everyone , but for people of a certain people , it 's heaven
mag	it is impossible to review this item as item was never received . i have found it very difficult to contact anyone to find out where this item is
mag	okay so the pictures of the girls are not my thing but where else can you read a fresh look about cars , eating healthy and fashion ? ladies , this is a must read in order to talk to men ! it features fun topics sure to entertain and assist in carrying conversation with all the guys
mag	i started reading the economist after a recommendation from a professor during my undergrad years . that was 9 years ago . reason blended with wit and intelligence , the articles in the economist are a perfect antidote to the often insipid stuff put out by conventional newspapers . once i get my weekly edition , you could n't blow-torch it out of my hands ( my wife has tried ) . the economist is one of the few newspapers that has consistently defended the classical liberal perspective . free markets , civil liberties , and skepticism of those in power . in my opinion , it has no competitors . i could n't rate it highly enough
mag	i have been a smart money subscriber for over three years . i must say that each month i look forward to receiving the new issue . it needs to be said ( to those who are n't aware ) that this is a publication of the wall street journal . there is n't as much market news but the writing is just as good . from undervalued stock picks , to mutual fund screening and research , finding cheap bottles of good wine , car ratings , retirement planning and portfolio health - this magazine hits on many important topics for people in their working years . i find the writing to be accurate and insightful . i would still be a subscriber if the subscription was $ 3 per issue . that 's the true value i find in it . hands down it 's the best personal finance magazine around . head and shoulders above money kiplingers
mag	order placed early june . first issue of subscription not yet received . this is service
mag	ca n't give a review on maximum pc . never received the magazine . instead i was sent the men 's magazine fhm . please send my maximum pc
mag	i just received the latest issue of the green guide , titled 12 top products , and it 's a great issue . lots of good shopping info
mag	i decided that i had to write a review about newsweek this morning , after i came across yet another biased , over-hyped cover story . this particular one is entitled , `` rethinking the marriage crunch , '' and goes back on everything they presented 20 years ago about a woman 's chances of getting married later in life . this was undoubtedly very easy for them to do as they probably had no evidence for their assertion the first time around , and neglected to have any on this occasion . i really think another reviewer 's comparison to people is quite apt , but newsweek also provides a reliably pro-sexual revolution and pro-sixties counter-culture take on almost every issue . two years ago , we were made privy to another bit of front page sensationalism concerning `` infidelity chic . '' yes , it seems , according to their sources , spousal cheating is all the rage even though they argue , without even a hint of contradiction , that everybody still wants to get married as much as ever before . i find the magazine to be [ ... ] as they offer opinion instead of news ; theirs is a mission of persuasion . overall , there is little of which to recommend this publication as it is geared for a readership of trivial people who possess the depth of a kiddy pool .
mag	overall , this is the best gaming magazine i have read . it covers all consoles , gives sensible ( and funny ) reviews , and previews the hottest upcomming games . most games are reviewed by two people , adding to the accuracy of the score . it has a rating of 1-10 , 10 being the best , a rating which precious few games recieve . the previews section gives you a sneek peek of upcomming games . some of them are one page long , some ten . they all include pictures , and most have an estimated release date . also , there is a section on news in the game industry . ususlly near the beginning of the magazine , they include news on developers , consoles , and the big names in the industry . all in all , this is a great magazine , and well worth your money , because each issue is well over 100 pages
mag	i just renewed my subscription to glamour because they are one of the only magazines i have ever read that feature both a significant amount of affordable items ( i.e . less than $ 100 ) as well as intelligent , relevant articles about women and men . sure , they have their `` off '' months , but i really appreciate that ads do n't tend to dominate the magazine as much as others ( especially for as low as the subscription rate is ) . i also ca n't wait to see the `` do 's and don'ts '' every month
mag	i never received this magazine so how would i be able to rate it ? ? i cant even find a way to let them know i never received it
mag	i started ordering glamour 2 months ago , and honestly it is a huge disappointment to me . there are so many ads in this magazine its unbelievable . ladies , my advice is to save your money for a different magazine..i dont recommend glamour at all .
mag	as a reader , i become totally overwhelmed by the sheer number of books that come out each month . i usually rely on friends ' recommendations and more word-of-mouth advice , but that 's never been enough for me . reading a book is an investment to me , and i want to make sure my time is well spent . bookmarks gives me the confidence that i 'm choosing the books i truly want to read . i also find that the author profiles in bookmarks are timely and relevant to my broad tastes ( such as the ones on mario vargas llosa and the very interesting japanese writer , yukio mishima , which also shows that bookmarks looks globally , not only regionally , for classic authors ) .
mag	with its cheap pricetag and thick size , fantasy science fiction is definately one of the best . it splits it pages into fantasy science fiction stories and novellas with a few common columns between ( book reviews and strange facts ) . if you write fantasy or science fiction , pick magazine up
mag	a great magazine . i had a subscription for 2 years that ended about 6-8 months ago . i paid $ 104 for the 2 year subscription back then , but suddenly the price in the us has skyrocketed astronomically . i can go to any music store or a borders/barnes and noble and buy each individual magazine for anywhere from $ 8/issue to $ 9/issue typically , and i have never seen it more than $ 9/issue . however , suddenly the subscription they have is like $ 13 an issue , which is outrageous . it 's not amazon 's doing either , i was a subscriber for 2 years and this same thing happened to me . they asked me to come back at a lower rate ( something like $ 99/year ) , which is still $ 8.25 an issue . sure that 's might be a bit cheaper ( about 25 cents an issue on the average price above ) than buying each one in the store , but i doubt anyone would want every single issue individually , especially at tthat price . the upside is that uncut is far and away the best music/movie magazine in the world . i 'd say about 60-70 % of the issues i would have bought in the store when i was a subscriber . but until they begin printing the magazine in the states , it 's just not worth a subscription . the writing of the magazine is superb . brilliant and varied writing throughout . each magazine is about as big as a small book too , and of them i 'd read a good 80 % of the magazine too ( even finding myself reading some articles about artists i could care less about , because the articles were so well written ) , but the price is way too high to subscribe . it 's a shame too . rolling stone is nowhere close to being as good as uncut , and although mojo and q are strong , they ca n't hold the candle to it either . the only blemish on the magazine itself ( for all you who might want to buy a single issue ) is that the covers tend to repeat every 3-4 months , and i mean how much beatles can i read ( and i 'm in the upper 5 % of beatle freaks out there ) . still the magazine is well worth it , the subscription price is too incredibly high though to recommend in any circumstances . i would think this would be a great market to move into in the us if i was in that position . i do n't think rolling stone could compete anymore . if it would make things cheaper , i would do away with the `` free cd '' bonus too . aside from a few listens and the novelty of it all ( the free cd was a good incentive to make me interested a few years back ) , the cd 's get old quick , and after a while i would toss them out after a quick preview . summary : wait until/if the price drops , but do n't subscribe . it 's too expensive , and much cheaper to buy each magazine individually . the magazine itself though is 5 stars and almost always great
mag	the thing i hate about this magazine is the letters to the editor section . supposedly , they 're written by real people . but after reading this magazine for the last few years , these letters all seem to have the same maudlin , soporific , sappy style of prose that reads to me like they 've been edited that way . there 's this condescending `` athletes are supposed to behave like good ladies and gentlemen and if they do n't , then tsk tsk - what will the children think ? '' mentality that i absolutely hate . the good things about si are the photography and whatever articles on the nba they have any given week . and the swimsuit issue ? i guess if you 're a 13-14 year old it 's exciting as all get out - i 'll take the hard stuff any day over their annual fleshfest
mag	as an author i find oprah 's magazine to be the most inspirational any human being could use to start their month . `` divorcing a wife because you can not be all she needs is a very loving act . everyone deserves intimacy-emotional and physical . if a gay or bisexual man loves his wife , her happiness will be more important to him than his own . setting her free to allow her the opportunity to be loved as she deserves to be , is the ultimate expression of love . '' dennis j. schleicher
mag	this magazine is by far the best food , travel magazine out . a bit on the expensive side due to it coming from bbc in england but worth every pound ... dollar
mag	when weird tales was revived around 1988 , i was sorely disappointed in the direction the editorial staff had taken . it was too `` progressive '' and not enough like the old wt so many of us afficionados knew and loved . lin carter had a great thing going for the four paperback issues he came out with under the zebra imprint in the early 1980 's . unfortunately , he was not allowed to continue . his idea was to keep the flavor of the old weird tales alive , and he did it very well . then several years later along comes the the schweitzer/scithers/betancourt wt , and my goodness it was sad to see the aura gone . gradually , though , wt has seemed to come along and put itself somewhat more in the direction of the `` old-fashioned '' 'zine it was in its heyday ( 1920's-1930 's ) , although the editor darrell schweitzer would probably disagree with this observation . anyway , wt sports great covers now , good stories , and good book reviews , and interesting editorials . i must say i miss s.t . joshi 's always very entertaining book reviews , but we ca n't have everything . scott connors ' forthcoming reviews will surely entertain , as do douglas winter 's . all fantasy lovers should buy this magazine to support the cause of fantastic literature , especially the dark fantastic ; there are so few outlets of this kind now that whispers and weirdbook , not to mention the long gone forgotten fantasy , are no longer published . good job , mr. schweitzer , whether you realize it or not , your magazine has become a more cozy , old-style , aesthetically pleasing magazine , more in the true tradition of the original weird tales , thanks in no small part to the wonderful covers that have graced it in the last 13 or 14 years
mag	this magazine is great , ive thumbed thru 2 issues @ my salon , and i love it , there is so much information on black hair care , fashion , beauty etc . i think it might be the best black hair care magazine ive seen . i wish it was readily available in more stores !
mag	we just renewed this subscription for my wife 's mom , who lives in an assisted living facility nearby . she has thoroughly enjoyed the magazine and the residents have used the material as a discussion/project starter . thanks for your efforts at capturing this material and providing it for others
mag	this publication has no business calling itself a `` magazine '' ; published by san diego book distributor american marketing servies , this is nothing more than a fluffy info-mercial for its clients and publishers they want to woo . do n't waste your money
mag	occasionally when i go to the grocery store i pick up a magazine by the check out counter . so i bought an issue of fitness magazine and then decided to get a subscription . i do n't know what the heck i was thinking . each time i got the issue i noticed there was always some skinny blond chick on the cover wearing a bikini . there were never any women of color on the cover . so when i was sent a letter , asking if i 'd like to renew my subscription , i said he11 no . i 'm not wasting my money on a so-called fitness magazine that does n't feature women of color on its cover . there 's just no way . i thought fitness was for everybody , not just for skinny blondes who wear bikinis . and just because your skinny does n't make you `fit ' either . skip this if possible
mag	the best weekly news magazine on the market , time also gives science and technology updates , movie reviews , some celeb news , and provocative articles on world trends . well worth a subscription , especially if you do n't have time for the nightly new
mag	a woman that is passionate about beautiful things writes this review . i am an avid do-it-yourselfer and love to do things around the house . this magazine has been one of my favorites for years . i look forward to each new issue and the decorating ideas that it will provide . this magazine concentrates on upscale decorating , architecture and landscapes . many of the articles feature european country looks . the photographs in this magazine are absolutely beautiful . the july / august 2006 edition contained the following : 1 . venetian villa ( adrienne vittadini in sarasota florida ) 2 . nantucket renewal ( enlarging a classic cottage ) 3 . blooming intensity ( saturated with color ) 4 . coastal hues ( seaside radiance captured ) 5 . british accent ( this side of the pond ) 6 . the art of dining 7 . the view from veranda ( summer place ) 8 . tableaux ( staged elegance ) 9 . personal luxury ( cool coral ) 10 . on exhibit ( jungles in paris ) 11 . trade secrets ( summertime : fabrics , rugs , lighting ) 12 . passions ( birds of paradise : home aviary design ) 13 . showcase ( summer seating : for pool and porch ) 14 . verdant paths ( annevoie : belgium 's water garden ) 15 . the last word ( vanity flair : adrienne vittadini sketchbook ) there are many photographs of this magazine of both house interiors and exteriors that i find to be very inspirational from a decorating perspective . if you are looking for either painting or decorating ideas this magazine has much to offer . i have replicated some of the interiors in my own home . the exterior photographs of this magazine are always very appealing . i have been slowing changing the landscaping on my property to reflect a more italian way of life . i think you will be inspired to create an alfresco dining space after you have seen some of the beautiful landscape photographs . the merchants that advertise in this magazine are fabulous . i have purchased many items from them and have always been happy with my purchases . i highly recommend this magazine to anyone that loves interior design , or just likes nice things . this magazine is top notch all the way .
mag	amazon sells a one year subscription for $ 14 which includes a $ 5 amazon certificate that you get later . in the actual magazine , the subscription card is 6.99 for one year or 2 years for $ 10.00 so use the card , save some money and also dont have to wait for your $ 5 back and then find something at amazon that you can use the $ 5 certificate on .
mag	i wish i had something good to say but i ordered this barron 's subscription back in august 06 . i 've had this newspaper before and do enjoy it . it is now november and i 'm still waiting . i called customer service and amazon promised to resolve but that was several weeks ago . my next call will be to ask for my money back . hopefully this is n't happening to other subscribers . i 've ordered several other magazines from amazon and always received them on a timely basis .
mag	first off , i usually just stick to rating critiquing movies . but , every time i see an ad on this website for this time/warner ( or whatever the hell the company calls itself this week ) rag-mag i start to see red . `` entertainment weekly '' , which was once an interesting weekly deluge from the ho-hum of everyday life , has become just another rag crapped out weekly to stand on newstands week after week prostituting for your hard earned cash . back in the summer of 89 , `` ew '' was released and after i read a few issues , i decided to subscribe . i was instantly hooked ( the new issue would arrive in my mailbox the saturday before it would hit regular newstands ) i liked getting the latest news and reviews from movies , music , t.v. , and video ( that was later added in the mid-90 's ) . the problem with the magazine started in the late 90 's . i started to notice that `` ew '' would cover a big movie or event that had n't yet been released and then the following week bash the hell out of it , or try to get some piece of dirt on it in order to generate more sales . i also hate the damn lists that `` ew '' comes up with . the latest entitled `` the top 100 most memorable movie lines '' was a joke . these lists have always annoyed me , because i feel they are truly not thought out and therefore not thought provoking . the other most important thing i noticed was the absolute lack of an honest review . case in point , a few weeks ago i picked up the latest issue in which the movie `` catwoman '' had been reviewed ( i was n't to sure if it was gleiberman or shwarzbaum that critiqued it ) . i first logged onto `` rotten tomatoes.com '' to see what percentile `` catwoman '' recieved from the nation 's critics . out of roughly 115 reviews `` catwoman '' only got 10 % of the good reviews while the rest trashed it ( a film needs , at least , to get a grade of 60 - 65 % in order to place it as a fresh or good movie ) . that makes `` catwoman '' the worst reviewed film , so far , for 2004 . yet , `` ew '' gave the film a b . what erkes me even more is that `` catwoman '' is released by `` warner bros. '' , the same company that owns the rights to the `` harry potter '' films , `` the lord of the rings '' trilogy , yes , the `` wb '' owns `` entertainment weekly '' . is `` warner bros. '' trying to bribe or threaten its own critics at one of its most popular lucrative magazine 's ? i 'm not the only who has seen this developement . people have written in saying that there is favoritism among `` warner '' products that are reviewed in the magazine . `` ew '' , of course , hotly denies anything of the kind thumping there chests and standing behind there reviews , possibly in fear of being fired ( they will deny that also ) . my only question to the reviewers at `` entertainment weekly '' is , `` whats it like to stand in your own pile of bull**it ? '' or better yet , `` what 's it like to stand on a democratic podium ? ''
mag	if they made a television station with nothing but commercials , it would be like this magazine . had the publisher been more forthcoming , they would have entitled it `` rv reviews '' or something of that nature . there is little in this magazine having to do with actual camping . it 's almost exclusively rv articles . i 'm not opposed to rv camping ( i rather enjoy rv'ing too ) but i was under the impression that it covered tent camping as well . it does precious little of that ! the most unacceptable portion of the magazine is the fact that it 's just pages and pages of ads for rv 's and rv-related items . i would n't even recommend this to an rv owner as there just really are n't all that many articles here . the few articles they have are pretty good , but not great . look elsewhere for a good camping magazine .
mag	if you want to keep yourself in delusions and in the dark about what 's really going on in the world , read this magazine . national review is for people who sympathize with christian jihadists and white supremacists . would n't want to be in that camp if i were you . read time , mother jones , the nation , or the american prospect instead .
mag	i bought this as a gift for my son-in-law . he loves it . got it for him 2 years now . easy gift buying , and he enjoys a present i bought him all year .
mag	i grew up reading fangoria , when i could sneak it past my parents , that is . fangoria magazine has a total respect for the genere of horror that comes shinning through with every article . now you are not always going to agree with everything they say , but you can always expect them to be honest . when a horror icon is not performing up to snuff , like stephen king or john carpenter , they will be the first to point out the errors and flaws . fangoria also has the chainsaw awards , where you can mail in your vote for best horror movie , actor , ect , and you can also submit a name for horror hall of fame ( my guy has yet to win it ) . they also spot light horror films that would normaly fly under the radar of most people ; like the japanese and italian horrors ( wow , they can make some splatter flicks ) , and more independent films that would n't be showing at the mainstream theater . and they have pictures . all the blood and guts you can imagine in beautiful color ( though they have become more tame compared to what it was in the '80s ) . this is just a great magazine to have if your a horror fan , i whole heartedly recomend it
mag	i used to subscribe to this when it was all natural . then overnight they went to all drugs and sleaze and childish nonsense . i tried to get a refund but was ignored . unable to cancel my subscription i simply threw it into the trash can each month before my children would see it . i hate this magazine and would not allow it in my house once it was filled with nothing but drugs and insults . thank god there are much better alternatives . actually , any magazine any where is better . if and when they switch back to all natural i may buy it again , until then no way ! !
mag	i love the mag , but sister never recieved the order i gave her as a gift ! ! !
mag	this publication is , in my opinion , the most intelligent , funny , and readable magazine about pc games available . it blows the competition offered up by the u.s. magazines out of the water . you get : *a dual-sided dvd loaded with demos , movies , screenshots , podcasts , games , mods , patches , and compiled archives of games and hardware recommendations to view from your pc *humor which obliterates the drivel attempted by the us version . *lots of material- it 's thick and the pages are much bigger in size . you feel like you 're getting a real magazine rather then a flimsy , cheap catalogue of advertisements . *quality- both in the writing and physically . there are loads of articles with good insight into the industry every month . they are given lots of space and feel very scholarly to read . the pages are of good quality paper and the ink is crisp and clear , and is easy to read . pick up a copy of this from a shop like barnes and nobles sometime to see what it 's like . i guarantee you 'll be impressed , especially if you 're used to the gaming fare we get served this side of the pond
mag	smithsonian says it like it was , albeit short and sweet . without sprinkling complex grammar and cute expressions that are the hallmark of so many publications , smithsonian provides the latest meaningful scholarship , especially if it departs from traditional concepts . their photos are always profoundly informative and fresh , without cut and paste from the time-honored sources . their article on gavrilo princip , the assassin of archduke francis ferdinand , shook me to the core . thanks smithsonian .
mag	a must-have for all info junkies . from the bizarre to the informative , the diligent crew at mental_floss never ceases to dredge up something interesting . be the life of the cocktail party , be a mental_flosser
mag	i absolutely love this magazine ! it is a wonderful motivation for anyone who wants to be healthy and strong . i will be 38 in a few weeks , and am considering competing in a fitness competition because of this magazine . i read it from beginning to end , and my husband even reads it . he always asks if i saw the article on this or that , which is an indication that the information presented is useful and engaging . if you are serious about your health , want to get in shape or want to take your body to the next level , this is the magazine for you
mag	give me a break , people ! all spin magazine is a cheap rip-off/wanna-be of alternative press.i 've looked at like maybe ten or less issues of this waste of printed material in the past as many years.think i may 've saved one of those issues.sometimes , i 'll find an issue left by an uninterested patron at the post office that 's been left behind.i 'll then take it home , then likely toss it out after i 've looked through it twice.avoid at all costs
mag	this publication has no business calling itself a `` magazine '' ; published by san diego book distributor american marketing servies , this is nothing more than a fluffy info-mercial for its clients and publishers they want to woo . do n't waste your money
mag	i go to a gym where people share their magazines , and came across this gem . while it focuses on value vacation packages , the benefit that i 've gained from it is its list of 40 top vacation packages to destinations around the world . the magazine also offers an up-to-date web page describing even more places and bargains . it has really expanded my horizons about possible vacation spots . that alone is worth the reasonable cost
mag	mac world has become too costly . mac addict is economical and provides all the current info i require . good reviews and pleasant forma
mag	i dont enjoy this publication at all anymore , dont know if editorial leadership has change
mag	i think this magazine is really good . it gives you all the latest gossip on the best stars . it even answers your questions about some of the tabloids like : are jessica nick really over ? - i think it 's pretty wholesome too . the make-up tips are great . it 's the average teen girl 's fave mag
mag	if i see another picture of a blurred waterfall or creek i am going to puke ... i have not seen one truly imaginative , artistic image in this magazine . everything is run of the mill , boring , standard outdoor photography . lots of sunsets , flower fields . no different angles or perspectives , colors , nothing new . the articles are geared toward inexperienced photographers and really repetitive . i think i clipped one interesting article in a year worth of magazines..
mag	[ ... ] i got a choice of a free subscription to either parents or child magazine . since i already got parents , i chose child . i will not be renewing when my free subscription is up . the magazine is boring , the articles irrelevant and there are too many kids fashion pages . if you want a magazine about parenting/kids , go with parents .
mag	my biz partner and i were excited to receive our first mag from this group . we were sorely disappointed . most of the articles are not new information , but `` rehashed '' info widely available . we read it cover to cover for about 4 months , then cancelled the subscription . there are better sources out there and this is not one of them !
mag	golf digest is the best magazine , covers great players , have standard lessons from top golf teachers and schools and allways very useful tips . however , it only has one thing against ... too much advertising or too many advertisers ! !
mag	mother jones is what journalism should be : gutsy , honest , no-holds barred investigative reporting . regardless of your political party , this is one of the last vestages of honest reporting left available to us . everything from world news , the envirnment , american politics and current events is researched thoroughly and reported honestly . a must read for people interested in more news than is available the newspaper , or in newsweek and time . if your tired of the pathetic blather that parades as news these days , it 's time for mother jones .
mag	i have many men magazine , none comes close to men 's health . some magazines are too glossy that spell `` expensive '' for what ever they wanted to promote . with men 's health , i get to everything from a to z. i always pass my old copies to my local library for their own collection
mag	oprah is an inspiring role model for millions of people . i believe that her mission is well-known- to help people live their best possible lives . it 's rare to find another person who so consistently sticks to their `` mission '' and really change lives talk show after talk show , and magazine issue after magazine issue . if you want to make your life better , live more passionately and meaningfully then the oprah magazine will definitely help you out . it contains many interesting , inspiriting and balanced topics on a broad range of subjects written by excellent writers and contributors . i am glad that the magazine still contains many really readable and informative articles appropriate for every woman who wants to feel happy , empowered , informed and intelligent . i enjoy this magazine because it opens my mind to the world and celebrates life and womanhood . each issue has a theme such as love , health , home , fitness , etc . and will cause you to take a serious look at your life and see how you can further improve yourself . you will find interesting and up-to-date information about fashion , movie stars , book recommendations , delicious recipes , money , relationships and friends . my favorite section is her quotes on bookmarks . oprah winfrey is an example of a modern , smart and sensitive woman who consistently uses her talents and staff of editors to bring us the talk show and this wonderful magazine . i think that your greatest benefit will be to gradually realize and energize her main message-you should be the first priority in your life , because if you are confused , exhausted , dissatisfied , depressed then you will not be able to help anyone ! the magazine covers all of these important areas and i am pleased to recommend it . following oprah 's tradition to draw attention to books of great value i recently read and highly recommend to my male and female clients scientist ritz ' bestseller `` scientifcally guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex '' because it truly delivers great value and results . i dare say that this magazine and book will dramatically change your life for better
mag	i have read bird times many times . the articles are much less complicated than the bird talk magazine articles , which are fairly simplistic as well . i recommend that you look at the cover and see if there are any articles that you want to read . this magazine usually takes me 15-20 minutes to read , and that is if there is an interesting article . fewer ads than bird talk
mag	ever since i owned the magaines i thought how cool a magaizne full of naked guys . i have to say that i am glad that i already orded the magaiznes agai
mag	laptop magazine is an excellent resource for the mobile professional . the staff has done a great job of reviewing products relevant to those individuals attached to their laptops and related gadgets . despite the name , the magazine is not merely about laptops but also the tools and strategies for the peripatetic white-collar worker . with information on laptops , mobile phones , hotels and airlines , laptop magazine is loaded with great insights . its layout is excellent as it appears far less cluttered than other computer magazines - much like how the harvard business review differs from star magazine . yet , it is a bit light on specific computer tasks and tweaking . this may be due to the demographic of the audience , which is most likely a collection of mid-level executives and sales professionals instead of hands-on technology gurus . as such , the magazine is well worth the read as it will certainly save time with your work , travel , and technology purchases in the future . pros : excellent product information great organization and layout cons light on nuts and bolts computer technology no concise source of the laptop reviews ( i.e . like motor trend has a summary of tests with dates and results with every magazine ) .
mag	i also got this disgusting subscription `` invoice '' from these jerks . i do n't care how good a magazine is , if someone has to use deceptive , threatening and totally bogus marketing practices to ensnare new subscriptions , their magazine should not be rewarded with anyone 's business . i never ordered or got a single issue of their rag . only a repeating smack in the face via mailbox claiming i am going to be `` referred to a collection agency . '' kids discover , you will never get a cent out of me . last time i checked we still live in a land where we do n't have to pay for what we never got . if you spent as much time working on a good magazine for kids as you do sending out fake bills , you would have enough subscribers you would n't have to shanghai any new ones with your fraudulent billing scam .
mag	i 'm a big player of pc games , but i also love reading and thinking about my favorite hobby . for the past few years i 've been living in the uk , but when i come to the us ( and now that i live here again ) i would pick up the american version of pc gamer . i have to say , and i hope some of you take my word on this , the u.k. publication is light-years ahead of this one . the humour is grown-up ( not to mention actually funny ) and does n't drown the magazine . it 's bigger , the cover and pages are of much better quality paper and ink , the articles are neatly laid out ... added to this , the demo disc is a jam-packed dual sided dvd , with archives of patches , movies , free games , demoes , hardware guides ... . not to mention the fact that there are many highly intelligent articles every month . in case you 're still feeling sceptical : the uk version of pc gamer was the original . it came to the us after it was set up in the uk . having lavished the uk pc gamer with praise , i think you can read between the lines and figure out where the us version falls short
mag	where are all of my magazine subscription first issues ? ? ? ? ? ? ? mar
mag	i am a serious foodie that loves to cook and is always looking for new ways to shake up the meals that i prepare for my family . the beauty of `` gourmet '' is that they do not concentrate on the cuisine of one culture . i also appreciate that they provide articles on both the best methods , and on quick methods and dishes . i have read `` gourmet '' off and on for at least 20 years . the magazine has changed somewhat during that time . the focus has shifted to more of a lifestyle magazine than a pure cooking magazine . the features of the june 2006 edition are as follows : tiki time : a collection of polynesian food and drink we are family : recipes for a summer party a greece less traveled : northwestern greece travel and recipes in the section , seasonal kitchen , there is a very well done article on salads . the roasted vegetable panzanella is fantastic . in the gourmet everyday section , i always enjoy the three regular articles : quick kitchen ( 30 minutes meals ) , five ingredients , and 10 minute mains . these are always tasty and usually all quick . if you are a foodie , and/or you want to be this magazine is a nice starting point . i would suggest that you pick up a couple of issues on the newsstand to confirm that this magazine is for you before subscribing . i highly recommend this magazine for budding home chefs .
mag	i had always suspected and recently found out that elle uses a different kind of ( at least ) paper for the cover of the editions it mails to us subscribers . while the elle magazines in bookstores , supermarket etc . have thick , glossy , high quality paper for their covers , the managazines i received in my mailbox has a dull and thin cover . i guess the company wanted to cut cost , because to remain competitve , they were forced to offer subscribers a deep discount . still , it 's cheating
mag	these puzzles keep me sane during my all to frequent short-hop airline flights in which there is not enough time to open up the laptop
mag	i thought , eh , lucky magazine , i do n't really need this anymore ... so i broke it off . ( i am a college student , so , i 'm a little bit poor . lol . ) i was wrong . i love lucky . i know fashion and trends are kind of an `` air head '' market , but i 'm going to subscribe again because : a . ) i am a design student , and fashion and trends are chock full of design elements b . ) i subscribe to newsweek and i watch the news all the time . it is depressing , lucky is not . c. ) after coming home from a long day of classes and work , it 's not so bad to want to read something with lots of pretty pictures , is it ? ( the answer is no , that is not bad . ) lucky rocks . seriously . if you want something that 's fun to read and fun to look at it 's great . i do n't recommend it for people who are in deep credit card debt becasue they just had to have the latest designer handbag , becuase this will get you into trouble . for everyone else , who just wants to look hip ... or just plain sytled . lucky is a great magazine
mag	what is the national enquirer , you ask ? it 's a phony as hell newspaper that provides all the latest gossip about celebirties but they come up with fake stories half the time . avoid it like the plague
mag	more and more , all the industry wants to do is tell you what it is you are supposed to like , and ridicule anything we might consider to be a guilty pleasure , and if you indulge in such a thing , you are 'shallow ' . music has evolved past this attitude , and no one believes in this naked emperor anymore . and oh yeah , their politics is so mixed up , they do n't even know what they believe anymore . i was a subscriber for eleven years , my renewal notice came , and i could n't come up with one good reason to send it in
mag	first off , i subscribed to this magazine for a couple of years , and enjoyed it . but the `` main guy '' robert kennedy , is someone who offends me both personally and politically . he assumes that every girl/women reading that magazine is tiny . for his information , some of us work out 5-6 days a week and eat well , and are still heavy-set . his comments on heavy-set people are offensive , thoughtless , and sometimes even downright cruel . nonetheless , the pictures/articles were inspiring to me , and it is a decent fitness magazine
mag	i have subscribed to this magazine for almost a year now and i have become very skeptical of much of its advice . this advice seems to be heavily influenced by its paying advertisers e.g . the us dairy industry ( there is always at least one of those annoying `` got milk '' ads ) and not surprisingly , every issue there are several articles in the magazine that hype the supposed benefits of a diet high in dairy products ( e.g . milk and cheese ) . however having read many books on nutrition , it has become very clear to me that that the majority of current research shows that a diet high in dairy products can actually be very damaging to your health - for instance read the the china study by colin campbell , an extremely comprehensive nutritional study that sheds a great deal of light on the us dairy industry and its shady methods of influencing the public 's perception of the healthfulness of its products . it is well known that there are many better ways of getting calcium etc into your diet than by dairy but this magazine is unfortunately blinded by its advertisers ' paychecks . the magazine also appears to be very similar to prevention magazine which i also have subscribed to and i would make the same criticism of . my advice is to stick to reliable sources on health like the excellent `` berkeley wellness letter '' that are not supported or influenced by the advertisements of drugs companies or powerful industry groups like the us dairy industry
mag	i got this as a freebie along with w and it lasted only as long as i received it for one year . the use of fur and skins was nauseating and i could n't have been more disgusted at the vapid , innocuous , 'insights ' it offered . this magazine has no redeeming social value .
mag	ladies home journal has several features that readers will like . one of the most popular is `` can this marriage be saved '' featuring a couple that is having marital problems presenting both their sides and then a counselor 's advise . other columns include `` how they met '' , `` animal affairs '' , and `` raising a family '' . each month there is an article featuring a family that acquired a house through habitat . a nice feature is a column presenting a man 's perspective called `` heart of a husband '' . there are also articles on beauty , health , travel , and parenting . there are plenty of recipes and craft and decorating ideas . each issue also includes a couple of celebrity interviews . i highly recommend subscribing to ladies home journal , you wo n't be disappointed !
mag	if you are into high brow interior design then this is for you . but my problem is not so much with the magazine as it is about their customer service at veranda and the subscription department 's ability to read . they are by far the worst
mag	it seemed like there were 2 articles 80 pages of advertisements
mag	i am completely frustrated and upset with the delivery , or lack thereof , of the magazine subscription i received as a gift of romantic homes . this is my absolute favorite magazine and my husband purchased a year 's subcription for me from amazon.com for christmas 2005 ! i still have n't received one magazine ( it 's now july 2006 ) . amazon assured me three times , over the past year , it was coming , it 's now july and i still have n't received the magazine . i am so disappointed at the lack of customer service . i urge you to never buy a magazine subscription from amazon.com . this has been a horrible experience and i can not believe that it has somehow become okay to run a business in this matter . i am tired of empty promises from amazon.com while i am anxiously awaiting my magazine . not only have i not received my magazine , the `` people '' at amazon have never offered a refund , a renewed subscription , anything ! i realize it 's a measly twenty-something dollars , but this business practice is horrible ! i am also tired of speaking to people that do not speak english and are trying to help me . please do better amazon , this is terrible ! shame on you !
mag	this magazine is sweet it features tons of eye candy , being plants and hot girls and buds , lots of great tips , tricks and info on the culture around pot
mag	i wish this magazine came out more often ( as another reviewer said ) . it would be fascinating for anyone with the slightest interest in the history of technology and engineering . recent articles have covered vacuum tubes , their history , and why some are still used now , and nuclear power and how that industry stalled in america . i remember reading another article in the mid-'90s about a guy in new york city who shoveled coal for a public school furnace . he explained his job and how hard it was to buy a coal shovel ( the hardware store people could n't believe it ) . a few years later they followed up with a note that all public schools in nyc had been converted from coal , and that the coal-shoveler 's job was much easier maintaining the new furnace . stories on iron bridges and how necco wafers are made ( with the same machine for 100 years or so ) and how buttons are made from seashells and how paper clips are made and how a hollywood actress designed a frequency-jumping weapons guidance system and all sorts of others are included . lots of cool articles about how everyday ( and not-so-common ) technologies went from ideas in someone 's mind to products that are ready for use
mag	i remember , not quite four years ago , when this magazine actually had pc substance and catered to a sophisticated pc-oriented market . now , it 's thin , hollow , interminably off-topic and ad-choked .
mag	this is an excellent magazine but i would have saved $ 7.00 on an annual subscription by buying it with the enclosed postcard rather than through amazon . also i have to wait 12 weeks to receive the first issue ! ! my bad
mag	in my humble opinion , this is the best magazine for style and fashion advice . even the advertisements are hip and informative , in terms of fashion and style . of all the style magazines out there today , this is far and away the best of the best .
mag	playboy magazine , while luring people to open the cover with promises of female flesh , consistently has excellent articles focusing on issues of civil rights , civil liberties , and the defense of them all . trancending partisanship , playboy is a beacon of stewardship over the rights we all take for granted daily . and the pictures are nice
mag	ordered 11/27 - never received a single copy . not very fast is it ? slow company may be a better description . can i have my money back
mag	great magazine ... .my favorite ! ! ! ! if you dont like the price here , go to uncuts home site and subscribe at about $ 7 per issue
mag	fangoria has always been the first rate magazine for horror movie freaks . nothing else comes close : if you 're in love with horror movies look no further-this mag has been out for over twenty years
mag	this is a great magazine , but do n't order it through amazon . they go through a third party ( snapse magazine ) that has terrible customer service . i ordered this magazine in january and six months later ... still no magazine . i called snapse twice and was told they had no record of the order ( even though i received an email confirmation from amazon and i have a 17 digit confirmation number ) . they said they would research it and get back to me . no one called or emailed me the status , so two weeks later i called them again . they acted as if i had just placed the order and told me it takes 6 to 8 weeks to receive the first issue . i wo n't get my first issue until august . buyer beware ... it could take seven months before you receive your first issue .
mag	from fitting pants to making origami pants , there is always something for the sewer to learn and enjoy . threads used to have good knitting articles , but decided to abandon the subject to concentrate on sewing . if you are a fashion sewer , this is a must-have
mag	a real favorite in this magazine is the page of quotes , it is sure to bring a smile or teach you something about life . they also always have cleaning tips , health topics , diet and exercise solutions , true stories , beauty hints , inspirational articles , soul nourishing tips , recipes , recipes and more recipes , family/children , flowers , end of the magazine article to make you think about life , and gardening hints . if you want to find a cover story fast , they have an `` on our cover '' section in the index . in every issue there is a shopper 's guide and a recipe index . the articles are helpful and in the march 2002 issue they had an article on how to be less stressed . they also had an article on pcos which is apparently more common than we women think . the beauty sections show you the newest fashion and you can decide if you want to adapt your style to the trends . always seems rather chic . some of the recipes in the march 2002 issue included : a luscious lemon coconut pound cake coconut macaroons peanut butter oat bars baby cheesecakes - really cute banana salsa french oven beef stew pasta with shrimp the recipes are not difficult and seem practical . even the advertising in this magazine is colorful and fun . a very `` american gal '' type magazine . nothing fancy , just real life . ~therebeccareview.com
mag	i have more animals than i know , i love best my gang of dogs , and this mag . has it all products , reviews , vet info , wonderful storie
mag	i read this at stop and shop each month , hoping it 'll get better . each month i hope desperately for some pertinent , relevant , or just plain mildly useful business hints and tips ... and they are just not forthcoming . for someone who is interested in making millions with vending machines , look no further . always longed to invest in one of those mlm ( multi-level marketing ) ventures that start their pleas with : `` dear friend , i was once a loser like you . thanks to this company , i 've turned my life around ! what are you waiting for ? just send me all your money and you could be as tanned and successful as i am . '' ? then this is your mag ! for a business owner who is looking for some serious help ? do n't bother ! you 'd be far better off with a subscription to american venture or something in that line
mag	great magazine . published out of the uk . excellent features and great bits of trivia . my favorite sections are cash for questions ( readers send artists questions and win cash ) -someone asked lou reed if he really performed heroin for a conference of psychiatrists and won 25 pounds , now ( new artists ) , instant karma `` where pop and philosophy meet '' . also great music reviews , more than 200 in each issue of a wide variety of music genres . but what they do really well are lists -top 100 albums ever , the 90 best albums of the 90 's etc ... my favorite being `` when rock stars go crazy - the 100 greatest acts of rock'n'roll folly '' - no.1 being michael jackson statue sails down the thames ( river in london
mag	this magazine is all puff -- if you 're looking for honest and insightful reviews , this is not your read . however , if you already know all the artists they profile and just like pretty pictures of them , this magazine is worth buying for the sampler disc included with every issue
mag	during the 1960 's , when my sister subscribed to ahmm , the stories mirrored the fantastic television show ; the stories were primarily mysterious , creepy , and unique , with lots of murders and the twist endings that made the show so great . now , the majority of the stories in the magazine are plain , uninteresting `` detective '' stories . i subscribed up until about the early 1980 's , but stopped because of the same old boring `` cops and robbers '' material . i tried to read a recent copy while waiting for my aunt at the beauty shop , but switched to one of the media rags instead when discovered that ahmm had n't changed . subscribe only if you are a fan of pure `` police '' fiction
mag	if you 're in search of a magazine for women that actually has worthwhile content then move on . there is nothing of substance in cosmopolitan . open the latest issue and you will find `` sex tips that will drive your man crazy ! ! ! '' and `` snag that cutie ! ! '' galore . it 's pathetic . and sophomoric . the sad thing is young women purchase magazines like this and want to emulate the fake lifestyles within that revolve around a ) looking for your `` one true love '' and by default b ) how to achieve multiple orgasms with random sexual partners/boyfriends whilst on said search ! and let 's not forget inane question and answer spreads . those are a hoot with such inquires as `` my crack gets really itchy . what should i do ? '' no , this magazine is not my bible . this is another publication that deserves to be thrown into a furnace
mag	even if this magazine is a mag-a-log , what would we do without it ? september issue rocks with eva mendes on the cover and some juicy fall finds inside . the biggest news ? lucky has found a way to shop with your cell while stuck in traffic . it 's about time technology got up with our lifestyle
mag	i am a serious foodie that loves to cook and is always looking for new ways to shake up the meals that i prepare for my family . the beauty of `` gourmet '' is that they do not concentrate on the cuisine of one culture . i also appreciate that they provide articles on both the best methods , and on quick methods and dishes . i have read `` gourmet '' off and on for at least 20 years . the magazine has changed somewhat during that time . the focus has shifted to more of a lifestyle magazine than a pure cooking magazine . the features of the june 2006 edition are as follows : tiki time : a collection of polynesian food and drink we are family : recipes for a summer party a greece less traveled : northwestern greece travel and recipes in the section , seasonal kitchen , there is a very well done article on salads . the roasted vegetable panzanella is fantastic . in the gourmet everyday section , i always enjoy the three regular articles : quick kitchen ( 30 minutes meals ) , five ingredients , and 10 minute mains . these are always tasty and usually all quick . if you are a foodie , and/or you want to be this magazine is a nice starting point . i would suggest that you pick up a couple of issues on the newsstand to confirm that this magazine is for you before subscribing . i highly recommend this magazine for budding home chefs .
mag	house and garden is a no-holds barred celebration of great *design* , primarily of interiors -- and to a lesser extent `` gardens '' and exteriors -- but also of product and architecture , with a smattering of coverage dedicated to artistans , travel , wine , and music . there is a spirit of high playfulness and arch but subtle , airy sensuality pervading h ... seems to me it 's published by artistic souls for artistic souls ... if you want pedantic , safe , predictable , go for traditional home , house beautiful , even martha stewart 's living or one of the other , more mainstream magazines . while it 's true that not all of the issues are standouts -- the issues published around the end-of year holidays are generally thin and somewhat wan compared to the spring and fall issues , when staff are doubtless away on vacations and content must undoubtedy suffer -- overall house garden hits it out of the park more often than not . like domino , it 's newer , younger cousin in the field of `` shelter magazines '' , it breathes the fresh air up there -- up above the cluttered field of clone publications which all proscribe the same cookie cutter `` look '' for homes -- and succeeds beautifully . h is a real little monthly armchair primer on what 's new and noteworthy in the field of residential design and related topics ... blissfully free of tiresome , ubiquitous celebrity coverage ( the recent cover article on jade jagger notwithstanding ) . even the font -- a clean , stylish art deco -- nods towards the knowing . highly recommended !
mag	my subscription was for a year . but the subscription office stopped sending the magazines even before the subscription expired . i would suggest people subscribe to good housekeeping directly instead
mag	i do not who to contact on this problem but i have as of yet to recieve a magazine yet . i kow it is to take awhile but i have recieved other order of a different magazine i placed
mag	nice replacement for my oprah magazine . like the concise and to the point articles . good suggestions sprinkled in magazine . very heavy with the advertisements ... but then the ads rip out quickly , leaving a more simple real simple read .
mag	anyone with a good taste in music will hate this magazine , as it only rates bad bands from bad genres good reviews and whatever good bands are listed , are often given bad reviews . its all pretentious pop-culture drivel for the conformist , weak-willed mainstream american . the worst part of rolling stone is the 100 greatest guitarists of all time list ; as they highly rate kirk hammett , kurt cobain , and tom morello ( all extremely overrated guitarists ) while rating eddie van halen at a very lowly # 70 and not even mentioning these awesome guitarists ; kerry king/jeff hanneman ( slayer ) , john petrucci ( dream theater ) , trey azagthoth/erik rutan ( morbid angel ) , jeff loomis ( nevermore ) , steve vai , and joe satriani . if you know anything about good guitarists , those eight guitarists i just mentioned destroy kirk , kurt , and tom . do n't read this if you 're trying to decide what good music is , you decide what good music is . think for yourself , do n't let mtv and rolling stone think for you
mag	i subscribe to inc.. although i am not a business owner , yet , i find the articles to be informative and the magazine a useful resource . as an accomplished song writer and aspiring song seller , the article on ( ... ) -may 2005- made me aware of a resource that i did know was available . check that one out . with joe mansueto , ceo of morningstar and self-confessed fan of inc. , acquiring the magazine i can only imagine the great things ahead . the full-page n.y. times ad reinforces mansueto 's commitment to growing the brand . ca n't wait for future issues
mag	this was kind of an impulse buy for me and i did n't get what i thought i would get . i thought it would be a clear and concise magazine on what is up and coming in tv and the movies . instead i got indepth ramblings on actors and directors . if you want to pick up a magazine and find out what is coming up without fluff and filler ... this is not the mag for you .
mag	this magazine is just one more reason why women think that men are immature , stupid , and boring . the magazine does nothing but highlight and impress upon the superficial tendancies of men and in its so-called news coverage gives short details of events and people that does n't even begin to scratch the surface of good taste . do n't bother
mag	i wish i could give this magazine 6 stars . finally , an honest magazine for christians . i am the target demographic , so i understand the style does not appeal to all , but the content can easily relate to anyone who is willing to get past their pre-concieved religious notions and desire biblical truth . i sometimes get sick of the 'relevant ' move because it frequently becomes used as an excuse for christians to abuse their freedom as believers , but relevant does a fantastic job of giving a balanced look at relevant faith . i do n't always agree with every article , but i appreciate the open , honest , and sometimes opposing views . it is not a one-sided , or single minded publication . i wish i could afford to get a subscription for all the christians i know
mag	i flip through time every now and again at the barber shop . sometimes there are good bits that they are using to keep the interest of people who want progressive social change , people who are sick of the power of the corporate elite and the violence of our militarists . for the most part , since time receives most of its revenues from big business advertisements , it ca n't challenge the establishment as it needs to . so instead i read magazines like z , utne , mother jones , the progressive , the sun , earth island and the new internationalist
mag	this is probably the best music/movie magazine out today . however , you can go to borders books or barnes and nobles and get it for $ 8.95 or something . this deal is bs
mag	an anti-catholic newspaper in a catholic town ( this peculiar quality of the paper existed long before the priest-child sex abuse scandal in the area ) . whether you are a catholic or not the paper 's anti-catholic bias makes one wonder why it has such an ax to grind and wonder too if the paper does not hold other prejudices . its `` factual reporting '' often times reads more like editorials . it has elitist pretensions without the quality to back them up . i live in the boston area and am exasperated with the globe . i prefer reading the new york times
mag	i bought the magazin on november , and i do n't recive it yet
mag	i 've been a loyal subscriber since 1998 and have always enjoyed the magazine . something happened to them in early 2006 - they 've either been bought or have hired a new editor / staff or something . this magazine is absolutely terrible now . all ads , fewer and fewer pictures of babes in each issue , and the hilarious articles are now long gone . my last two issues ( sept and oct ) were in the trash within minutes of pulling them from my mailbox . i 'm canceling my subscription .
mag	many of us who have contibuted years of creative expertise to our field feel quite insulted by publications of this sort that attempt to `` take a ride '' on the creativity of others . my advice : do not purchase , read , or advertise in this third-rate publication . there is little more credibility or validity than watching `` jerry springer '' . please , do not embarass yourself or your clients ! save this one for the bottom of the cat box only
mag	where 's the content in this magazine . ads ... ads ... ads . they try and make themselves out to be a great golf travel magazine , but i have seen much better in other publications . i agree with the woman from england ... links loads up on these inserts . i like to read a magazine like the golfer , where they travel all over the world and review spectacular courses from the carribbean to new zealand
mag	i looked at intermezzo in a bookstore , and my husband purchased a subscription for us because it looked like a great cooking magazine . beware , beware , beware ! i received a total of 2 magazines and repeated promises that others were on the way . r. tully is great about responding to emails . it 's a shame the magazine does n't show up as promptly , if at all . i recommend cooking light . it is a fantastic magazine with lovely recipes and incredible customer service . they replace missing issues and do everything in their power to make the customer happy
mag	it has been several weeks and still no magazine from money ! ! ! ! oh yeah but they did remember to bill my credit card in a timely fashion ... .maybe when something takes over a month you should bill the person when u ship the product ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
mag	i have been a subscriber for a few years and have found alot of the articles repetitive and not all that educational . recently i have subscribed to shutterbug which is a much better magazine for both the novice and professional photographer . its articles are insightful and even after many years they still can teach this old photographer a few new tricks ! ! ! !
mag	so i ordered the magazine in nov. 6 , 2005 . its now feb. 22nd , 2006 and the magazines ( since i also ordered the smithsonian and scientific american ) are nowhere to be seen . of course , my account was quickly charged and at this pace , i 'm guessing the whole genomic structure of all living organisms in this planet will be decoded before i receive any of them ... so if you actually want to read this excellent magazine , it might be a better idea to get somewhere else..
mag	i should preface this reveiw with the fact that i am an accomplished home cook . i have been cooking for 25 years and own more than 500 cookbooks . i do not buy commercially prepared products like breads , crackers , mayonnaise or salad dressings . i make these items myself . i suspect that i am not the target audience for this publication . the may/june 2006 issue is 32 pages in length in total . given that there are only 6 issues a year , i was expecting a little more than a mere 32 pages . the may/june 2006 issue contains the following information : simplifying moroccan chicken bringing home fish and chips grilled tomato salsa grilled london broil main-dish vegetable stir-fries how to cook pasta foolproof veal scaloppini a new twist on chicken salads garlic and olive oil mashed potatoes utimate turtle brownies best strawberry cream cake the scoop on vanilla ice cream a review of tongs if you are an experienced cook their is n't much about cooking in this issue that will be new to you . this issue contained not a single piece of new information for me about cooking . however , i enjoyed the equipment reveiws and did find them informative and useful . this magazine would be helpful if someone is an inexperienced cook . bottom line , i will not be renewing my subscription unless future issues have a little `` more meat '' in their content . i think that this magazine is overpriced for what you receive . i would suggest saving the price of the subscription and buy their `` best of '' cookbook instead . it costs about the same amount , contains many more recipes , has many of their equipment reviews and is bound in a hard cover so that it will hold up longer . additionally , check out an issue of `` fine cooking '' which is another test kitchen type of publication , just with more depth .
mag	i ordered the magizine subsribtion and when i ordered they told me it would take up to 6 weeks , so i went out and bought that months issue . a few weeks later that issue came , which is understandable but they had sent me the previous month before that . i hadnt even ordered my subsription that month .
mag	despite its controversial past , i 've subscribed for years and enjoy this magazine a lot . definately a lot of good articles
mag	was a subsciber for many years mainly due to extremely balanced reporting , indepth coverage , etc . then , starting about 1-2 years ago , the magazine started to take a `` left '' tilt . ( i do not consider myself `` right wing '' , am registered as an independant , but do like fair balanced coverage in my news ) since the beginning of this decline , the atlantic has become more and more just another liberal magazine . the bias has also led , as it always does , to less in-depth reporting , since they tend to now ignore any aspect of an issue that does not support the left bent .
mag	at one time , southern living was truly a source in our family for cooking ideas . over the past few years , it has become a collection of new things to do with canned and boxed food , in a sad attempt to re-arrange the same old thing for people who do not know how to cook . only the christmas book seems to actually embrace cooking now . we can not speak to its information on gardening , just the cooking part . if it were not my mother 's habit of reading southern living , we would have cancelled this long ago . if you are a serious cook , get the cookbooks from years ago . the current magazine is well beneath you
mag	a lot of reviewers share similar views , as seen in the recurrence of similar criticism of today 's magazines . what these complaints also have in common is that they can tend to be fairly uninformed in regard to certain issues . first off , we all know that t+l is for `` affluent travelers . '' read the publisher 's description , and it will tell you just that . so if you 're not an affluent traveler , then do n't waste your money on t+l and stick to budget travel . t+l occassionally has `` affordable '' stories , especially in their affordable issue in march . but do n't expect the hotels to be to be under $ 200 a night . you know why ? because nowadays under $ 200 a night means you 're a step above a youth hostal , especially in europe where you pay an extra 20 % on top of every dollar with today 's exchange rate . the point is that t+l never positioned itself as an affordable travel mag , so to criticize its shortcomings in that respect is an invalid complaint . anyone who claims the photography is blown out and out of focus has n't picked up a copy of the magazine since 1999 . furthermore , if all you saw were straightforward photographs of hotel rooms , you 'd go out of your mind with boredom . there 's nothing wrong with adding a little art to your photography , after all photography is in fact art , and t+l does a pretty good job of that . and so what if there 's a beautiful woman in the photo . no one 's saying you have to look like her or promising that she 'll be strewn across the bed in your hotel room . use your imagination - this is travel photography in travel + leisure magazine - it ai n't newsweek . and with all of the other offensive problems with media today , only in america do people complain about too much skin . lastly , readers need to understand that magazines do n't put in more ads for giggles . a magazine is a business , and ad revenue is the way a magazine earns money . so the more ads they have , the more profit they have , the more money they have to pay better photographers and writers and hire more staff and do more research , etc , etc , etc . no magazine is going to choose to throw away money in order to not offend its readers with fewer ad pages . in fact , high ad content is an indication of a high circulation , which is an indication of reader satisfaction . the more people a magazine reaches , the more companies want to advertise there . the fact of the matter is that there is no perfect travel magazine in existence . they are either too service heavy , or editorial fluff , or too scientific and adventure-y , or just a b-level publication . t+l has its shortcomings , it has its top whatever lists and there 's a lot of high-end service in there . but it 's stunning and has its share of well written and interesting articles
mag	my kids love highlights ! it 's applicable to both of their age ranges ( 6 and 9 ) and is a valuable investment for any parent . i do n't know what i would do without this magazine ; it keeps them entertained at restaurants and while we travel in the car . not to mention , it 's much cheaper than investing in portable gadgets that are out of date every few months .
mag	a playground for the mind . covers a wide range of subjects . each review is a full essay on the subject of the book . many reviews compare and contrast several recently published books on the same subject . learned and sophisticated yet fully accessible . an on-going liberal arts education and the easiest way i know to keep the eclectic learning that a liberal arts education aspires to
mag	i have had the subscription for 2.5 years now and i enjoy getting it bimonthly . the recipes often do call for hard to find ingrediants ( since i do n't live in a real big city ) and most of them take alot of prep time and cooking but that 's why the magazine is cooking pleasures . it 's not quick 'n easy . i gave the magazine 4 stars instead of 5 because i find that most of the recipes are `` pleasurable '' in comfort and not calories or fat . i love the desserts and main dishes they usually have , its just that most of the dishes are not good for the waist line . but , i guess that 's why its pleasures and not light
mag	truly this is the magazine of the warmongers , the neocons , who would gladly repopulate america completely with non-europeans , except for the neocons themselves and their cohorts , who are of `` a race of the mind , '' as one wag put it , by and large . pro-war and anti-american people ( and certainly anti- euro-american people ) , this magazine is truly one to be boycotted . if you are an american of european descent the american conservative will more likely be for you . if you are racially aware and do n't wish to see your people vanish from the earth , i would also recommend the occidental quarterly . to give the devil his due , tws does carry some interesting book reviews at times . if you love your people , as long as they are not from `` the race of the mind , '' do not buy this magazine , and if you already subscribe do the smart thing and cancel for a refund , as i did a few days ago . highly recommended as antidotes to this warmongering propaganda are two outstanding collections , neo-conned ! and neo-conned again
mag	the high price is predominately due to the shipping costs as this magazine is produced in the united kingdom . a subscription over there runs about twenty bucks . however , even with the added expense to get this delivered stateside , icreate is a great looking magazine with excellent editorials . top-notch magazine and highly recommended . just wish imagine publishing would recognize the potential of this product and start producing this , as-well-as a few other of their excellent magazines , here in the states
mag	i just received my first order , and i love it ! this magazine covers a broad range of topics and includes designer techniques , current trends , period styles and so much more . it has tons of vibrant pictures to illustrate the articles . i think this magazine would be ideal for someone just starting out in design to gain a basic understanding on a wide range of topics , and also for the experienced designer to keep up with current trends and fill in the gaps with knowledgeable tidbits
mag	i read this at stop and shop each month , hoping it 'll get better . each month i hope desperately for some pertinent , relevant , or just plain mildly useful business hints and tips ... and they are just not forthcoming . for someone who is interested in making millions with vending machines , look no further . always longed to invest in one of those mlm ( multi-level marketing ) ventures that start their pleas with : `` dear friend , i was once a loser like you . thanks to this company , i 've turned my life around ! what are you waiting for ? just send me all your money and you could be as tanned and successful as i am . '' ? then this is your mag ! for a business owner who is looking for some serious help ? do n't bother ! you 'd be far better off with a subscription to american venture or something in that line
mag	outdoor photographer is the essential how-to and where-to magazine for the outdoor photographer . i would recommend it for all levels of photographic skill , although most discussions of technique are suited to intermediate to advanced skill levels . there is only occasional discussion of the most basic techniques , as would benefit beginners . there are , however , so many great ideas on where and what to photograph that i think beginners can get a lot out of the magazine as well . and you wo n't be a beginner for long . the `` outdoor '' in the title does not refer exclusively to nature photography . most of the magazine is dedicated to nature photography , but there are frequent articles on travel , location , and other sorts of outdoor photography , as well . in outdoor photographer you will find how-to articles on lighting , exposure , filters , gear , preparing yourself and your gear for the elements -be they arctic cold or rain forest heat and humidity , along with some advice specifically for digital cameras and the digital darkroom . and you will find this information for everything from close-up to landscape photography . outdoor photographer focuses primarily on 35 mm and digital photography , with an occasional article on medium format . the discussions of exposure , lighting and locations are applicable to all formats of photography , however . and there is george lepp 's monthly question and answer column for those questions on just about any photographic or digital imaging subject that are not answered elsewhere . and now for the best part . outdoor photographer tells you where to get great outdoor photographs . `` favorite places '' is a one-page feature in every issue that tells you about a great place in the united states to photograph , what there is to see , and what time of the year is best . be sure to save those in case you ever have the time and means to visit them all . in addition to `` favorite places '' there are featured articles in every issue that detail a place to photograph , how to get there , what to take , what to photograph , etc. , frequently written by well-known nature photographers and accompanied by some of their terrific photographs . i counted 3 such articles in the last issue of op that i received . if you are a photographer or hobbiest who is able to travel a lot , outdoor photographer is a terrific bargain just for the locations . and if you do n't travel much , it will help you photograph your backyard and local parks and gardens well
mag	they may have some good info , but i was flipping through this in my local bookstore , and most of what they have is a whole lotta ads ... and within the ads a lot of scams and mlm schemes . buyer beware . :
mag	i am a new subscriber , have received two issues so far . this is a fascinating magazine , beautifully laid out , and well written . in the first issue i received ( which i have now read almost cover-to-cover , something i never do with magazines ) , there were articles about dog rescue in asia , the science of the historical relationship between dogs and their humans , emotional vignettes about the love between dogs and humans and so much more . i like the reviewer who likened this magazine to the new yorker about dogs . the first issue was chock-full of everything from useful tips to weepy stories to fascinating science . i made an effort to cancel all of my magazine subscriptions recently , simply because i do not have the time to read them all . this one will remain . in fact , i may start archiving this magazine-it is that good ! all of our guests inevitable pick up the magazine , drawn by the crisp graphics , and retained by a healthy variety of reading . obviously , i am a fan . i have barely started the second issue , but from skimming the articles , i have full faith that i will not be disappointed . subscribe and enjoy
mag	i have n't received this product yet and i 'm pretty upset about it . i 've requested that someone contact me about this problem and i have n't been given an answer . i think i 'm deserving of some sort of discount or at least an answer . where is the product i bought ? ? ?
mag	bought this as a girft for my mother , and she loves reading them . must be really good
mag	yes , ew has changed over the years , but i believe it 's as relevent now as it 's ever been . the articles are interesting and the reviews usually right on the mark . i read it cover to cover .
mag	if you really love sports , there is no finer magazine than si . the breadth and depth of the coverage is unequalled by any other mag . the pics are the best on earth . the writing is tops . sign me up for another 24 months
mag	time has long been increasingly superficial in its news coverage , and recent years have only accelerated this trend . in the 60s and 70s , it was a somewhat serious magazine with a centrist bend ( originally it was considered quite conservative ) , but as the years go by it 's degenerated into more and more pop-culture fluff with little substance . as for its being part of the `` liberal '' media , this is inaccurate . recent coverage of the ( 2004 ) election has attempted to reduce the democratic candidate to the status of a non-person . the first debate between john kerry and george w. bush was not even covered , except for one very brief article listing a few `` fact check '' points . instead , the cover story wa about new products and movies , a kind of sharper image catalog lite . time also gave no coverage whatsoever to the election in afghanistan . it was mentioned in passing in another article about the u.s. election , but i would imagine that conservatives would object to the magazine 's ignoring a signficant world event that george w. bush has pointed to as one of his accomplishments in office . in my view neither candidate received adequate and fair treatment . the bias seems to be in favor of mr. bush , but it 's still mostly bland and superficial . your money is better spent on the british magazine `` the economist '' which is far more substantive . while its editorial viewpoint is conservative , it 's sound fiscal conservatism rather than the tent-revivalism that currently substitutes for conservatism in u.s. politics . `` the economist '' also provides a liberal viewpoint and is the closest i 've found to a ( dare i say it ) fair-and-balanced approach to the news . time can still be entertaining to read , but i would n't take what they say too seriously . they tend to bend with the political wind
mag	one of the funniest magazines around . in a recent article , the weekly standard proposed massively expanding the irs to help pay for the massive debt and budget deficit . which group did the `` weekly standard '' say should be targeted for this increased irs presence ( and massive increase in tax rate - for some 100 % ) ? the entertainment industry . the reality tv show contestants , the teen-pop singers and the like . the article noted that normally massive taxation would hurt an industry , but with all the people that really want fame , that go all out to get their 15 minutes of fame , the industry would continue along ( i 'm curious if o'rourke realizes that the tax would be applied to similar writers ) . another o'rourke article provided the readers with an alternate inaugural address by bush ( subtitle : `` what if george w. bush were n't a compassionate conservative . . . `` ; quote : `` the media say that i won the election on the strength of moral values . if the other fellow had become president , would the media have said that he won the election on the strength of immoral values ? '' ) . in all seriousness , this magazine is a very clear detailed neo-conservative look at the issues ( neo-con ? - interestingly , it would appear that many of the writers used to be liberals ) . the magazine does not always present just the conservative perspective , and does not always agree with bush . another recent article was by a current liberal , ex-communist british writer and his reaction to george galloway 's testimony before the us senate . an editorial in that recent issue was all about the dictator in uzbekistan , an us ally in the war on terror . the editorial notes that toleration of this dictator and his brutality will undermine bush 's current foreign policy . it should be noted that the magazine does not seem to have journalists , and few staff writers , most appear to be called `` contributing editors . '' it is jarring , though , when i read the magazine then read articles in some of my other subscriptions . `` variety '' and `` weekly standard '' rarely agree . for that matter , i 'm somewhat surprised by how often the `` weekly standard '' and `` business week '' disagree . - michael s. briggs -
mag	he was very happy with the product and i was happy as to how fast he has received his product .
mag	the title speaks for itself . i do n't know how or why i was drawn to this magazine when i was 14 . this magazine should be called j-4tweens . ah . the title is very annoying . like twist , i only get this magazine when i 'm really really desperate for something to read . i sure as hell would n't want my 12 year old daughter to wear mascara . if you have a tween and you want her to grow to become a pimpstress , get this . the only entertaining aspect of this magazine is the embarassing moments kinds of things ( but of course ) . other than that , no . they feature pretty bland fashion . all in all , this magazine is just like twist . therefore , the age reccomendation is just 11 12 , but you 're better off getting gl for even more years worth of goodness ( 10-15 yrs . ) because no , it 's not cool to steal your sister 's damn boyfriend for pete 's sake
mag	this magazine covers every aspect of horror/suspense culture , such as comics , books , music and of course , movies . the writers of the articles have respect for the craft involved in the subject , and do n't just dwell on blood and gore ( but have no fear , there is plenty of that ) . whoever designs the layout of this magazine does a beautiful job . lots of glossy photos and intriguing artwork , too . give this one a try . i 'll bet you 'll love it as much as i do
mag	the magazine is great ! the problem is , i am not receiving them . i ordered a subscription in january and have received 3 issues only ! ! ! all my other orders with amazon have been received , i have no idea what is happening with my magazine subscription . i wrote to amazon to ask if there was a way of tracking my order but have n't gotten a response
mag	this is the one only cooking/food magazine to buy . not only does it share fabulous recipes that are tested in the magazine 's test kitchens , it also illustrates step-by-step instruction , rates cooking tools gadgets , educates the reader on seasonal ingredients
mag	i subscribed to cooks magazine some years ago , back when it began publishing again . i had problems with issues that failed to arrive , and wrote to them about it - never received a reply or any note of concern . since that time , i occasionally glance through it at newsstands to see if there are any articles of interest . even by dint of casual glance , i 've begun to tire of the formulaic articles in which some drone tirelessly adds or deletes ingredients in order to finally come up with the `` perfect recipe '' for something or other . i now skip right to the `` perfected '' recipe , and decide whether its worth committing to memory . some of the explanations for the success or lack thereof of the inclusion or exclusion of a particular ingredient are hare-brained at best . there are also two other areas of this magazine that have disappointed me : 1 . product reviews : they range from just plain wrong to idiotic . the kitchenaid pro 600 was hailed by cook 's as the best in its class for many mixing chores . yet , the amazon reviews tell a different tale - one of a short lifespan when used to mix bread dough because of a plastic gear cover that deforms and finally comes apart , allowing the metal gears to separate . christopher kimball ( the editor ) once performed an evaluation of cookware in which he calculated the price of the cookware per pound of its weight . no , i 'm not joking . in that evaluation , le creuset came out on top simply because it was heavy . all-clad , even though it conducts heat very evenly , suffered for not having as much heft , and therefore was judged pricey , on a pound weight basis . one issue of cooks boasted on its cover `` unsweetened chocolate -supermarket brand beats others '' . apparently , hershey 's was designated best . not too many months later , callebaut was recommended above all others , and hershey 's was judged barely acceptable . feeling manipulated yet ? 2 . finally , there are those dreadful editorials by mr. kimball . rambling , painfully written , and punctuated with a picture of mr. kimball wearing a bow tie , and looking very much as if his head were being held on by it . mr. kimball is a humble man , with much to be humble about . he writes as if he were chanelling helen gurley brown , but in red and black flannel watch-plaid and without her sense of play . time to re-vamp this magazine , folks
mag	years ago 'the sporting news ' was the fans ' 'bible ' . i can remember what a special feeling it gave to look at it , the real lowdown , the most bottom- line stuff , more statistics than even the greatest baseball nut could ever remember . i no longer really follow the game , or any of the games as i once did . and most of the figures even the names of the players are strange to me now . i picture in my mind my uncle the late broadway abe freedman who lived his life to see the yankees lose , picking up this paper and cursing at some columnist proclaiming the yankees the favorites to take it all in the coming year . that coming year and so many coming years are already gone . but there will be a next year , a next season , another sporting news ' and someone somewhere in america devouring those numbers as if they were crackers jack and cold beer at the seventh- inning stretch .
mag	i am really liking this magazine already because it focuses particularly on multicultural and biracial marriages , brides , grooms , weddings , everything ! this mag focuses on brides of every color and overall just average brides in general . there is focus on how to incorporate dierent heritages into the details of the wedding from the gown to the reception . i also really enjoyed the little feature on biracial celebrity pairs and of course the gorgeous ring and gown spreads ! i definitely recommend this magazine if you are in a biracial relationship , blending two cultures into one wedding ( or both ! ) , or maybe you just want tips or ideas so you can plan a unique around the world cross cultural wedding just for fun . if an all white wedding is not for you in more ways than one than this is the magazine to pick up
mag	this is one of the worse magazines i have picked up in years . if you have `` money to burn '' traveling , then it might be for you . loaded with advertising and little 'true ' content
mag	this is one of my favorite magazines ! it has a little bit of everything , and i love the do 's and do n't 's section too . its aimed for 20 and 30 something women . i ca n't miss a month of it
mag	i ordered this mag back in june , now it 's december and i 've yet to receive it . this equals a big fat zero in my book .
mag	i 've subscribed to opm for four years now , and in that time i 've never had any subscription or delivery problems . the writing staff is very intimate with their readers ; it 's almost like reading a magazine that a bunch of your friends wrote up . the reviews have mostly been spot-on for my tastes ( compared to the awful , laughable insanity of psm ) , and even though the ziff-davis crew members are `` official , '' they are fair . also , and this is very , very important to me , their use of the english language does not suck like it does in psm . the staff at psm seem to be drunk most of the time , or maybe they just did n't make it through the second grade , i 'm not sure - but their mishandling of prose is the main reason i dropped that subscription like a hot potato . opm on the other hand seems to be written by college grads at least , and i appreciate that . easy to read , filled with thoughtful insight , fair reviews , and a heaping helping of socially balanced humor , opm is bar-none the best playstation magazine you can buy
mag	i wanted more recipes and this magazine has too much other junk in it . will not renew , not what i wanted
mag	i love eating well ! i am an active weight watchers member and was so disapointed in the weight watchers magazine , then i saw eating well and subscribed immediately ! it is the best food magazine out there and no ads
mag	i know it takes eight weeks and maybe longer but i do appreciate the information that i 've gained from store bought `` maximum pc '' magazines . i do n't build computers but when i do order one , it is nice to be familier with the workings and attributes of the new computer . yes ... you can find much information on-line and generally faster than the amount of time it takes for the magazine to reach your mailbox , however , is great to kick back away from the computer in your favorite chair and 'read ' about it : ) a very good magazine ... but 'adult ' language used at times does not appear to me as professional use of the english language . thus the 4 rather than five stars
mag	! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! dont buy ! ! ! ! nuff sai
mag	this mag is for people who think they are computer experts because they can change out a video card or follow directions on changing an os setting . shallow coverage , and some of the lamest humor you will ever come across . it is nothing more then a rehash of what is freely and easily available on the internet . there is nothing original in this mag , ever . also it tends to copy and paste much of the issue from 12 months earlier . all the main articles are nearly the same every 12 months . do n't believe me ? take two magazines that are 12 months apart and compare them . the reviews are also weak . nearly every month you will see : the fastest system we ever tested ! ! ! ! ! yaaaaawwwwwwnnnnn . who cares ? anyone who knows even the slightest about computers knows that speed is not the most important attribute , even for gamers . besides , does it really matter that system y is .00005 % faster on their poor testing system then computer z ? the second star is for mr halfhills column . it is the only part that is consistantly interesting and the only person there with real technical know-how . read toms hardware and whatever tech news you want , learn how to use search engines , and skip this pointless mag
mag	i love this magazine ! i love how the main message is `` be yourself ! '' it has no advertizments and it does n't say you have to be beautiful to be happy . i 'm really tom-boy , and alot of other magazines make you feel like `` normal '' girls are obsessed with iming , fashion , makeup , and boys ! i hate those magazines ! read `` a total sucker ! ! ! ! '' another review of this magazine , it says that `` normal '' teenage girls , have crushes , and hate to be out of style ! am i like that ? no way ! this magazine is just right , it has probably 1 true artical about that stuff , but it 's not really flirty or something ! get this magazine !
mag	i subscribed to this magazine for useful tips i could use for my own children . not only did i find that helpful , i have also used the information to apply to my high school classes . thank you for the wonderful ideas
mag	q magazine is a brilliant magazine laden with british humor , bonus cds , special edition magazines , and more . being a fan , i bought the led zeppelin special edition issue , and it was more complete than any novel ! it was about 150 pages and contained full-color pictures , info on each album , concert , experience , myth , book , review and bootleg imaginable . when critiqueing an album , they used the opinions of others and the band members as well as their own . this magazine cares-rather than gushing , ranting , or offering biased opinions , it gives the impartial truth about bands-new and old
mag	i bought this magazine as a gift subscription for my sister in law . she raved over it so much i bought it for myself and wow . it is a great magazine . we generally read it cover to cover . it is truly what it claims to be- a magazine about family fun . there is a section on rating or planning family vacations . we could do without this one section but even then it is well written and interesting . other sections include family games , outdoor games , theme parties , crafts , and more . kids cooking recipes , how other families solved problems , toy book and software reviews and even more . it is jam packed with fun things to do . many of the kids things are directed towards children who are about 8 . however , my children who are younger than 8 enjoy many of the things here and look forward to the magazine so they can find new things to try . my niece who is older than 8 still enjoys the activities in this magazine too . this is a great gift for a teacher or a person who has children .
mag	what a beautiful magazine ( full color pictures on glossy paper ) , and what interesting stories behind each food . the recipes are sometimes doable , although most of the time i just like to read about the exotic ingredients in each . a must have- makes the living room look very sophisticated
mag	how people can read and be fooled by the nonsense sprouted in ths rag is beyond me . all the usual suspects are found through out it 's pages . this rag represents all those things that leftists are now notorious for : polictal correctness , anti-capitalists , anti-gobalisers etc with all these -isms and ologies your in for a pain in the head . what 's more the 'ideas ' you 'll find here have been tried , tested and more importantly failed . ah well ... some people are just too easy to fool
mag	had great expectations , for the expensive subscription you get some really great coverage of neat hardware hacking stuff happening out there ( and available on the web ) . the how to make stuff takes many many unnecessary pages , get the feel that they are trying to fill the pages with large photo spreads . still has a way to go before it becomes a successful combination of wired magazine , elektor electronics , and hardware hack websites . would definitely like more stuff like making an xyz mill/router instead of a feature on the mit fab lab . in spite of all the above i have renewed the pricey subscription - am still hoping ...
mag	despite its name , this mag is n't just for brainy types . anybody who 's interested in knowing more quirky , fascinating things about the world around them -- presented in a highly readable , humorous style -- will find 'mental_floss ' a fun read . interested in the weird history of hackers ? ever wanted to know how to grow your own organs or wrestle an alligator ? all written by your smart , funny friend from college -- or so the mag 's super-accessible style will have you thinking . a definite recommend
mag	i am a time person of the year 2003 ( shared title - actively deployed u.s. servicemembers ) . i must say that reading time magazine is like reading the platform for the democratic party . actually it is even worse than that it is like reading john dean 's diary , filled more with fantasy and personal wishes than actual reality . one of the latest from the online edition is that realists have taken over washington . give me a break . a new set of hogs have come in to take over at the troff and that is it . anyone who believes nancy pelosi and her gang of political hacks is going to help america is a fool . best thing we can hope for is that they create so much gridlock that no one can spend any money in washington . maybe then they will see that america improves on its own and politicians on both side make things awful . the sad thing is that people that read this publication actually think they walk away knowing something about the world . this publication is so biased that it not only misinforms its readers it makes them look like fools when they try to repeat what they have `` learned '' . if you want a truly useful weekly news publication then subscribe to the economist . it probably will not change your political affiliations but it will at least make you sound competent when you debate others . the economist is quite simply the best weekly news magazine in existence . the articles are well written by people that know what they are talking about . leaders from around the world read and contribute to the economist . this is something that time , newsweek and the rest of their ilk can not claim . i am not affiliated with any political parties and do not consider myself political . i look at things from an economic perspective and vote accordingly
mag	gq , a.k.a gentlemen 's quarterly is a men 's magazine like cosmopolitan is to women . gq has a broad range of contents in it 's magazine from : in-depth articles from movie and rock stars , fashion , food and drink , technology , movies , music , etc . the magazine gives equal attention to all the contents except fashion which is more abundant throughout the magazines pages . all in all , gq is a great men 's magazine with plenty of fashion news/tips , and also delves in other men 's interests as stated above

mag	stupid that for bad supply side business i havent gotten the magazine and wont get it for at least another month and yet i am asked to write a review for it . boo amazon wheres my magazine
mag	do not order . they only placed an order for 7 months but i got billed for 12 . after 3 hours on the phone they said that 7 months was all the publisher had available and they cannnot extend it . after pitching a fit they offerred to give me a partial refund but can not extend the subscription . only order from the magazine itself
mag	i certainly do hope one of these days that maxim magazing will get women who are small-breasted equal time . that 's all i have to say
mag	in christmas of 2005 i decided i wanted the most interesting and best cooking magazines out there . but which ones to pick ? after buying one here and there i found three that i absolutely love . saveur was one . the recipes are nice though some i would n't touch with a ten foot pole ( ethnic ingredients that do n't appeal to me ) . but the stories and the pictures ... they are n't just amazing , they 're astounding ! where national geographic talks about certain things or places , saveur takes you to different places and shows you what 's there and how they eat . they showed me ireland and i even made colcannon ( a mashed potato and cabbage dish ) everyone loved it . i made a french dish last night that was amazing . it was a little time consuming but worth it ! i do have admit i was a little disappointed with my first issue i received from them with my subscription . it looked like a dog ate it then ran through the water with it . it 's readable but i was n't happy . they also promise two exclusive magazines for new subscribers . i 've never seen them . but i have been getting my magazines and they look good . i was thinking about it the other night , my three magazines i picked ... one was articles and recipes about healthy eating ( eating well ) , one was easier recipes with no articles ( everyday food ) , and then saveur . if i could only pick one to keep ... it would be saveur . it 's really that good of a read .
mag	regardless of the quality of the magazine , it is really annoying to see oprah on every single cover ! and to make it worst , she does not pick `` regular oprah shots '' , instead you look at every issue 's front cover and ask yourself `` how did they take that picture ? she does n't even look like her ! '' it 's as if oprah is telling all of us `` see how i can look like ? '' every month is just a new testimony from oprah , that money does do wonders . on the top of that , oprah 's personal thoughts , things , favorites , ideas , even more pictures are all over the few pages that are not advertisement . i still gave it 2 stars because from time to time you can find a good article , but the bottom line is the question : is this a magazine or a show off ?
mag	i 'd been a long-time fan to vibe since they been out . i 'member i first lay eyes on em by checking the covers on 'em but not reading by 'em . y'know . they such knockouts . yeah they definitely keepin ' it real no matter what . i believe they 'll be around more and more since them magazines u read all the time like essence , ebony and jet . i still have love for them also . but to say vibe does n't suck . i 'd never been a subscriber since last year and i definitely enjoy it to this day . i actually read the xxl and source magazine most often now . same w/ upscale , campus life , just to name others . i luv they magazine to death man , knahmsayin . ya 'll keep it rocked y'heard . nobody 's bringin ' the hype on ya fellaz . keep it up ! !
mag	as with any profession or avocation or just down right fun habit , it is only as good as the tools you use . this magazine helps you keep up with the latest in the knitting world while still offering traditional patterns and methods . there are lots of glossy shots of fibers and models with well defined patterns and suggestions . you can find many great ads and reviews of other reading material .
mag	vanity fair is a highly recommended monthly magazine for people who enjoy reading . packed with lengthy articles , gorgeous photography and blurby information , it never fails to entertain the reader . it is the perfect companion for a lazy afternoon at the beach or on quiet plane ride across country . the vanity fair forumla is simple : slap a photo of a celebrity on the cover and inside offer a wide variety of articles , including hollywood puff pieces , domenick dunne 's true crime accounts , in-depth articles about international scandals , christopher hitchens essays and profiles of colorful , unknown characters . though this formula has changed little since the magazine was revived in the 1980s by its now legendary editrix tina brown , the magazine 's new editor , canadian-born graydon carter , has succeeded in putting his own personal stamp on vanity fair . in virtually every issue carter uses his letter from the editor to bash us president bush . though i do not begrudge carter his right to speak his mind , after months of reading carter 's criticism , i get bored with these relentless rants . still i highly recommend a vanity fair subcription to anyone who enjoys reading . -- regina mcmenami
mag	this is the only music magazine you ever need to read . this is what rolling stone should aspire to be . there is really nothing more to say than if you like music this is all there is
mag	detailed articles , and interesting columns . balanced , and not afraid to be critical where appropriate .
mag	i 'm a big player of pc games , but i also love reading and thinking about my favorite hobby . for the past few years i 've been living in the uk , but when i come to the us ( and now that i live here again ) i would pick up the american version of pc gamer . i have to say , and i hope some of you take my word on this , the u.k. publication is light-years ahead of this one . the humour is grown-up ( not to mention actually funny ) and does n't drown the magazine . it 's bigger , the cover and pages are of much better quality paper and ink , the articles are neatly laid out ... added to this , the demo disc is a jam-packed dual sided dvd , with archives of patches , movies , free games , demoes , hardware guides ... . not to mention the fact that there are many highly intelligent articles every month . in case you 're still feeling sceptical : the uk version of pc gamer was the original . it came to the us after it was set up in the uk . having lavished the uk pc gamer with praise , i think you can read between the lines and figure out where the us version falls short
mag	it took four months to arrive and by then i was moving ...
mag	i am a loyal , long time fan of empire magazine and have collected almost every issue from no.1 . being a british mag , it differentiates itself from others like premiere and entertainment weekly by it 's frank dissection of all movies , and provides a wide range of opinion and discussion . i will always read empire , and if you like movies , you should too .
mag	i 'll let others argue whether or not the quality of the magazine has subsided over the years . i , for one , still get something out of the writing . ca n't do without my monthly dose of harper 's and the atlantic . what i would like to point out is that why would you buy here when the subscriptions cost less on a.m. 's own website
mag	i am a regular u.s. reader of other future publishing art titles , and was overjoyed to see the first title on the newsstand of this fantastic magazine . imaginefx explores the digital science fiction , fantasy and anime genres through letters , interviews , portfolio expositions and fantastic tutorials . all issues also include pull-out artwork by the featured artist , as well as a companion dvd featuring files for the tutorials , artwork and software . within the magazines pages one will find a wide assortment of styles and artists , including everything from tutorials by noted conceptual artist ryan church to explorations of gothic art by several fantastic artists which all serve to expand your creativity and help you along your own creative path . on the minus side , most of us u.s. readers will be put off by the per-issue pricetag . but for those living in the u.k . ( lucky ! ) or those u.s. readers willing and able to part with the money , this magazine is not to be missed
mag	forbes is a great magazine . amazon on the other hand , well they ought to get out of the magazine business . order said first issue would be in february . amazon `` forgot '' , to place the order until i called in april to find out what happened . now they claim the first issue will be june 19 . yeah right . funny how they do n't forget to charge the credit card you place the order . do n't order magazines from amazon
mag	i subscribed to modern bride as a gift to my fiance . aside from not receiving our first issue until 3 months after the subscription , i only received about 3 issues total . months went by without anything being delivered . while customer service at modern bride was very accomodating and helpful , nothing happens immediately . when planning a wedding , each and every month is precious . especially during the initial stages of wedding planning . to have finally gotten this subscription problem under control was exhausting . plus , by this time most of the wedding details were finalized , the magazines i received became useless . if you 're under 12 months to your wedding date , you should strongly consider if now is a good time to begin a subscription with modern bride
mag	rue morgue is a true horror magazine . you get countless articles on upcoming , recent , and past horror with interviews from writers , directors , stars , and more . there 's always tons of reviews on everything from theatrical horror to festival horror to those silly straight to video horrors . crave more horror on the 'net , then rue morgue is always giving you your fill on websites . and what i 've always found to be an awesome thing about rue morgue ... there 's always full page ads of upcoming horror movies which serve as mini-posters , and they 're glossy paged . rue morgue , you just slashed into my heart and did it right
mag	great magazine . covers the full range of .net technologies . every issue is packed with windows , web , and xml development articles plus industry news and a lot more . high recomended
mag	first off , i usually just stick to rating critiquing movies . but , every time i see an ad on this website for this time/warner ( or whatever the hell the company calls itself this week ) rag-mag i start to see red . `` entertainment weekly '' , which was once an interesting weekly deluge from the ho-hum of everyday life , has become just another rag crapped out weekly to stand on newstands week after week prostituting for your hard earned cash . back in the summer of 89 , `` ew '' was released and after i read a few issues , i decided to subscribe . i was instantly hooked ( the new issue would arrive in my mailbox the saturday before it would hit regular newstands ) i liked getting the latest news and reviews from movies , music , t.v. , and video ( that was later added in the mid-90 's ) . the problem with the magazine started in the late 90 's . i started to notice that `` ew '' would cover a big movie or event that had n't yet been released and then the following week bash the hell out of it , or try to get some piece of dirt on it in order to generate more sales . i also hate the damn lists that `` ew '' comes up with . the latest entitled `` the top 100 most memorable movie lines '' was a joke . these lists have always annoyed me , because i feel they are truly not thought out and therefore not thought provoking . the other most important thing i noticed was the absolute lack of an honest review . case in point , a few weeks ago i picked up the latest issue in which the movie `` catwoman '' had been reviewed ( i was n't to sure if it was gleiberman or shwarzbaum that critiqued it ) . i first logged onto `` rotten tomatoes.com '' to see what percentile `` catwoman '' recieved from the nation 's critics . out of roughly 115 reviews `` catwoman '' only got 10 % of the good reviews while the rest trashed it ( a film needs , at least , to get a grade of 60 - 65 % in order to place it as a fresh or good movie ) . that makes `` catwoman '' the worst reviewed film , so far , for 2004 . yet , `` ew '' gave the film a b . what erkes me even more is that `` catwoman '' is released by `` warner bros. '' , the same company that owns the rights to the `` harry potter '' films , `` the lord of the rings '' trilogy , yes , the `` wb '' owns `` entertainment weekly '' . is `` warner bros. '' trying to bribe or threaten its own critics at one of its most popular lucrative magazine 's ? i 'm not the only who has seen this developement . people have written in saying that there is favoritism among `` warner '' products that are reviewed in the magazine . `` ew '' , of course , hotly denies anything of the kind thumping there chests and standing behind there reviews , possibly in fear of being fired ( they will deny that also ) . my only question to the reviewers at `` entertainment weekly '' is , `` whats it like to stand in your own pile of bull**it ? '' or better yet , `` what 's it like to stand on a democratic podium ? ''
mag	i purchaced this magazine thinking that it would be the next step from the amateur photo magazine level to the serious pro level . in fact , it is not really either .
mag	as an interior design student , i find this magazine a wonderful source of inspiration , variety , and creativity . this magazine is more about art and design than advice on `` do it yourself '' decorating or cheap furniture finds , so : do not subscribe to this if you are expecting the latter or else you will be sorely disappointed and become one of the reviewers who give one-two star reviews here because they had expected this magazine to have a different , more practical purpose
mag	harper 's bazaar is a pretty decent fashion magazine , but i wish now that i had never gotten a subscription . true , each issue would be more expensive , but 1 ) i could pick out what issues seemed worth buying , as some are thin and empty 2 ) they are quite often late with their delivery or you miss an issue . i have only gotten one issue on time , to be honest .
mag	all you manager types . you know who you are you read 'who moved the cheese ' and jesus ceo , this is the mag for you lame , trite and oh so self importen
mag	this is a great magazine with the exception of articles written by herb glossberger , who seems to only write articles about the people at la lifting club ( where he works out ) . if you overlook that aspect , the mag is great . the knowledge that can be gained simply by reading the articles written by louie simmons and dave tate . well worth it . it also can not be purchased in your local magazine store
mag	logic problems really helped me prepare for college . many of my courses required critical thinking and writing . when i first started doing logic problems , i was terrible ! they were so hard , but as i practiced , i became adept at solving these problems . i thought of them as `` mental push-ups '' . the effort was worth it ! i graduated magna cum laude
mag	lucky magazine makes me feel not so lucky . it makes me sad that i can not afford all the items they put in their magazine . one month they tell me round-toed shoes are in and show me 50 pictures of shoes that i would love to own of which 2 i can afford . then the following month lucky tells me round-toed shoes are out and square-toed shoes are in and show me another 50 pictures . you get the idea ? this magazine is based on trends and you will be broke if you try to keep up and feel bad if you ca n't afford all the great things it is showing . i did enjoy lucky for it 's profiles on upcoming designers , some great website links , and the one or two affordable items it does toss in each section . i also got a few ideas on how to wear clothing in new and different ways . most of the time , though , i felt sad and envious after i finished reading it . these are feelings i 'd rather not encounter . i think i would enjoy it more if it were more informative discussing the quality differences in the items they are showing , maybe testing them out in different situations to help me make the best choice in my purchases .
mag	i got a subscription for my father on father 's day , and he really likes it . recommend it
mag	if you want a magazine based on fashion but merged with stories and interviews of top celebrities , then w magazine is perfect for you . this large magazine is not only interesting , but beautiful . it has pages and pages of high quality , remarkable photos . not to mention tons of beautiful fashion ads . if you live for fashion , or if you simply admire it ; you will get latched onto w. celebrities such as kate moss , mary kate olsen lindsay lohan have graced the cover of this magazine . pick it up even if you 're the slighest bit interested . you wo n't be disappointed
mag	for years discover was the best magazine for the lay person or even scientists who wanted to keep track of the trends in other fields of science . now with a new publisher it has become almost worthless . very superficial articles are mixed with over blown headlines and poor science . after buying discover since it 's very inception i find it sad what has happened to this magazine . check the dates and notice the glowing reviews for the old magazine but pay attention to the negative ones from the last 6 months
mag	i cancelled my subscription to this magazine 6 months ago with a letter to the editor stating that i loved to see nude woman , but subscribed to learn from the masters about photography . i can not tell you how disappointed i was when i resubscribed after not taking the magazine for years ... it used to be a wonderful magazine chock full of insightful articles , lighting techniques , studio setup diagrams , lots of great stuff ... i subscribed to a 2 year deal through an online subscriber and asked them to quit sending it after only 6 months and to keep the money . not worth the paper it is printed on- period . apeture i hear is pretty good , and i also hear popular photography has gotten much better and now only 95 % about advertising and product reviews and at least 5 % helpful tips and tricks..
mag	this magazine is almost as bad as consumer reports . their comparison tests never adhere to their thesis about what the tests is measureing , for example a comparison test is said to be about quick acceleration and on point handling and then the car with the lack lust performance in handling and acceleration would be # 1 in ranking . often , the car reviews are always mentioning information about a car that is n't relevant , or does n't make sense , or the review is n't consistent with the posted viehicle stats . the magazine also seems to be biased . some vehicles are criticized with more irrelevant information than others to say its awful . after further reading of many issues , you would think they are playing favortism towards certain brands or recieving kick backs from manufacturers , for example , you will always see the domestic brand being referred to as basically `` trash '' and a japanese brand or a bmw is always the way to go , when once again the posted stats and sometimes photos say different.this is more noticeable when you can predict the out come of their reviews . ultimately , its a bad guide towards getting any information on automobiles period . its the pat robertson of auto magazines . if it were possible , i woudl n't even give this magazine 1 star .
mag	i like this magazine but i like simple scrapbooks better . it seems as though they have the same featured scrapbookers layouts in there all the time ... just from what i 've observed anyway . i like the layouts , they have good ideas , great tips on tools and some good tips on digital scrapbooking
mag	long time loyal cosmopolitan reader rates 5 stars i 've read cosmopolitan and helen gurley brown since the 60 's and never miss a month . along with skads of other magazines i enjoy , cosmopolitan manages to have some fun fashion , fun hip dating articles , fiction and true stories , and lots of quick reading ideas . i 've never thought of it as a `` health '' magazine as another reviewer thought of..it 's been an iconic reading for the early sex in the city set . `` sex and the single girl '' by helen gurley brown was a breakthough book in its day , letting women in the 60 's know that it 's perfectly okay to chose career and other paths in life than the one society forced on the women in that day . cosmopolitan has been the singles bible that confirms that it is okay to be single and thriving and adventurous in your life . i can see where this would irk men that want to repress women , or women that have subdued to their repression , but if that 's not you ... then keep the cosmoplitan 's coming . catch up on some great women and what they 're doing . educate yourself on women 's health issues , find out what men like ... a few tricks..check out the fashion , new make up tricks , and new products , and never stop learning . personally , i plan to read it forever . there 's something for everyone in it . and it has inspired me for decades . thank you , cosmopolitan
mag	forget about shop etc ... lucky is the best shopping mag by far . i got alot of coupons for full size products an , samples inside of lucky magazine . i love me some free samples ! i am from nyc and you have to know what 's wearing and all , so this mag let me know a whole lot about fashion , makeup , hair produts , house wares etc
mag	`` the wall street journal '' is one of the most-in-depth business journals available . it is an interesting blend of current events and insightful analysis of prevailing and sometimes not so apparent trends . the quality of reporting is generally balanced and professional . although every newspaper has a political orientation of one sort or the other , the wall street journal news reporting is largely free of politics , making it a good source of unbiased news and information for most people . however , its editorial section is conservative , although thankfully the editorial section is a tiny portion of the whole magazine . the journal has a lot of insightful business news that every manager at any level should find useful . the reporters cover the various topics in great detail and with knowledgeable perspective from all sides . they are not afraid to cover corporate transgression with rigour and honesty . the journal also covers various other topics such as personal finance , special reports , business profiles , interviews , commentary , market and news of note for management personnel .
mag	what is it with these gossip magazines ? ? please tell me , because i truly think no one in their right mind would ever subscribe to this garbage . all it is is mindless crap that the media puts into kids minds , while not having anything important else in the magazine . unless your 10 years old , do not subscribe to this . there are better magazines out there fortunately , like seventeen and cosmogirl ! which are n't nearly as filled with garbage like this . the reason you do n't see j-14 or this magazine or any other magazine like this on the top of the magazine list is because it has no effect on people , it 's for little kids and it 's not mature . period .
mag	2 months after ordering , i have year to get my first issue . i 'm sure i 'll like it ... if i ever get it
mag	this is a tabloid , so most likely the stories you 're reading are not true . why would someone spend there hard earned money on a magazine that prints alot of unfounded rumors that alot times turns out to be just that , a rumor
mag	i 've been playing video games since my atari 2600 ( and my lucky neighbors calicovision ) and i 'm happy to say that someone who grew up around the same time decided to start a magazine . at play they go out of their way to show games that they think are great but that are never going to get any press anywhere else . also , since the mid-1990 's i 've been into anime but have only been able to go by word of mouth or more recently by what i see on tv ( thank you anime and cartoon network ) . now i have play to read , as it has extensive , 20-30 pages of quality anime reviews . the reviewers are more than competent and may actually posses brains , unlike the reviewers in most other game magazines . they realize that their reader is not only the thirteen year old grand-theft , tony hawk player but also people like me who need humor and intelligence in my reading material . finally , the quality of printing and lamination on the pages will make you want to keep each one forever and i have reread and consulted past issues over and over . thank you play for giving me something other than bills to pull out of my mail box .
mag	kiplinger 's personal finance magazine fits right in the middle between the lowest-common denominator approach of money magazine and the head-in-the-clouds attitude at worth magazine . kiplinger 's has a nicely balanced style and tone ; it never preaches , and i almost always find a tip , suggestion , or tax-saving idea that pays for my year 's subscription in every single issue . if that 's the measure of the value of a personal finance magazine , then kiplinger 's personal finance magazine deserves a five-star rating . good stuff , and a good value
mag	i 'll get to the point ... if you are looking to stay abreast of what 's going on in popular music , including the indie scene , the americana world and the major elders still around , this is as far as you need to go . the quality of the writing , be it an in-depth article ( many of which are excellent ) or a short review ( you can expect about 200 per issue ) is consistently high . furthermore , i have been introduced to many great bands that do n't even show up in any domestic magazine 's radar , although -ironically- many of these bands are american . so , if you ca n't believe that best it gets is spin or , much worse , rolling stone ( how did it ever got to the low point of having jessica simpson on the cover ... yikes ! ) , you will be immensely rewarded by trying uncut . tip : you can get any single issue at b & amp ; n , borders or tower records for the same amount , that way if you do n't like it you wo n't have to mourn 100 bucks
mag	i picked up an issue of this magazine last week because i wanted to take the picture of the cover girl into my hair dresser . after i got it home , i opened it up to check it out and discovered it is the most brainless magazine i have ever seen . the articles read like something from `` teen beat '' , yet it 's filled with adult material . there were about 10 articles on `` how to please your man '' and `` what guys like '' and even a `` sex workout '' . these articles did n't contain any `` real '' advice -- just unintelligent babble . for instance , did any of you know that guys do n't like it when you act unenthusiastic during sex ? hmmm , crazy . anyway , i do n't see how anyone over the age of 16 could find any of this stimulating , and yet there are too many articles about one-night stands for anyone under 18 to read . but if you 're still into taking quizzes and looking at `` half-naked hunks '' who have barely hit puberty , then this magazine is perfect . i would have given this magazine 0 stars , but unfortunately it 's not an option
mag	many years ago i subscribed to bird talk for my cockatiel that i had for 25 years . recently i purchased a new green cheek conure and wanted to learn more information about the caring and raising of a conure and birds in general . i started last july y subscription to bird talk and read everything . it is an excellent source of information for every current and possible new bird owner . each and very issue is a pleasure to read and i highly recommend it to everyone
mag	the articles are `` good '' but the articles are wordy and doesnt get to the point . too many annoying ads . if u want something to `` read '' this isnt the magazine for yo
mag	i 'm sure that this review is n't unique . spin rotates the same ten bands on its cover , not to mention the ridiculous articles written within . by the time they get done describing the 'euro-punk-indie-pop artist that just slammed them in the face on their way to the train station with their jazzed up sound ' i 've completely forgotten the point of thier article . they must have the greatest time just sitting around finding how many contradictory adjectives they can tag onto useless music and still manage to say nothing . they sound like cyber-nerds who need to get out a little more and stop getting thier info from mtv.com . i 'm sure that i 've learned more about what thier editors do in the office on any given day than anything remotely close to music while reading spin . next time you see it on the stands , i suggest you spin in another direction
mag	this is the only political magazine i will read . it is a great read if one is a conservative , but someone with liberal ideas may not care for it
mag	one of my favorite magazines ! i would'nt live w/ out it ! thanx ! artchalet @ msn.co
mag	i had always suspected and recently found out that elle uses a different kind of ( at least ) paper for the cover of the editions it mails to us subscribers . while the elle magazines in bookstores , supermarket etc . have thick , glossy , high quality paper for their covers , the managazines i received in my mailbox has a dull and thin cover . i guess the company wanted to cut cost , because to remain competitve , they were forced to offer subscribers a deep discount . still , it 's cheating
mag	please read naomi jakobs ' review for relevant magazine below . it captures so brilliantly and eloquently the heart of the christian 'post-modern ' kick . if you have to go out of your way to claim you 're a celebrity , then you simply are n't a celebrity ( take `` fitness celebrity '' john basedow for example ) . in the same way , if you have go out of your way to claim that the post-modern evangelical movement is relevant , then you 're claim for relevancy is simply not credible . the christian church has certainly played a vastly significant role in the past 2000 years . however pop-culturalizing evangelical christianity is n't causing it to be any more relevant than it was when sandi patty or carmen ruled the christian top 40 . does the fact that some christians enjoy the latest musical fads make the concept of accepting a human blood-sacrifice for the pardon of sins more palatable
mag	internanatial artists magazine is the best magazine on the shelf bar none . i 've read many other artist magazines time and time again , but have n't found anything that compares to this jewel . it provides great illustrations as well as wonderful perspectives that are enjoyable as well as inspiring for your reading pleasure . not only does it inform , it also provides technical and creative details and images in various media for most artist needs in bold beatiful color . this is a truly a winner
mag	i have n't received this product yet and i 'm pretty upset about it . i 've requested that someone contact me about this problem and i have n't been given an answer . i think i 'm deserving of some sort of discount or at least an answer . where is the product i bought ? ? ?
mag	i ordered and paid in full ( through amazon ) for a gift subscription to vogue kitting last christmas , 2005 . the recipient never received a single issue and was treated very poorly when she phoned to inquire on more than on occasion . it is a quarterly publication but no longer seems to be consistently offered on news stands in major bookstores . read the policy regarding refunds and cancellations carefully before you give them your money ! the content of the magazine may be worthwhile but their inability to deliver as promised and poor customer service earn them one star
mag	lucky is one of my frequent checkout pickups . bright , fun , and not requiring any frontal lobe interference , it 's the perfect pick-me-up for the early morning commuter train . i give it five fabulous stars ! however , the actual subscription was very underhanded ! within the space of a week i was sent last month 's issue ( long gone from the stands ) , the issue just about to decirculate , and , finally , the actual current issue . so , two weeks after my order i am already 3 issues in to a 12 issue subscription , and none too happy about it . condï¿½ nast needs to be told that subscribers do not exist to let them clear out their unsold backlog
mag	was very dissapponted with this magazine . they go unread and get thrown out . just waiting for our subscription to run out . it is really for older kids and of very little interest to younger kids
mag	this magizine has the latest star scoop and the coolest stories sentin by reader
mag	if you 've read one `` cosmo '' , you 've read them all . do yourself a favor and check out `` glamour '' and `` self '' - you 'll walk away happy , inspired , and hunting down the mailman for the next month 's issue
mag	the wine spectator is one of those magazines designed to reassure you that you 're rich or that you soon could be , all in the context of a shared love for the fruit of the vine . there 's lots of deadly serious material in this glossy , pleasing publication . but if you 're a lover of wine who is *not* rich - the category includes this reviewer - you need to learn to take it with a sense of humor . just enjoy the game . that game includes a travelogue of the world 's wine regions as well as the possibility of gaining a decent education via month-by-month reading in viticulture and wine appreciation itself . this reader is in it for the long haul - i hope to enjoy good wine at an affordable cost for the duration of this earthly slog - and the wine spectator is my companion along the way . my job takes me out for many dinners in various parts of the world that include wine-splendored places like france , south africa , chile , argentina , australia , new zealand and - of course - northern california . but with wineries now in 49 of the usa 's fifty states , what 's *not* a wine region these days ? on those business treks , i find myself out for dinner as often as not . it 's personally satisfying to know just enough to order a pinotage in capetown , since only south africa produces this varietal , or to opt for one of argentina 's persuasive malbecs because they 're just *that* good . we 're not talking wine snobbery here , just satisfaction at the margins of life 's all too margin-less journeys . if this sounds like your game , the wine spectator may be a worthwhile investment . even if not , consider splitting a subscription with a colleague . that 's what i do . at half the price , i get a fine magazine and avoid burdening my bookshelves with one more heavy , beautiful , pleasant magazine . life can deal you worse
mag	too often in america we are fed news by deceiving journalists ( such as those that work for fox news ) . the economist offers news with an agenda that does not always correspond to america 's . it is a great resource for furthering ones knowledge of the world , from politics to economics to science to the arts . best of all , the articles ( except for the special report ) are concise , allowing for an easy read .
mag	here are the great things about this magazine subscription 1. the unbeatable price , metal edge is $ 36 and it sucks 2 . it has very interesting articles , artists tattoos a bunch more 3.free music downloads ! ! ! overall this is an awesome magazine , beating metal edge and hit parader into the ground . unlike the other rock mags here you do n't see mainstream bands like slipknot on every other page , it cover the lesser known bands too . the picture and paper quality is excellent . again subscribe now ! !
mag	i hope i get program to receive it next month patty jone
mag	i 'm a subscriber to road track , car and driver , and motor trend . simply put , r is the one i look forward to the most each month . if you 're looking for a well-rounded auto magazine , this is it . in r you 'll find : -road tests and first drives . -an excellent `` ampersand '' monthly feature with all the latest info on future cars and prototypes . -news about the latest races and drivers . -top-notch photography and art . -witty columnists . ( see side glances by peter egan ) -the occasional technology-related feature . -classic cars , classic drivers , classic tracks . the best historical content in the business . -very little content on suvs . ( a positive in my book ) the competitors : car and driver has substantially more road tests and previews , and some good specialty features on a pretty regular basis , but hardly anything on racing and history . frankly , motor trend is n't anything to write home about . the articles are shorter and less captivating , they ca n't seem to settle on a design theme , and they also have a lack of racing and historical content . if i had to pick just one , road track would definitely be my choice .
mag	how 's j-lo doing ? are jennifer and brad pitt still together ? what are the olsen twins up to ? is orlando bloom a hottie or what ? ? well ... who the hell cares ? ? ? i got better things to care about than some news about these celebrities -- people i 've never actually met , let alone `` know . '' please , teenagers should be steered away from this kind of worthless , trashy magazine ( other examples include seventeen , ym , teen people , and the list goes on ) . there are other issues which happen to be more important , you know . try national geographic or the new yorker instead . the newspapers are also good
mag	i love this magazine mainly because i am a figure and fitness competitor . it has great tips . if you are not competitor and just love to workout , this magazine is for you , too ! you will get motivated by every article and meal plans ! i do not recommend magazine for individuals who are just looking to get toned and not to cut body fat to supreme low levels . oxygen can at times overly advertise the supplements . i used to get shape mag but i did not like the models in that mag . they looked way too small to be advertising fitness . i highly recommend this mag for those individuals are intersted in competitions !
mag	`` spin '' is an accurate name for something like this -- a lot of hype , for an innocuous but rather tepid rock magazine . if rolling stone is the dirty old geezer of rock magazines , then spin is the teenager who tries hard to convince you he 's cool by name-dropping the strokes . spin covers some of the same turf as rolling stone and blender , but less lasciviously -- lots of coverage of popular bands . some of them are quite good -- the hives , for example , or indie newcomer steve burns ( who quit his job on `` blues clues '' after hearing a flaming lips album , and reinvented his life as a rocker ) . unfortunately they overemphasize whatever bands are hot at the moment , and then overemphasize them again -- as well as tacking them up in whatever `` coolest '' / '' best '' lists they chalk up for the year/decade/century/history of rock . indie cred is maintained by a few half-page articles on potentially hot bands like the comas and metric , but this info is halfhearted . it 's like they 're reluctant to tear themselves away from articles on better-known bands , regardless of talent . the writing , however , has that certain affliction that a lot of major rock magazines have : the need to be cool . their writers always are trying to be funny , but rarely come across that way . it seems silly and strained , like a soccer mom wearing a spandex tube dress . even the cd reviews are mediocre . however , one recent highlight is dave eggers ' columns -- witty , funny , and a little bit skewed . in fact , they are often the best things in the entirety of the magazine . one of the problems is the emphasis on stuff in hollywood . scarlett johanssen is a wonderful actress , yes . but she does n't sing , nor has she appeared in a music-based movie -- jack black yes , scarlett no . and what is up with party coverage on tv starlet mischa barton and mtv couples ? check out sublimely indie mags like chord , filter , under the radar and the online kludge for in-depth looks at some worthy bands . as for spin ? it 's still trying to convince us it 's cool , but eggers is the only regularly cool thing about it
mag	you will see for your self why i like this magazine when you bought it & amp ; did you see her big ass
mag	i grew up reading fangoria , when i could sneak it past my parents , that is . fangoria magazine has a total respect for the genere of horror that comes shinning through with every article . now you are not always going to agree with everything they say , but you can always expect them to be honest . when a horror icon is not performing up to snuff , like stephen king or john carpenter , they will be the first to point out the errors and flaws . fangoria also has the chainsaw awards , where you can mail in your vote for best horror movie , actor , ect , and you can also submit a name for horror hall of fame ( my guy has yet to win it ) . they also spot light horror films that would normaly fly under the radar of most people ; like the japanese and italian horrors ( wow , they can make some splatter flicks ) , and more independent films that would n't be showing at the mainstream theater . and they have pictures . all the blood and guts you can imagine in beautiful color ( though they have become more tame compared to what it was in the '80s ) . this is just a great magazine to have if your a horror fan , i whole heartedly recomend it
mag	i love this magazine and have just ordered a subscription for my daughter too . very good value for the money
mag	i absolutely love this magazine ! this is a wonderful read for any who like short stories and mysteries ! the magazine includes new writers as well as more well known ones . a wonderful magazine
mag	i was looking forward to another oprah magazine with great joy . unfortunately , the pomp and circumstance within `` o at home '' 's pages is a real turnoff for me , an average , middle-class american living , as they say in `` middle america '' . although i hesitate to say this in print , it 's been in my head for ahile now . i am a faithful 20-year oprah viewer but something has begun to change in her attitude and it is evidenced in this new magazine . is it possible that oprah has not only forgotten her roots , but has now skipped over all the stages in between her roots and now living in a gazillion-square-foot house in malibu ? is it possible that she has forgotten the 90 % of us who live somewhere in between ? if this magazine is an indication , then sadly , she has
mag	i absolutely love this magazine . i look forward to sitting and enjoying it every month . i only wish it would be a weekly magazine because i ca n't wait for the next edition . i use so many ideas from romantic homes . keep those great ideas coming
mag	harper 's has been in business since 1850 and has published some of the greatest american- writers , from mark twain on down . its editor and tone- setter is the veteran journalist lewis lapham . it publishes fiction , and articles including interesting symposia on many aspects of american economic , political and cultural life . it attracts the big - names in all areas , and also provides a lot of human - interest material , statistical curiosities , historical information and stories . for some reason which i do not fully understand it has never been my great favorite . and in the old days i preferred 'the atlantic ' and the 'saturday review of literature ' to it . of course one of the features of 'harper 's is its book- reviews done by among others today , john leonard . i suppose what has soured me a bit on 'harper 's ' is its bias to the political left . but that withstanding it still provides a rich mix of articles of high quality
mag	this is a great magazine , but do n't order it through amazon . they go through a third party ( snapse magazine ) that has terrible customer service . i ordered this magazine in january and six months later ... still no magazine . i called snapse twice and was told they had no record of the order ( even though i received an email confirmation from amazon and i have a 17 digit confirmation number ) . they said they would research it and get back to me . no one called or emailed me the status , so two weeks later i called them again . they acted as if i had just placed the order and told me it takes 6 to 8 weeks to receive the first issue . i wo n't get my first issue until august . buyer beware ... it could take seven months before you receive your first issue .
mag	the pages of men 's journal used to be an escapist weekend getaway in themselves . they brought you to extreme parts of the globe with a literary style that disappeared after 9/11 . since that time , mj has concentrated on telling its readers who their heros should be , which might have been fine for one issue . this is a magazine badly in need of a new editor and old ideas
mag	we never receive the zoo books , so i am not sure how they are illustrated . my son is very disappointed . i hope no one else orders from zoo books , and if you have i hope you have not had the same problems as us . i have never had any problems with any of the merchants from amazon.com . hopefully since i never receive the magazine as promise after emails and phone calls to them , they can at least reimburse us for the purchase amount
mag	if you want a magazine based on fashion but merged with stories and interviews of top celebrities , then w magazine is perfect for you . this large magazine is not only interesting , but beautiful . it has pages and pages of high quality , remarkable photos . not to mention tons of beautiful fashion ads . if you live for fashion , or if you simply admire it ; you will get latched onto w. celebrities such as kate moss , mary kate olsen lindsay lohan have graced the cover of this magazine . pick it up even if you 're the slighest bit interested . you wo n't be disappointed
mag	this is one of the bibles for anyone in graphic design , advertising , illustration or photograhy . it digs deep into industry trends , features portfolios of upcoming industry stars , and is a must for anyone who takes their craft seriously . while the issues are great , their regional design annual is the must-buy issue every year . it really lets you know who the cream of the crop are . just flipping through it will make you better at what you do ( and you 'll even stop using hackneyed phrases like `` cream of the crop '' )
mag	i find the woman 's day magazine a helpful source of information for myself , my family and my friends . as i go through the articles and information in the magazine , i note items of interest for my husband and i ( we are retired seniors ) , and for my daughter who has two children . since the news that my son and his wife are expecting , i also save information for them . i have tried some of the recipes and were very pleased . thank you for putting out such a great magazine
mag	i love this magazine , the images are crisp , the writing consistantly to quality and the photography is always fabulous . let 's face it when a magazine coins a phrase , you know it 's good . i have read gq for several years and have found it consistantly good , though i must confess the only part that i consider must read every month is style guy , i do n't always agree with him , but i love the questions , you really wonder if these people have ever picked up the magazine the are writing to..one never knows . the clothes they feature are usually top shelf , uh with top shelf prices as well..i mean a $ 2000 pair of alligator lofers..you got ta love it . if you have any interest in the latest styles and some great writing as well , then i highly recommend this book to you , though frankly i ca n't imagine anyone reading this that does not already have an opinion of this iconic magazine..but if you do n't then by all means pick it up and form your own opinion..it 's worth the effort
mag	i remember back in the middle '90s this magazine was think ... probably anywhere between 1.5-2.5 inches ... it contained ads , reviews , supplier lists , benchmarks and sometimes trial software ... well i have picked one up sense them ... and they are now a centimeter thick ( if your lucky ) they contain ... reviews that are well written or well read , and a whole lot of ads ... my conclusion do n't buy it ... if you want reviews buy pc magizine or pc world ... and if you want ads ... surf the internet
mag	saveur has been a guilty pleasure for me for some time . guilty because it is hard to take serious a magazine with such a hoity sounding name ... and admittedly some of the travel-and-food stories are just on the edge of self-indulgent , self-concious behaviour . they laugh at me at home ( or used to ) for reading it . what makes it good is the content . the cover story each issue is usually a `` destination '' article , focused on a particular area and its food ( cuisine is the wrong word here ) , written in a personal vein , with beautiful photos , and this is the heart of the magazine . but the other content is equally beautiful and it is amazing how many of the recipes actually are useful and have become mainstays for me ... not just something good looking . hide the cover if you must , but i think this is the best `` foodie '' magazine
mag	i can not review this item because a month later , i still have not received the first issue of my subscription . sorry frank caldero
mag	the company is taking for ever to send me the magazines i ordered . they has charged my account over 3 months ago and not yet deliver a single copy of its magazines . when i call the company they dont have a number to call or a way they can be accounted for their wrong doing . iwant my magazines or my money back not any more sory we are sendingt it to you ... .
mag	after reading a review here mentioning subscription issues i went directly to american artists web site and ordered a subscription . that was november 23 , 2005 and now feb. 10 , 2006 still no magazine . when i finally complained i got a request to send my credit info again to vnu @ espcomp.com . ca n't say from looking at that address that i have confidence i was communicating with american artist or a magazine publisher . would you send your credit info ... i think not . i 'd say do n't blame amazon as a previous reviewer did . hey , the magazine is good if you can get a subscription
mag	american heritage is a fine magazine brought to us by the same publishers who bring us forbes magazine . it is a magazine that examines history in all shapes and forms , examining past events and cultural changes that have shaped the american nation . one thing about this magazine that you will notice right away is that it is not just a magazine about american political history or the type of history that you remember from your school days . it does talk about this type of history , but it also includes stories about music , art , and other topics , breaking them apart and explaining how and why things happened the way they did and how they compare to the present . it also points out facts from the past that are more obscure , making for some very stimulating reading . current events are also covered in this magazine , and in these instances , american heritage discusses present- day phenomena from an intellectual and critical standpoint , often comparing it to similar events in the american past . this helps to keep the magazine current and more in- tune with important issues of the day . history buffs will love this magazine , and so will those of an intellectual persuasion . the articles here are more thoughtful than other magazines and many of them require greater concentration . for these reasons , american heritage is not really a casual reading type of publication . it is intended for those who like to read , think , discuss , and debate . it 's one of my favorite magazines of its kind on the market today .
mag	i ordered this thinking it was a magazine , it is more like a newspaper . it has good information , but it was not what i thought it would be .
mag	not as deep as macworld but worth the subscription due to the alternative perspective on software and hardware . very fun to read with a unique style of writing . the reviews can rarely be spotty with lack of depth as the culprit in some cases . the majority , though , are on target . the best part of the magazine are the unique 3rd party hardware finds . overall a great addition and enjoyable read
mag	i subscribe to entertainment weekly , premiere , and any magazine with a photo of johnny depp or hobbits on the cover , but scr ( i ) pt is my favorite magazine . every issue of scr ( i ) pt has articles by the screenwriters of movies that are just opening , explaining something about how the movie was written and featuring excerpts from the screennplay of that movie . these are triply helpful , as they ( 1 ) provide insight into how a successful screenwriter works his craft , ( 2 ) supply brief examples of what the movie you just saw ( or are about to see ) looks like on the page , and ( 3 ) are a useful tool in deciding which movie to go see saturday night . each issue also has articles of the more general how to ... variety , although these range from how to write great scenes/characters to how to pitch to studios to why studio execs are using your script to wrap fish . for a while there was a series of articles that were simply a compilation of all the genre cliches , written in the hopes that if you knew what they were you could avoid them ; they were invariably hilarious . these how to/writing advice articles are often extremely funny ( this is not meant as an insult -- they are meant to be funny as well as helpful ) . finally , every issue has the news on sales , contest winners , and whatnot that is essential for any working screenwriter , with a generous helping of heartwarming success stories to keep your spirits up while you 're waiting to hear from the studios . i highly recommend this magazine . enjoy
mag	quite frankly this is the only cooking magazine i have ever subscribed to that i actually have looked forward to using and to receiving every two months . i like it so much i am writing my first amazon review ! the format of the magazine makes it easy to follow the recipes - they are always printed on two pages across from each other - and unlike some of the other posters i prefer the black and white format so that the paper is thicker and does n't tear easily . having tear away ads ( for their own products ) on the outside of the magazine means that the usable portion does n't take up much space on my shelf . the recipes are easy to follow and usually clear . when they include specialized ingredients there is usually also a substitution listed . their product reviews are terrific - i wish i had n't wasted so many dinners on bad whole wheat pasta . my only gripe , as someone who does not have a dishwasher , is the great number of bowls and kitchen tools the recipes require . i have made at least half the recipes from the magazines , many several times , which is no small feat for a `` flexitarian '' who never has meat as a main dish .
mag	after been loaned this issue of june 2004 , by a committed , really genuine episcopalian , i was greatly impressed ! these creative , unique articles captured my imagination : `` what is power ? '' by sam keen ; `` taking the first step '' by anna lappe` ; `` accessing sacred energy , '' by judith orloff , md ; `` the making of a chaplain '' by karen o'brien ( so like the pages of my earlier verbatim in cpe ) . `` the best spiritual books '' are reviews of 50 out of 300 books by fred and mary ann brussat ! we surely agreed on the first few named : `` the heart of christianity '' marcus borg ; `` beyond belief '' elaine pagels ; `` the wisdom way of knowing '' cynthia bourgeault ; ++ `` the lord is my shepherd '' rabbi kushner+ `` the power of patience '' by m j ryan ! i am still in the whirlwind of those emotionally stimulating , artistically written articles on varied yet potent topics of food for thought and reflection . retired chaplain fred w hood
mag	real simple is exactly what the name implies . there is no clutter on the pages , which is fitting because this is the best magazine for people combatting clutter . it 's excellent for those individuals that ca n't multi-task well and never throw anything away
mag	i have yet to receive even one issue . i looked on the in touch magazine sight and it said that i have already received 6 issues . i will never order a magazine subscription through this company or through amazon again
mag	i subscribed to this magazine at the same time as the conte nast traveler , and i 'm going to keep this subscription and let the other one expire . this magazine has articles about places not about ( as one other reviewer wrote ) articles about martinis , fashion etc . it also has a lot less advertisements and when there are ads they are relevant more to travelers . it probably all boils down to what kind of travel you prefer to do and read about but for me this magazine is my preferred one
mag	i echo the same gripe that other reviewers have voiced here : the magazine covers the same handful of people week after week after boring week . how many times is a reader going to see no talents such as jessica simpson , lindsay lohan , the tom cruise-katie holmes joke , and the most overrated , overhyped people of all time brad pitt and angelina jolie on the cover and not get tired of it ? it 's nice to know what 's going on with certain celebrities once in a while but every single week ? can you say `` overkill ? '' i 'm glad i never got a subscription to this magazine . i picked it up every once in a while on the newsstand but stopped because i was so sick and tired of reading about overrated , overhyped and glorified b-movie `` actors '' and `` actresses '' who were lucky to be in one successful movie and have n't done anything of value since . i picked up a copy today and have sworn it off forever . do n't waste your time or your money . - donna di giacom
mag	i 've been a subscriber of e magazine ( which stands for the environmental magazine ) for over a year now and i love it . it is , by far , the best environmentally oriented magazine i 've come across . all of the ads are for environmentally-friendly companies and products , i now purchase products at at least 50 % of the places advertised in this magazine . e magazine covers topics all over the world , including global warming , horse meat ( popular in europe ) , whaling , deforestation , etc . if you are concerned or interested in environmental issues , i would highly recommend a subscription to this magazine . the issues are bi-monthly but are absolutely action-packed and fact-filled . subscribe today
mag	a friend once said to me , `` if you want a glossy that is a no brainer then get vogue ! '' how right she is , despite having glorious photography , fashion models that dare n't stand sideways or you would n't be able to see them and the occasional good article in it , i have to admit i find vogue too pretentious . vogue wants to be the voice of fashion , the voice of the high brow media but its clientele are the likes of you and me , ordinary people who ca n't afford to live the high life they are portraying on its gloss filled pages . personally i 'd rather spend my money on a movie ticket , i get to see a good thriller , sci-fi , romance etc , etc i do n't have to know about the substence abuse and emotional demons that haunt a particular actor 's life , i 'm just interested in enjoying myself for a couple of hours before i go back to my hard working life in the real world . vogue is trying to sell me a dream that i do n't really want to buy into , never had a penchant for selling my soul to the devil , it 's gets two stars though because the photography is really superb , shame about the rest of it though
mag	this is not my favorite fitness magazine . this is the size of a reader 's digest , but is packed with ads just like a beauty magazine . i find this a bit disappointing considering the breadth of information they tend to cover . they share reasonable and attainable goals , and suggestions for us normal people . the magazine seems to cover a wide age group , with information that is good for both young and old . they do offer recipes , workout suggestions , and much more . the magazine takes little time to read , and seems to only serve as a springboard for more follow up on topics you enjoy . i think this is a better magazine to browse through at the supermarket than to purchase
mag	i ordered on 10/4/2005 . as of march 27th , i still have n't received the first issue , i do n't even want it now ! how do i get credit for the payment made back in october
mag	they allowed me to try one issue before i paid for the subscription . after i read the first issue , i decided to cancel . there are a couple of good topics but the articles were poorly written , for example , you could n't see clearly what the conclusions or recommendations are . the rest of the magazines are all advertisements , which you can get for free from the internet ( or just anywhere )
mag	i have n't received this item . it has been almost two months
mag	while i rarely subscribe to magazines , i was looking for something to motivate me to exercise and so i signed up for a one year subscription to shape . before and during college i was a ballet dancer , but after entering the real , 9-5 working world half a year ago , exercise time became more difficult to find . unfortunately , i found that shape magazine was not really about exercise at all . it was about beauty products , fancy new-age spas and resorts , and trendy workout accessories . i was also shocked by the models on the magazine 's covers and pages . not only were they skinny but they usually sported next to nothing . i finally cancelled my subscription when a magazine came with a woman in a see-through , lacy top on the front of it , visible nipples and all . workout wear ? i think not ! trust me , the woman belonged in a porn magazine , not my exercise magazine
mag	as someone who has recently become more interested in a healthier , organic way of life , i decided to check out several magazines on the subject matter . many did not strike my fancy . for example , i found organic style magazine to be a little too fashion and product-oriented for my taste , while mind , body , and spirit fitness seems a little too redundant and does n't cover natural and organic living at all . natural health , however , falls somewhere in between , covering a nice array of topics including fitness/diet , natural remedies , beauty , and food/recipes . as someone who is not interested explicitly in holistic medicine and naturopathy , i appreciate the diversity this magazine has to offer . though many of the articles do cover ideas and products that are n't entirely natural or organic , i still find them to be useful . many items and articles , though not all , are vegetarian-friendly as well as eco-conscious , which i appreciate . one of my few complaints is that the articles can be short , sometimes merely `` glossing over '' many topics . however , if one piques my interest , it can be a decent jumping off point to do further research . though i ca n't compare with the previous version of the magazine that everyone else seems to have preferred , as i only began to pick this up at my local whole foods market in the last year , i can say that i am impressed with what natural health has to offer it 's readers . sure , there are several ads plaguing the pages , but i still feel as though there are far fewer advertisements than many of the magazines on the shelves today . besides , some of the ads have led me to decent products i would not have known of otherwise . furthermore , at this price , how can anyone really go wrong
mag	i like this magazine and i subscribe to it ( along with cooking for two and cook 's country ) , but i do n't think it 's perfect . i like when the magazine offers a several-page article with a formula for pasta salad or muffins , so i can make whatever flavor i choose and know it will turn out well . but the magazine does contain ads , despite what one reviewer claimed
mag	interview is one of my favorite magazines . the interviews are always good . i think that the interviews are more candid since it 's done by peers . i also think that the photo shoots in the interview are some of the best around
mag	i subscribed in late may to maximumpc and pcgamer . early july i started getting pcgamer . still nothing from maximumpc . i called customer service and they said they had recieved my order june 2nd and to expect my first issue in late september . thats nearly four months ! that is an unreasonable wait relative to the industry standard and clearly outside the stated wait on the order form . i gave one star because the magazine is a good magazine . but at a $ 8.99 news stand price it is too expensive ... so i am left with the choice of spending almost $ 35 to get the four months worth before my subscription starts ( more than the subscription itself ) or just missing out on those issue . very poor customer service .
mag	i made my subscription in january 23 , and it said shipped february 2 2007 and im still waiting for it ! today is march 19 200
mag	people magazine is one of the worst expressions of american life . instead of makiing our own lives more meaningful and exciting - which is possible - people encourages us to oogle and fixate over people who are essentially images , people we will never meet , and in many cases people who have very little going for them . does anyone really think that britney spears has anything to say about anything , or that paris hilton is barely aware of her own existence ? does it ever make a whit of difference to your life how many times j.lo is engaged ( in order to get on the cover of another magazine ) or who demi moore is grinding with today or where gweyneth gets her gowns
mag	casino player is the end-all magazine for the serious gambler ( and the gambler who likes weekend fun with lots of comps ! ) . it is one of the pricier magazines , but the cost is well worth it , and it is n't over-run with advertising . the letters to the editor touch on basic gaming , slot , and comp questions , and i always glean useful information from the q section . the magazine content covers slot machines , video poker strategy and probability , table game strategy and expected pay-offs , investing in the gaming industry 's publicly-held corporations , and reviews of properties , restaurants , and shows . i always read it before heading to vegas to learn what is new and happening on the strip and in the area . casino player provides balanced coverage of vegas , atlantic city , indian properties , and riverboat casinos . as a southern ca native , i usually skim features outside vegas , but the magazine should be commended for reaching out to gamblers in all parts of the country
mag	hi , i am writing this review in an attempt to help you save $ 10 . this magazine is an embarrassment in every angle . it is full of pictures of `` sexy '' boys/men dressed in cloths no guy with self esteem would ever wear . and pictures is all there is , for you that think there will be something interesting to read , read this : there is nothing in this magazine to read ! ! ! the latest issue contains of 48 ( forty-eight ) pages before you get to this issues contents . the first `` article '' starts on page 126 ( ! ) and is about `` why a man would like to slice of his testicles '' ! totally the magazine contains of 260 pages and there is text ( letters that forms sentences ) on about 40 of them . besides this , the magazine also has a huge dilemma of being a gay magazine or not . well i can go on and on but i wo n't . unfortunately i have a subscription and i am going to see if i can get it canceled , i do n't even need my money back . take your $ 10 and run them in the disposal , it will be more fun to clean out the disposal than `` read '' this magazine
mag	i have yet to receive even one issue . i looked on the in touch magazine sight and it said that i have already received 6 issues . i will never order a magazine subscription through this company or through amazon again
mag	change can be good ; however , sometimes change can be very bad . earlier this year pc mag decided to become a magazine for the masses instead of providing technical information for their longtime dedicated readers . before the change this was a magazine that i would keep for a year or so to refer back to the content ; now i can skim it in 5 minutes and do n't feel there is a reason to keep it for any length of time . as a longtime subscriber ( 20 years ) i will not be re-subscribing to the magazine . i wish them luck , but i believe they have lost sight of their subscription base and are chasing a broader base of subscribers that might disappoint them
mag	fantasy magazine has been around since 1949 , and is in my opinion one of the better scifi and fantasy mags on the market . it has a proven track record of publishing outstanding short stories , novellas , and novelettes that have later gone on to win hugo , nebula , and dark fantasy awards , which brings me to the 2006 june issue of the magazine : the june issue features an outstanding and very creepy novella entitled hallucigenia by laird barron . i predict an award for this chilling novella , which will be just another in a long and esteemed list of award worthy tales from fantasy barron 's story could be classed as a cthulhu mythos tale , although no where does the author allude to h.p . lovecraft 's works . it is simply that the recurring theme is a recognizable one to us mythos fans . highly recommended reading , and worth the subscription price .
mag	i 've been a p subscriber and reader ( even when not a subscriber ) for years . i 've also tried various other writers ' magazines , such as the writer and writer 's digest . the latter two were fine when i was just beginning to dip into the freelance market , just beginning to look at publishers for first manuscripts , but when i gained more experience , i soon realized those just did n't make the cut anymore . the articles were too often repetitive and geared towards such elementary basics that i was no longer gaining new insights . p was the next step up . p provides advice , inspiration , informative interviews , current resources for the more experienced and discriminating writer . the bimonthly issues include articles , detailed listings of markets , contests , grants , and helpful , relevant ads . for the price , this is the best magazine available today for the writer who has a portfolio already underway and keeping an ear to the ground for more , staying up to date with what 's rumbling in the literary world . with its up-to-date information , i 've been able to leave the others aside , including that old bible , writer 's market , which was , unfortunately , obsolete the moment it was off the presses . highly recommended for the writer wanting more .
mag	relevant magazine has great articles for people who are in to culture and faith . many of the reviews are of secular artists , the spiritual content or message ( or lack thereof ) of the music they sing , films they make and books they write . they also review christian artists , many who are on the fringe . this is a great magazine for those who are interested in these things . if you just want a 'youth-oriented ' christian magazine with bible studies and how-to 's you 'll probably be disapointed
mag	remember when the dawn of 24/7 cable news networks seemed to be a godsend ? now we know that that led to 24/7 garbage ( breaking news now means a peek at the food menu served to the self-confessed and deluded killer of jonbenet ramsay , the elevation of trivia to news status to fill time on a slow news day , the absence of any sort of perspective or background , the application of insane levels of urgency to minor health scares , endless celebrity gossip , etc. ) . i had enough of this nonsense . all i wanted was a brief summary of what was important with some context thrown in . all the truly significant news can be relayed in a brief period of time ; the rest is junk meant to fill in the time between commercials . more time spent on news does not mean being better informed because 24/7 news is simply obsession with the same few stories , repeated ad nauseum . i tried the christian science monitor . they have excellent standards but it is expensive to get every day . i then tried this publication . it met my needs . you get a complete summary of everything that was important in the previous week 's news with a minimum amount of fluff . celebrities are lucky to get a paragraph , if anything , in the entire issue . you come away from this magazine ( easily read in an hour ) with a great overview of all that mattered in the previous week . international and world stories get much more coverage than what you see on cnn , fox , or your local paper . there does n't seem to be any bias that i could detect . get this if you want to decrease your time spent on news but still be well informed . move over , you stodgy time and newsweek magazines
mag	this magazine if full of fun fashion items ! it shows you some great ideas of how to do things for the upcoming year ! its a definite go ! ! :
mag	all you manager types . you know who you are you read 'who moved the cheese ' and jesus ceo , this is the mag for you lame , trite and oh so self importen
mag	if you like cars then car and driver is the magazine for you.the writers are the best and the articles are informitive
mag	this one of the best magazine ever for science and new things , from car to everything . amazon is usually cheaper on magazines than anyone else and no hassell about calling all the time trying to sell you something . buy this mag . you will like it
mag	dear sirs as per your records i purchased the subscribtion to essence magazine on 08/19/2006 . and today 's date is november 6 , 2006 and i 've just recieved my first copy . i hope your company is keeping track of the delay in mailing this product . at this time i can not give this product a rating . respectfully , elizabeth de jesu
mag	i send away for a 2 year subscription , they sent me a 1 year sub , i wrote 5 letters , sent copies of bank cheque and order form , emailed them , no response , they could care less , what more can i do ?
mag	unless you want the editor 's liberal political views shoved down your throat , avoid this magazine . it leans to the left so hard that you have to lie on your side to even read it . ( and no , i am not a republican or democrat , but an independent who looks at all sides ) . the editor of this magazine has a huge agenda to get the democrats back in power , he bashes bush and the republican party over the head with a 10-ton hammer on a monthly basis , yet worships eco-phonies like laurie david and celebrities who want the rest of us to drive eco-friendly cars while they fly the world in their private jets . ( i understand laurie and her friends like sheryl crow are `` trying '' to wean themselves off this practice by cutting down on their private jet hopping trips a wee bit and using a huge gas guzzling bus that is criss-crossing the country instead , but that poor laurie is finding this hard to give up . what hyprocrites these hollywood folks are ! ) though i am personally trying to do my bit for the environment , i hate when i read issues like the current `` green '' issue where these so called eco-environmentalists really only want us `` common people '' to make the changes . this used to be a great fashion , entertainment and current event magazine with a lot of in-depth articles , but now it is only a political platform publication . i now will just throw it away as soon as it arrives when i receive it , until my subscription expires
mag	esquire may be a man 's magazine , but i enjoy the articles as a woman , because it is no holes barred feedback with the rough edges included . i got my first issue a couple weeks back , and found it funny , informative , great pic of tom petty , and i 'm looking forward to more issues
mag	i subscribed in late may to maximumpc and pcgamer . early july i started getting pcgamer . still nothing from maximumpc . i called customer service and they said they had recieved my order june 2nd and to expect my first issue in late september . thats nearly four months ! that is an unreasonable wait relative to the industry standard and clearly outside the stated wait on the order form . i gave one star because the magazine is a good magazine . but at a $ 8.99 news stand price it is too expensive ... so i am left with the choice of spending almost $ 35 to get the four months worth before my subscription starts ( more than the subscription itself ) or just missing out on those issue . very poor customer service .
mag	`` as we grow older and realize more clearly the limitations of human happiness , we come to see that the only real and abiding pleasure in life is to give pleasure to other people . '' ~p.g . wodehouse , something new creative advertising ( love the ge firefly ad ) , practical advice for your home and luxurious perfumes all blend effortlessly throughout the pages of real simple . there i was wondering when i should replace a down comforter and this magazine had the answer . they also have some lovely quotes and ideas for decorating your home with liz claiborne home items , like the lovely bedding and towels . the do it yourself features are fun with ideas like a hostess gift you make up yourself with a basket and candles . loved the articles like `` organizing your recipes ; 8 foolproof methods . '' but their advice on tossing cookbook in favor of just keeping a few recipes ! hello . there are some cookbooks you definitely want to keep . they always seem to put a spin on old favorites , like the modern cheesecake that is gourmet and elegant . the applesauce cake in the november issue uses chunky applesauce so people might think you spent all that time chopping apples . ~the rebecca review
mag	this is not the health magazine you 'd expect from martha stewart -- it 's extremely heavy on advertisements ( 45 % at my rough count ) , and really cluttered , and just not `` good '' . the recipes are interesting , if you can find them among the aromatherapy and skin-hydration ads
mag	i ordered this as a gift subscription on may 10 . by july 20 , it still had not arrived . i contacted customer service , and was told it would n't arrive until september ! the description says it will take 6-10 weeks . it has now been 10 weeks , and i 've been informed it will be another 6 weeks
mag	the smartest , best-informed , and most , well , entertaining writing about entertainment and popular culture . i read it cover to cove
mag	it is a shame but the reviewer that made the comment that this magazine does not have any balanced view of what is serious world news and what is fluff hit the nail on the head . it skims the surface and is 'pop ' . anyone reading this would be entertained but be none the wiser about what is going on in the real world . again it is a shame if this is all people have to read on what is going on in the world ( newsweek is exactly the same ) especially in the united states . time magazine is from the same people that gave us cnn and is unfortunately symptomatic of the liberal media and the inexorable consolidation of all media particularly in the u.s. and the resulting blandness and lack of real choice . the other irritating thing about time is it 's tone which is patronising and a little supercilious . subscribe to the economist , there are less pictures !
mag	men 's journal has got ta be one of the best deals in the whole wide world of magazines . for 10 bucks you get wonderful photography , health tips , product reviews of cool stuff you 'll covet , smart writing and , of course , regular features by that greatest of american ink-spillers , jim harrison . heck , if they just photo copied the harrison pieces and sent them to me in a plain white envelope , ten bucks would still be a screaming deal . however , i still dig the fashion spreads , the book notes and the travel writing . there is a consistant sense of adventure , curiosity and life well lived in this magazine , which is why it should earn a spot on your coffee table . did i mention it 's only ten bucks
mag	i also bought this magazine sight-unseen and i wish i had n't . for re-decorating purposes , i found this magazine to be not useful at all . the homes and gardens are pretty , but what they feature ( furniture , wall and window coverings ) just would not go with the middle-class home ... way too opulent . i was wanting more of a magazine that could give me a look that can be found in local or chain furniture stores ... not that would try to make me get a one-of-a-kind table from xyz antique store in new york . also , i found this magazine text-heavy . all in all , an ok magazine for a professional decorater maybe , but not for a average home-owner trying to redecorate
mag	should i require more information on asphalt , i 'll subscribe to the practical paving newsletter , maybe attend the world of asphalt 2007 show conference . in the meantime , the `` world 's leading bike magazine '' has whet the appetite with a dozen-page spread on the stuff in their september '06 issue . on a positive note , the giro helmet ad with floyd landis is sure to become a collectible
mag	i have a one yr old who enjoys babybug and a 2 yr old who enjoys ladybug . these are just the best children 's publications . we save every babybug for posterity because the art is fantastic . ca n't recommend these enough to family and friends .
mag	ok , the advertisements are a bit much , but the magazine is great . my son has subscriptions to cricket and kids discover , too . he has had many other magazine subscriptions over the years , and this one stands out to me because , unprompted , he has always found fun information that he felt was worth sharing . this magazine was also a favorite with my niece who does not like to read at all . the magazine format is easy to read , yet rich in content
mag	this is the intelligent fashion magazine that does n't treat fashion lovers like idiots ! great in depth articles on screenplays , celebs , charities , politics , and of course - fashion . duh !
mag	i ordered kiplingers and us news on march 25 and was immediately charged for both subscriptions . today is october 12th and i 've never received us news . i 've complained several times and been given a variety of excuses and promised a refund and free subsciption which of course i have n't received . when i requested a refund of course i was given the wrong amount . if you want to order magazines i agree with the last reviewer go to another site because while amazon is great for books that have n't got the magazine business straight . also , the customer service phone numbers are wrong and this is a total mess .
mag	back in the 1970 's my grandmother subscribed to prevention . at that time , it was a wonderful magazine , filled with informative articles aimed at the `` prevention '' of illness and the promotion of wellness ( as the founder of prevention , j.i . rodale had preached ) . articles about the role of vitamins and nutrition were light years ahead of their time . ( j.i . can be given a lot of credit for bringing vitamins and supplements to the mainstream ) . over the years , and especially after the tragic death of robert rodale ( j.i . 's son ) , and the takeover by his wife and daughter , it has unfortunately transformed into a fluffy , tabloid-like `` women 's magazine '' with scantily clad women on the covers , and one- or two-page articles instructing women to get killer abs and burn the fat . i think j.i . rodale is probably spinning in his grave to see what his descendents have done to butcher this magazine , which bears no resemblence whatsoever to what it used to be . i flipped through a copy in disgust recently to note , as another reviewer has stated , plenty of ads for drugs which really seems to go against the idea of preventing illness in the first place ( whereas the old prevention sang the praises of vitamins and health foods ) . i do n't know why the rodale family does n't just scrap the title and call it something else , but alas , they are a major corporation now and i have little hope that this magazine will improve any time soon
mag	this is the most accurate geo-political and socio-economic english-language news-weekly there is . period . articles are succinct , top-notch , and cover everything from the world today to business , economics to the environment . i do think the magazine tends to focus a bit too little on the environment and religion , but that is my perception . despite the editorial style and very sophisticated diction , articles are still easy to understand . true , this magazine ( or newspaper , as it calls itself ) is staunchly pro-democracy ( i.e . broadly speaking , anti-russian policy , anti-chinese policy in their respective conflicts , say , over georgia or taiwan , and pro-war on the iraq issue ) , pro-free trade , and pro-european ( i.e . for the expansion of the eu ) . but it takes many conservative and liberatarian positions , too , and oftentimes even liberal ones , which , overall , makes the magazine fairly objective - you 'll usually get all or most of the points-of-view after reading just a few articles on the same subject , although the economist usually does imply , or sometimes downright state , which position it takes or the world must take . actually that 's the best part : it is very refreshing to have a magazine that is not afraid to share its opinion and offer its advice to readers , hence its influence . this , for me , is the icing on the cake . as an economics and international relations student , i have been receiving the economist for some three years already . in that short time span , it has been a source -- usually the main source -- of dozens of my essays and country reports ( the country or topical surveys published every several weeks are excellent for this ! ) and reading the magazine has increased my english vocabulary significantly . i finally feel that my vocabulary has increased from third-grade level to college-level . yes , it does indeed take a few weeks to get used to the unique writing style , but the magazine is indispensible . to some it may appear arrogant , which is what i tend to sense at times , but that does not mean it is a bad magazine . quite simply , it tends to think of itself as sophisticated , and rightfully so . while half-owned by the financial times , many of the economist 's authors also write for the latter , which can help explain while the two are similar . but while the financial times is a daily newspaper with fairly brief articles and a 50-50 slant on news and finance/business , the economist 's articles , while also succinct , focus on everything in the world that impacts people . and that is why it 's an excellent summary of the world this week for those people with little time on their hands . finally , i do not necessarily sense an anti-semitic slant as stated in one previous review . yes , i am jewish , but i tend to regard the economist 's proposed solutions -- such as dealing with hamas politically ( despite their `` militancy '' ) , as they can not be destroyed -- to of the middle east conflict as mere pragmatism at work . the same with its proposal to legalize various drugs . not that both of these things will ever happen in today 's world ( the mid-east conflict wo n't end ; drugs wo n't be decriminalized in most countries ) , but the thinking is purely pragmatic , which is refreshing for a world so increasingly bent on political correctness . in this respect , as in the aforementioned ones , i feel the magazine is a lot more objective overall than many others , despite the specific positions it takes in particular articles . it makes for a truly fascinating read . it is most surely the investment it claims to be , so for any of those with any remaining doubts , the $ 129 subscription price ( $ 77 for students ) is more than worth it . just read three or four issues and you 'll see . trust me
mag	trashy magazine , it only focuses on sex . like if sex is going to solve your emotional problems . this culture is so obssesed with sex . if you really want to read about relationships , i recommend `` save your marriage before it starts '' it gives you real info from two psychologist why marriage is going downhill and how you can save it
mag	real simple is exactly what the name implies . there is no clutter on the pages , which is fitting because this is the best magazine for people combatting clutter . it 's excellent for those individuals that ca n't multi-task well and never throw anything away
mag	as someone who has recently become more interested in a healthier , organic way of life , i decided to check out several magazines on the subject matter . many did not strike my fancy . for example , i found organic style magazine to be a little too fashion and product-oriented for my taste , while mind , body , and spirit fitness seems a little too redundant and does n't cover natural and organic living at all . natural health , however , falls somewhere in between , covering a nice array of topics including fitness/diet , natural remedies , beauty , and food/recipes . as someone who is not interested explicitly in holistic medicine and naturopathy , i appreciate the diversity this magazine has to offer . though many of the articles do cover ideas and products that are n't entirely natural or organic , i still find them to be useful . many items and articles , though not all , are vegetarian-friendly as well as eco-conscious , which i appreciate . one of my few complaints is that the articles can be short , sometimes merely `` glossing over '' many topics . however , if one piques my interest , it can be a decent jumping off point to do further research . though i ca n't compare with the previous version of the magazine that everyone else seems to have preferred , as i only began to pick this up at my local whole foods market in the last year , i can say that i am impressed with what natural health has to offer it 's readers . sure , there are several ads plaguing the pages , but i still feel as though there are far fewer advertisements than many of the magazines on the shelves today . besides , some of the ads have led me to decent products i would not have known of otherwise . furthermore , at this price , how can anyone really go wrong
mag	i greatly enjoyed reading this magazine in years past . however , i have not received anything yet from my amazon.com order . i am eagerly waiting for my subscription to start ! !
mag	i never bought gq back in my 20s because for one thing , i never thought of myself as a clothes-horse . also , i actually took the g in gq to mean that it was actually for gentlemen , ie , sipping champagne on a yacht pass me the the caviar type gentlemen . well , after now having reached a `` certain age '' i find myself going back and forth between esquire and gq and find that in many cases , neither are exactly right for me . however , i think i 've bought my last episode of gq . the 2006 `` interview '' with will ferrel was interesting for the first three paragraphs , and then it became an excercise in self referentialism , disguised as an attempt at wit . also , the politics of the magazine are unabashedly anti-bush administration , which would be ok except for the fact that i 'm not reading gq for political content . there are plenty of magazines out there make this their specialty , and when i find it in gq , its just tiresome . frequently , swipes at bush and his policies just come out of nowhere in an article , as if the editor decided that a jab at bush and his policies might help the piece , regardless of its content . not to mention - does anyone actually wear the clothing they put on display ? $ 800 tennis shoes ? i fear that i will be an esquire reader - i ca n't bear to become a `` men 's best life '' subscriber just yet
mag	i 've been a subscriber for over fifteen years , and will probably continue to subscribe until the day i die . but at times i find national geographic frustrating . i have no interest in soccer , nor do i want a huge fold-out map discussing the sport . are n't there more phenomenal things going on in the world today ? also , geographic does have its pet topics . how many articles must we read about pandas ? a dozen ? i like pandas , believe me , but surely there are other less cute animals to discuss . also i could do without lectures and pc environmental propaganda . the articles about oil-drilling in alaska was filled with a thinly veiled agenda which was preachy and annoying . yeah , we get it , you do n't want alaska drilled . can we move on , please ? other articles are quite interesting . i enjoy the zip code discussion , the old-fashioned pictures , and articles about countries . i could do with fewer articles about underwater archaeology though , and the articles filled with preachy environmentalist scolding gets boring . a friend of mine ( a joe average type guy ) , said he stopped subscribing to geographic because the articles were depressing him . i tried to argue with him , because i think the magazine is great- but i do kind of have to agree , the topics of late are downbeat and are n't particularly uplifting . i do believe the magazine is getting a little 'out there ' with its choice of topics , too . i recommend this magazine for those interested in the environment and the world around them
mag	you can tell a lot about the readership a men 's magazine is trying to reach by scanning the first three car ads . in the issue in front of me , they flog the lincoln mkz , range rover sport , and audi a6 . there you have it . we 're going for the affluent but not super-rich young guy who wo n't even become aware that the lincoln town car and audi a8 exist until he turns 55 . well , 52 maybe . but you did n't need the cars to figure out men 's health . it 's about what all men think about and what affluent guys with six-pack abs ( in reality or in their dreams ) can generally snag : expensive suits , beautiful women who seem never not to pout , and beefy arms to set off those abs . to be fair , there is actually a fair amount of *health* under discussion in these pages . but i doubt that 's the main reason guys pull this magazine off the shelf instead of , say , dog fanciers . in spite of an irritating habit of treating women as trophies to be won or dupes to be lured , there is a good bit of wit in here about what one might call the manly dilemma in the modern world . and if it really is lack of *just* the right workout regimen that has kept you from getting all that 's on offer in men 's world , where there 's at least one new workout each month that will cure all that ails you . do n't mistake this monthly for serious journalism . but you wo n't need a brown paper bag to carry it out of the store either . i kind of like it
mag	... i highly recommend this magazine to anyone interested or immersed in the graphic design industry . i have kept every single issue and frequently refer to them for ideas , reference , or to simply get those creative juices flowing . how 's biggest asset is their dedication to helping the reader understand the business side of the industry and the all important client relationship . how does not exclude anyone in that they address the different issues agencies and freelancers face when conducting business
mag	today i purchased my first and probably last issue of gourmet . while there were plenty of recipes ( some of which i wo n't use but they were still cool to look at ) there were tons of ads . it makes you wonder either a ) how much the people who make this magazine get paid or b ) for all the ads why this is n't free . i can see the need for a few ads so that we the consumers do n't have to pay a fortune for a good magazine . but i took out 33 pages of ads and figured there were about 140 full page ads . that 's over half of the magazine which is 260 pages . that 's really sad . recipe wise , some of them look interesting and very gourmet , but there are things you need to have that i ca n't get in the middle of the u.s. and about three of the six articles were interesting to read - when you could find them slipped inbetween their plethora of ads . fine cooking is still the best one out there
mag	i have been a subscriber to threads since it 's inaugural issue , and have saved every one . the publishers , writers and editors have uncompromising standards for accuracy , originality and inspiration . while the magazine has evolved over the years , and away from accessory crafts such as knitting , it has nevertheless remained the premier publication for fine sewing . some articles are geared towards the advanced sewers , but many basic techniques and information are shown and explained more clearly , in more easy to understand depth , than any other publication of it 's type . the pictures and diagrams are professional and clear . the instructions well written . even the advertising is worth perusing . top caliber all around
mag	this is a magazine for paid product-placement in articles , tons of ads , and so-so articles . you are paying for the name , and getting much less in return . i highly recommend fine homebuilding instead of this old house . you will not only see fabulous new and old construction , but actually take something away from it ( that is the point behind magazines , right ? ) a magazine that actually saved me money ! i 'm cancelling my subscription to t.o.h . and adding another year onto my fine homebuilding subscription . it 's money well spent
mag	laptop mag can be best described negatively : it 's not a really serious computer magazine . it 's more or less like consumer guide , which is basically paid advertising . this means you ca n't really trust the article here because you do n't know if they are not written by unbiased writers . in the end , i feel this is a waste of money . besides , you can get all the info for free on the web , from cnet or zdnet , anyway
mag	i got a subscription for my father on father 's day , and he really likes it . recommend it
mag	i 've read other personal finance magazines before and found them to be either too basic to be worth my time , or too focused on some obscure area . i 'm not a financial professional , but i like to constantly increase my knowledge of personal finance . kiplinger 's has been great for that . i skip 80 % of the articles in this magazine , but that still leaves one or two in every issue that teach me about an area i did n't know about -- where to buy bonds online the most cheaply , how to find good financial advice , why options are priced the way they are . one good article pays for the entire annual subscription . each issue has a wide range of articles appealing to lots of levels of experience
mag	this magazine is ill ! i learn about all the new albums coming out , read the review , and if they say they are good , i go out and buy 'em . the reviews are also accurate , giving the appropiate number of stars . i also love the sections on the new artists on the verge . the cover stories never seem to dis-please me , always givin ' me plent of info . the mini articles are cool , too , from stuff like warren 's sapp 's all-star football team , to all about how mike jones was discovered . one last thing i love about the magazine - they are never thin issues , and you know what that means ! ! !
mag	i do n't know a single super-successful business person , and i know hundreds from coast to coast , who do not read and recommend inc. magazine . inc. is the single best business magazine , bar none
mag	this is a great magazine for cat lovers even if you do n't have a cat . it talks about care tips as well as stories about other cats
mag	video game magazines have been all the rage in our lives . yet there are just so many of them that tell different stories for different video game systems . that has been the case with one of the biggest-selling ones of all time , gamepro . they truly have made it one the most provocative and well in-depth magazines with detail about what games are popular according to their writers , and what upcoming games and systems are all in the works . the magazine is quite well , but i honestly do wish they could try to publish more in the way of codes and helpful hints for several games for gamecube and game boy advance , when most of it primarily focuses in on playstation 2 xbox . yet , gamepro really handles itself as a very deep gamer 's magazine . anybody who wants to be enjoy the field of video games , this magazine is worth reading . overall : b 1/2
mag	for years discover was the best magazine for the lay person or even scientists who wanted to keep track of the trends in other fields of science . now with a new publisher it has become almost worthless . very superficial articles are mixed with over blown headlines and poor science . after buying discover since it 's very inception i find it sad what has happened to this magazine . check the dates and notice the glowing reviews for the old magazine but pay attention to the negative ones from the last 6 months
mag	we 've been receiving your big backyard for a couple of years now and my daughter really looks forward to receiving it each month . the stories are alot of fun to read and it really encourages us to learn and talk about animals that we would n't if we did not receive the magazine . after we read it my daughter enjoys making collages from her favorite pictures . i highly recommend it
mag	amazon must think we are fools . it 's $ 4 cheaper directly from stewart 's website . on the other hand , there appear to be a lot of fools here
mag	i first came across taste of home magazine about 10 years ago . some friends of mine were quite the experimental couple who loved to try out new recipes . as the recipient of tasty appetizers , dips , and desserts , i asked them for the recipes . it was then that they shared this magazine with me ... and i 've been a subscriber ever since ! each magazine features several special features , as well as mainstay departments such as potluck pleasers , my mom 's best meal , getting in the theme of things , and super snacks and appetizers . arguably the best part of this magazine is their clip-and-keep section of recipes which feature color photos of the dish . just cut out the recipe , and ouila ! it 's ready for your recipe box . other information-packed sections include ask our food editor , touring country kitchens , ted 's toothpick contest , lively leftovers , and more . each issue also features a recipe contest to win cold , hard cash . some of the great recipes that are in the most recent issue include : swiss-stuffed porkchops open-faced turkey tacos spinach shrimp fettuccine coffee 'n ' cream brownies cucumber potato salad asparagus chicken crepes hearty jambalaya barvarian strawberry pie and many more . besides being tasty dishes , one of the great things about the recipes in taste of home is that they do n't call for some exotic ingredients . rather , they feature ingredients that can be found in any department store ... even if you live in an out-of-the-way rural area ! some of the recipes are n't exactly `` quick '' , which is why i give it four stars . there are certainly quite a few quick and easy recipes , but there are also some that take quite a bit of prep work . if you 're looking for a magazine with mostly quick recipes , try their sister publication , quick cooking ( i subscribe to that one , as well ... and actually like it better . ) taste of home has no ads ( amazing ! ) , so it 's nice that the magazine is chock full of recipes and information -- not fillers and ads . this magazine also is very `` country '' , so if you 're looking for something trendy and cosmopolitan , this mag may not be for you . but if you like down-home country cookin ' , you 'll likely love this magazine
mag	in the several years since my retirement , i have come to wait by my trusty old rusted metal mailbox around the third or fourth of every month , waiting for my monthly issue of two magazines , the atlantic monthly and harpers . each in iuts own way is likely the best amalgams of intellectual articles on a variety of subjects one can find in contemporary america , and each features a stable of highly regarded writers and authors . for good reason ; from subjects as arcane as the supposed imminent fall of the soviet union based on demographic and economic analysis in the mid-1980s to the recent synopsis of former spy robert baer regarding the evils of dealing with the highly corrupted saudi regime , the magazine consistently offers an erudite , informative , and provocative look at aspects of contemporary reality one can not find elsewhere . needless to say , i really enjoy reading harpers , especially under the guidance of editor lewis lapham , and its articles often lead me on amazon searches for tomes by the talented authors , which in the case of said author robert baer , or perpetually sagacious satirist p.j . o'rourke , or a whole raft of noteable others . all of them lead to some worthwhile reading experiences indeed . it avoids the trendy , so we are spared the suffering through the latest and greatest mass experiences in favor of intellectual roads less traveled , being grassy and rather wont of wear , makes for better and more satisfying traveling , whether trudging through the snow with my wintertime dunham tyroleans or padding down grassy fields in my summertime birkenstocks . just keep on trucking ! enjoy !
mag	this magazine consistently encourages parents to spend more than $ 100 on babya outfits , etc . it is not a magazine for most of america , but rather for the elite , or those who wish to pretend they are . there are way too many ads , and insignificant articles . parents magazine is hands down the winner in this category .
mag	writer 's digest puts out a lot of great resources for writers . the magazine ai n't one of them , however . for starters about half of the magazine is ads - mostly for other writer 's digest products . one you get past paying $ 19.95 a year for what 's essentially a brochure , you 'll notice that most of the articles do n't apply to you . most writers stick to one genre , yet the magazine focuses on all aspects of writing - fiction , poetry , business writing , editing , non-fiction , etc . if you 're working on a biography of j. edgar hoover , do you need to look at an article on poetry in the stlye of ee cummings ? i 'll take `` no '' for $ 600 , alex . so , now you 're down to about 10 pages that might be relevant . well , let 's start chipping away at that : the letters about grammar questions are a waste : if you have a question about affect versus effect , would you write to a magazine and wait a month or two or would you pick up your style guide and have an answer in less time than it took for you to read this sentence ? thought so . ( furthermore the idea that someone would write to a magazine with a question like that is so incredulous one has to wonder if the questions are n't just submitted by staff members in an attempt to fill space , like i used to do when i was the news editor at my college paper . ) writer 's digest does review software and other technology that might be useful to writers . my favorite was when it reviewed microsoft word . thanks - i 'm sure most readers had no idea about the monopolistic word-processing program . to be fair , some of the reviews are useful , although you can get better information just by looking up the product on amazon.com and reading the reviews there . if you 're going to writer 's digest for market information , you 'd be better served elsewhere : the annual writer 's market publication has all the markets and is more thorough , whilst the writer 's market website has all that information and is up-to-date . your money would be better spent on those two products . about the only articles i have found useful are the profiles on authors and how they have succeeded . there you have it : two or three pages an issue that are useful . if you 're trying to get your work published , writer 's digest has several other products that are a better investment than its magazine : go with the annual writer 's market book , the website , and pick up a style manual of your choosing ( chicago is the best ) . do n't waste your money on this magazine
mag	eqmm is definitely a worthwhile magazine for any true fan of mysteries . is every story exceptional , of course not and that 's unrealistic to expect it to be . the stories are however entertaining and you get the opportunity to see something from some of your favorite writers . i think it 's enjoyable to read a short story from writers you like whether it is a surefire classic or just another tale . to address , some of the issues by the jaded first reviewer , look at it from the standpoint of a mystery lover . if the publishers only produced great classic books , we would have only a handful of books each year , instead of the masses that readers have the fun of combing thru each year . the pages smudge , but this is not a magazine that is mass produced like people or time or sports illustrated . at the current price , you could probably only get one to two stories a month for glossy pages . if you 're reluctant to get a subscription then at least go to your local bookstore and buy the latest copy of eqmm and find out for yourself how enjoyable getting a quick glimpse into dozen of mystery writers can be
mag	do n't get me wrong , occasionally there are issues i still read cover to cover , but it seems as though mj has gone through a change lately . gone is the focus of travel and fantastic adventure writing . now the focus seems to be health , fitness and diet . i used to buy men 's health magazine for those topics . if i wanted that focus i would continue to buy mh . there is no longer a consistent reason to read mj on a regular basis anymore . man , i miss the old mj
mag	out of all the magazines i have ever recieved , this is my favorite . the writers and editors have a immense sense of humor and are knowledgable about what they write about . this magazine is creative , funny , and very informative . the articles are very thorough in facts and the writers go to great lengths to write them . although some people may think that this magazine is for kids ; adults enjoy this magazine too ! i know , my parents read my magazine almost right after i 'm done ! they love it ! recently , there was an article about tombs or whatever you call them near paris . i showed the article to my french teacher and she even learned something new ! this magazine should have 10 stars instead of 5 ! -kricke
mag	this is not the health magazine you 'd expect from martha stewart -- it 's extremely heavy on advertisements ( 45 % at my rough count ) , and really cluttered , and just not `` good '' . the recipes are interesting , if you can find them among the aromatherapy and skin-hydration ads
mag	i thought my first issue of your magazine was a little sparse . it was a very thin issue . the models were beautiful . this was good.but you knowif you would include more in depth articlessuch as really in depth stuff about skin and hair . like i said before aging skin needs more done to it and some things like micro-dermabrasion could be helpful . also 8 glasses a water a day is the most helpful thing a woman could do for herself . beside plastic surgery , theres not much for them to do . but i will saythis , to enlarge lips i put a vitamin e capsule on my lips , and then honey and then a good lip moisturizer and leave it on overnight . it doees make the lips plumper . also i use baby powder on my face as a face powder . sometimes i use this just on my nose and chin . sometimes i use half mayonaise and conditioner and mix them together to make the mayonaise smell better on the hair . sometimes i use vitamin oil in my bath water such as vitamin e a person can buy this at the dollar store . im not rich but i do some things to help the way i look at my age . then you could include pictures of mountains and rivers and stories of people . then you could have articles on celebrities like frank converse , robert blake , really interesting ones like that . paul newman has always got something to say interesting . also what ever happened to actor richard hatch who starred in the hitchhikers ? someone told me the other day that the most handsome actor there was or is was yul brynner . i didnt see that as i should . i dont know if you agree with that or not but it would be interesting to see a profile of the way he lived .i like brad pitt and those people are always great . i love jennifer anniston because she she is higher up than most women in her thoughts and actions.angelina jolie i really like too beacause women do like these women . i miss johnny carson and they really need to find someone to replace him . yes there is people like that still in the world . ive found some of them . well thank you
mag	each issue of family circle is full of useful information . ordering it through amazon is so easy . a few clicks on the computer and you are done
mag	forget about shop etc ... lucky is the best shopping mag by far . i got alot of coupons for full size products an , samples inside of lucky magazine . i love me some free samples ! i am from nyc and you have to know what 's wearing and all , so this mag let me know a whole lot about fashion , makeup , hair produts , house wares etc
mag	the weekly standard clearly has a conservatinve `` bent . '' however , it is not the sort that screams , `` this is the only way to think about this topic . '' it is thoughtful commentary , delivered with well crafted writing . i come away from reading an issue thinking that i have been well informed
mag	a self absorbed mag that likes to pat itself on the back for feeling pity for the lower 'folks . ' they named cindy sheehan in their january 2006 best of the best issue for 'best stand ! ' they are so diluded they think that 'nut'is making an honorable stand-only by using her son 's honorable death to serve her ego ! secondly , open the edition tom ford and you will be discusted with his self-gloating , and sexist photography of women . i do n't mind nude pictures , but he only uses women-like sex objects . reese witherspoon ( highest paid actress in hollywood ) is showed holding a doll by it 's arm with an empty stare into the lens.the men are portrayed in sexual positions with the women , and the african actors portrayed are dressed in animal skins ! revolting
mag	there are two good ways to tell what audience at which a woodworking magazine is aimed . the first is the type of advertising , and the second is how much skill do the projects expect you to have . it is pretty clear right away that woodworker 's journal server home woodworkers who are already of moderate skill . the advertised 'big toys ' run in the 500 to 1500 dollar range , although there are a couple of high end combination machines in the adds as well . articles expect you to know how to use the tools of the trade but not sure about the 'best ' way to do something . a recent issue makes a study of an intarsia backed high chair with some interesting joinery , and instructions for making a genuinely exotic angle jig for a table saw . writing is solid and reasonably illustrated , but they devote little space to what you should already know , which can make these projects a stretch for a tyro . the magazine is very tool oriented . there is n't a lot of space devoted to hand tools or history . expect articles comparing nail guns and helping you decide whether stationary or bench top equipment is right for you . however , traditionally manual tasks like finishing also receive their due . i found the woodworker 's journal suited me quite well , and i expect to continue reading it
mag	i especially love this magazine because it gives details of different `` non tourist '' adventurous things to do . either with the family or by yourself . from canoeing to climbing a mountain . i recommend it for anyone who likes the outdoors and likes to live on the edge , and with this magazine you will know what most adventure-ers dont
mag	i was very disappointed with this magazine . the tech reviews have absolutely no depth to them . most articles are rather pretentious and boring . in the 5 issues i have received so far only the may 2006 issue had any thing interesting . and it only had two articles which were worth it . the first was `` robbed blind '' which was about rfid chips and the second article was `` diy ways to go green ''
mag	if oprah made a magazine and it was n't that good i would still read it but luckily she writes a great magazine and it is called o. oprah helps starving kids eat and crippled kids walk and that is the kind of neat stuff she puts in her magazine . i have to hide my copies of miss whinfrey 's magazine because my brother takes them and tears them up because does not know how great a magazine it is right fellow oprah 's magaine readsers ? ? ? ! ! ! if you want to learn to be a millionairrre with pretty dogs and have lots of people come to chicago to see you you will learn how in this magazine
mag	when i picked up a recent issue of natural home , i was pleasantly surprised . i enjoyed the magazine so very much ! if you get a chance to flip through it , and want validation for your salvage instincts and your love of great design ... .you may find it just as inspirational . from the article about adding pretty ( and smart ) shutters to the interior of a home for cold winter nights ( they go under the window treatment and help increase the r-ratings for insulating any window against the cold -- this technique has been used in other countries for centuries ) ; the use of ventilation and healthy air is already an obsession of mine ; and getting rid of clutter by thinking about things we own and the spaces we put them in a new way was refreshing . `` try this project '' appeals to the `` use it , do n't just throw it away ! '' girl in me . finally , designing the structure of a house around its usability is something that i really like . there is so much wasted space in today 's new construction ... i really do n't understand it . natural home challenges you to create something new out of what you already have ... a breathe of fresh air
mag	i like this one better than cosmo . great info on beauty and the like
mag	i subscribed to bhg from their website and ended up subscribing to an additional year . the articles are helpful to a degree but the layout of this magazine , with its overwhelming amount of advertising , takes away from any good points . i 've found the style to be choppy and very difficult to read because of the ads . it 's hard to tell how long an article is or where it starts . i rarely find anything i 'd want to save . overall a disappointment
soft	i 'm an amateur photographer and i use photoshop cs2 for most of my digital editing . i decided i needed a colorimeter based on the recommendations of many books that i have read on digital editing . i had to download an update of the software program before i could start using my spyder . this procedure alone took several hours because i kept getting `` error '' messages . i ca n't count how many times i unloaded and reloaded the program . i was eventually able to run the program , however , every time i calibrated my one year old emachine crt monitor , it left me with an orange color cast on my screen . i worked with colorvision technical support for many frustrating hours . the technical support person i was working with was very pleasant and really tried to help me . they even mailed me a new sensor because they thought the first one was defective . unfortunately i was unable to get the orange color cast removed from my monitor . after several weeks of trying to get the spyder2 express to calibrate my monitor , i gave up . i just did n't want to spend any more time trying to get it to work so it was returned . i really wanted it to work . i 'm back to using adobe gamma .
soft	i 'm 9 years old and play this game frequently . i love to play it . it 's not frustrating at all and it 's totally exciting with many adorable animals . i did n't like her wardrobe in the beginning but then i bought a dresser and changed her outfit . the pigs are fun to treat ! ! ! ! ! they 're smart ! ! the rabbits are soft and adorable ; having my favorite animal being rabbits . i play this game for at least a half an hour a day and ca n't wait for the next time playing it ! ! ! ! get this game and try it out ! ! it 's the best !
soft	i am enjoying the talk now ! learn bulgarian cd . great images , repetitive visual and auditory instruction make learning the basic words , numbers , time , etc . easy . also , the games add interest . you can print out each section with photos and words in bulgarian . however , i would have liked to see the program come with the cyrillic alphabet and pronunciation guide .
soft	i 'm currently learning how to use this product ; however , one of the first things i noticed was that the only way to do my payroll with it was to use a service . now of course , this service was n't free and with only 4 employees , the last thing i wanted to do was expend $ 20 a month on a service . was n't that the point of getting quickbooks - so i could do it myself ? now i can understand that tax codes , percentages , etc can vary from state to state , but would it have been so difficult for them to just set up a section with the generalized accounts and have the user input the amounts for each account needed on their payroll checks . see , i 'm not even asking them to have the computer calculate the amounts . simple would have been fine with me . as for the rest of the program , it looks as though it will be fairly easy to use after i figure out the best way to set it up for my particular business . i 'm disappointed that a business program designed for the small businessman would omit something as vital as payroll
soft	cd installs easily , it even comes with a nice short instructional video . once installed , zoneaalarm is fairly unobtrusive , but seems to get the job done . well-designed product
soft	i started with norton ghost 2003 many years ago and had problems backing up clone images . acronis true image backup 9.0 has a simple user interface that works well . i used it to re-image my son 's computer without any problems . it is a good product for the price . i highly recommend making a backup image of your hard drive on a weekly basis
soft	i was bought for my 13month daughtor . this is her favorite litte touch book because lulu is very friendly friend . this is worthy of money . we love it
soft	it has made my bookkeeping for my small business soooo easy . invoices in a flash , keep track of your expenses so easily . this program was the best investment and tax deductible ! very easy not complicated !
soft	my boss asked me to get this , so that he check out the latin portion of it . what a waste ! the only latin on this cd is *latin* american spanish . the interface was underwhelming . i needed to guess at what did what , because the controls are mostly icons . what 's worse , there is no menu bar at the top to help take the guess work out of using the program . apparently though , the manufacturer did throw in an extra *not* listed on the back . if you are learning the differences between us and uk english , its there ! i gave this one star , only because i could n't give it no stars
soft	my last roxio product was `` easy cd creator 5 . '' when i switched to a mac i naturally expected `` toast '' to be the mac version of this product . i am extremely disappointed to find that the crippled video editing features in my ( many years old ) version of cd creator is miles ahead of what they include with the most current and up to date version of `` toast '' which i unfortunately own . it allowed me to edit video clips , create several levels of customizable menus , customize the size of compression , and burn to a dvd which played on my standard dvd player . toast can create one uncustomizable menu level , has no editing , and locks up every time you drag a file into it . they ( in the product description ) say it reads mpegs but it 's more like it freezes every time it sees an mpeg . it does n't even read every mpeg reliably . the only thing i can find that roxio adds to toast that is n't in my old version of cd creator is more enhanced mp3 and music features ( which is n't what i bought it for ) . i may have been better off using `` parallels '' in combination with cd creator . i am sorry but compared to roxio 's cd creator ( which is basically the same price ) , toast seems to have been designed by total idiots . and i always thought that mac software was better for working with multimedia
soft	do n't think about video capture cards , going into the operating system , or even opening the computer case - just turn on the power , plug dazzle 's usb plug into your usb port , and connect the colored cords on your vcr with the same colored plugs on dazzle , install the software , and let this wonderful tool do all of the heavy lifting . excellent quality , and they will lower the quality if you want a smaller file - like , say , if you want to back-up your vcr to a cd-r . the test for quality is time - tell it to record to 70 minutes , and your work is done . i really like the fact that the software is so stable , i recorded a six hour vcr tape using a 512 meg xp machine - not a moment 's problem . they also included software that makes editing these video files real easy , if you want . that is just icing on the cake . strong , solid , silent - the john wayne of vcr to computer file translator tools . as an aside , i have held onto some vcr tapes for years , one for more than a decade , hoping something like dazzle would come along . prayers answered . just shut up and buy it
soft	i work for a software company so i know a little about the user interface concept . this is one of the worst packages i have ever used . i just spent an hour trying to draw my house and get the dimensions right . the automatic dimension builder did not work . i had to draw it , and redraw it to get the dimensions right . then i added a few windows and doors , and 2 porches . then i tried to use the camera to get a vertical view . the whole file blew up - ca n't find it anywhere . the manual is useless , and the tutorial cd is just an overview of each topic . what a waste of moeny
soft	i have been a corel user for years . this latest version is a great improvement . esp for raster to vector tracing . i have always preferred to use corel over our illustrator even though i have both installed on my system . corel just seems to be a much more user friendly program . very powerful for anyone from novice to pro user
soft	i am very happy with it but it does n't live up to my expectations . i also have the reg . plus for xp and i really do n't think the extra money is worth it . if i were to do over i would still have bought the plus superpack for xp but not the regular plus just because i do have a media center pc . if i did n't have that the regular plus for xp would have been just fine
soft	great deal , great price , great product . emedia guitar method is by far one of the greatest computer learn to play programs out there . my order netted me a brand new , factory fresh product , securely and quickly shipped . thanks , again
soft	the title of this product is a joke . it should be called `` not easy cd burning '' . roxio version 5 was much easier than this one is . it is way too complicated for burning simple cds
soft	i contacted the program 's customer service department when the cards in this program printed off center no matter what i did . i received an email saying that this was a known problem with the program and a fix would be available by the end of january . mid-february i asked again about it as there had been no fix . that time they said it would be fixed by the end of february . i 've used their previous programs w/out problems , just wanted more variety so added this one . apparently not a good idea ... ..
soft	this program is fantastic . it 's super easy to use and has a calendar that will notify you of upcoming events/holidays/etc . there are loads of pre-made cards to choose from or you can edit them to your needs . you can also make your own card without any help . the same thing for envelopes ! there are also quite a few additional projects included . you can create your own stationary sets ( paper and envelopes ) , awards and certificates , kid 's activity pages and more . i highly recommend this program if you 're a beginner card maker . i mostly bought this ( i was a beginner ) to save money on cards and in the 2 months i 've had this program , it has more than paid for itself . it 's much more convenient than going to the store , way cheaper and i really like being able to make matching envelopes .
soft	i did not think that introduction to the game was going to end . i thought that i may be able to skip it but no luck . once into the game i believe that my child was enjoying the game and seem to be learning some great skills . lastly , you have to hit the `` f '' keys and `` esc '' to save and exit the game , not many program make you do that today . overall , i feel that this was a good purchase and i would have given 5 stars if functionally was better with program
soft	never recueved the product . waiting for refund for over 6 weeks
soft	i have read several reviews and decided the spyder2pro would be a good monitor color calibrator for me . i have a samsung 970p monitor with all adjustments via software . the calibration process is very simple and all you have to do is follow the menu of questions during the calibration process . i like the spyder2pro and would recommend it highly .
soft	i have purchased this product which i run on a dual core processor under windows xp professional . software is very unstable and crashes many times when i want to open a document from a url . scansoft solution is that one should save the document in once pc and then open it up . this is of course unacceptable as this software should handle this and this is just a band-aid fix . customer service is the worst i have ever experienced and nuance/scansoft need to greatly improve this . i have submitted on various occasions emails which i never ever receive a response . when talking to customer service they promise they would get back to you and so far have never ever done so ! ! ! ! extremely unreliable service . i own many of their products and will never ever purchase another one of their products .
soft	i have used works type products for years . microsoft works 7 is the best of the lot . it will work on almost any computer in use today and is definitely a best buy at the current price
soft	i purchased the mangadebut because i wanted to dabble in tones and inking ( which i usually never do , usually i just scan in the sketch and then darken it with a photo editing . ) i came to find out that using lines and erasing the sketch makes for a much more clean finished product . of course , you could acomplish this with ms paint if you really wanted to . one of the main ( and only , in my opinion ) advantages to this program is the amazingly vast variations of tones available to make your art more interesting . that alone makes it worth the 50 dollars you put into it . one downside is that this program , because of it 's many tones , uses and requires quite a bit of space . when i uploaded it on my laptop , it slowed down significantly . so much so that now i load it when i want to finish a nice drawing and the delete it from the computer again ! xd overall it deserves about 3-4 stars . ^.^
soft	i was charged the full price of 49.95 with no $ 20 coupon inserted
soft	i bought this for my four girls . they all love it , ad are learning lots . but the quality of the graphics , characters , and even theme ( or story ) seem to be low budget . we have a lot of other educational computer games which are just fun for even me to watch ( and play ) . the overall quality in our other games is much higher . it is a lot like comparing disney cartoons to speed racer . but ... my oldest , who is 11 , still enjoys this program and has not complained about anything i write about here
soft	the features of the program are great , but it crashes way too much . my computer system is fully adequate for video editing , so that is not the problem . i 've gotten to the point where i save my work literally every minute for fear that it will crash
soft	voice recognition software continues to improve . i 've been using versions of this software since 1998 and can see significant improvements in the voice recognition technology over that period . before investing in this software , though , check carefully the specifications of your pc . the faster the processor and the more ram you have , the better the results . the software will run on the minimum specification identified , but it may not run fast enough to satisfy the needs of some us . this software is useful in many circumstances . many of us can speak faster than we can type and many of us compose as we type . the software can be used with a range of email clients as well as in word processing and other software . you can , as it claims , obtain reasonable voice recognition results with a few minutes of set up and training . but for optimal use , and the best return on investment , consider using the voice command capabilities to drive other software . this takes more effort initially but can deliver significant benefits . i 'll be buying a new pc before i look at upgrading this software . highly recommended . jennifer cameron-smit
soft	before buying quickbooks you should google : quickbooks 2007 simple start free starter edition . this free version never times out . you can immediately download 400m or get the cd with no shipping charge . the big limit in the free upgradeable version is you only get 20 total customers and vendors , so it is ideal for students and those with limited needs
soft	office 97 was a pretty good product . the programs were powerful , had a decent interface ( maybe not as good as the claris products of the early 1990s , but not bad ) , and came with a ton of features all on one disc . the office 98 release for mac was pretty much the same thing . the only thing that really got annoying for me was the office assistant ( paperclip ) but it is easy enough to turn off . office 2000 was a bit of a disappointment for me . i felt that the improvements were minimal ( aside from a bit more stability in word -- anyone who has ever used word 97 on a regular basis knows it 's prone to crashing ) and in fact detracted from the ease of use . one example is the clip gallery , which went from being one of the best organizers ever created to becoming a program that would n't have received decent reviews in 1988 . another is powerpoint 's outline feature . i always turned this off because it ate up monitor space and therefore made the actual slide smaller . when you use smaller displays like i often do this is a problem . the menus , which hide some functions until you go to the bottom of them , were also an annoyance . the manual went from being a nice thick book to one half the size . office 2003 continues making the program uglier . now there are many tasks crammed onto one little panel on the right of the screen . again , this eats into the workspace . the clip art system is even more cumbersome , and many of the clips are online only now . the help feature tries to point too much in the online direction as well . now some people may not complain , but what if you 're using a laptop in the middle of the country ? i feel that the program is basically an uglier version of the same thing that was first seen in 1997 . in fact , the 1997 version was more pleasant to work with and almost as powerful . on my macs , i 've switched to keynote for presentations and pages for some of my word processing because the new office versions on that platform are similar . some of the templates also look very 1997 . apple 's programs are updated on a regular basis , and their templates look very modern . now i know microsoft adds some new ones now and then , but they should consider redesigning many of them -- such as replacing the overused arial and times new roman fonts with something a little more classy . the program is bloated way too heavily . i can run office 2000 comfortably on a 486 with sub-1gb hard drive , but ca n't even get 2003 on it . a final gripe is that access is not user friendly at all . file maker is a better alternative , as it is easier to use and friendlier
soft	i bought this item because my husband heard is the best internet security . now i regret buying one . since ive installed it , it slowed my computer , its very very hard to close window and worse when i disconnected from the internet i have a hard time logging off . everytime im on the internet , i get mad and upset . its not worth all the stress . i definitely dont recommend this product . now im trying to figure how i can return the product and go back to norton
soft	i was very happy with my quickbooks basics . but for whatever corporate reason they no longer support the basics version , so i was forced to upgrade to pro 2007 . it is much slower than basics , it 's more complicated to back-up ( it asks so many questions ) , also it takes longer to print a simple check ( again too many clicks before it prints ...
soft	this program causes my computers to blue screen . trend micro has been contacted twice , but have not responded
soft	i loved the 2006 version of this software , but when i received an email offering an `` upgrade '' to the 2007 version , i decided to improve what i had . i could not be more disappointed . the resulting product is a miserable failure and i 'm amazed that some people are having good luck with it . this version prints everything off center . i can play with some of it to center it , but not the hallmark logo , etc. , on the back . the result is a very unprofessional mess . i went online to report the problem saw they have a faq on the issue promising that `` soon '' they will have a `` fix '' i can download . three months later and still no `` fix '' . i 've written nova 3 times , they acknowledge the problem and issue the same automated response `` keep checking for updates '' . finally , after numerous emails and phone conversations they have agreed to let me return the software to them . when i received the 2007 edition , which in every other way was virtually identical to the 2006 version , i threw away my old software . i 'm now thinking of purchasing it again because i found this software easy to use and loved to be able to make so many changes , add photos , etc . maybe some of these do n't have this technical problem , but just be warned
soft	extremely difficult to unistall . endless loop . do not buy this product or if you do then be prepared for an exremely fustrating experience . i will never use nav again
soft	please see reviews of the previous version 7.0 . the adobe activation process can cause a lot of continuing problems for legitimate users of this software . too bad such good software is hampered by such a process . being in the software business , i do n't mind companies worrying about piracy and taking some measures but this is a bit too much . you might need to allow the software to access the internet regularly to keep your activation ( and not bother you with notices of reactivation ) but that also means you open it for adobe to do their push marketing into their software . i have used adobe products for over 15 years and have always liked them . too bad , they have lost the customer focus in their rage for software piracy and greed for intrusive marketing
soft	i 'm an old school comic book collectors and i bought this in order to see what the technology has done with the print page . this is more about collecting the stories than it is about collecting the art -- and i still find there 's no substitute for the feel of those magical pages
soft	kudos microsoft . my last go around with encare was with the 2004 version . at that time the program had a cluttered clusmey interface . the various modules were n't intuitive or intergrated and it was therefore , confusing and not partuiclarly user friendly . the new interface is quite simple but very powerful . it is well integrated with the web and therefore capable of constant updating . perfect for the student and anyone who likes to research topics . if you have not tried encarta in a while , check it out , there is much to like .
soft	i got norton ghost with my new dell pc , so i thought i would use it for backups to an external usb drive . after about 6 months of 'trying ' to use it , i finally gave up and uninstalled it . reason , most of the backups somehow get corrupted and the software seems to have trouble working with it . twice i removed all the partial backups and started from scratch , but again after a few weeks the backup agent would hang while doing an incremental backup . now , the software is good for making a complete clone of the hard disk or restoring system from an image , but it does not seem to work well with incremental backups
soft	this program does what it says . it does limit you to only 3 loadings of the product on your computer , so if you have more than 3 computers you have to buy another program
soft	used this for a trip from nw of chicago to houghton , mi ( in the u.p . ) and it worked fairly well except through some hilly sections ( lost signal a few times ) . this works best when you have two people ( driver and navigator ) as looking over at a laptop while driving is n't a good thing ! would have been even better with voice prompts but at the price i would n't expect it
soft	everyone uses office . everyone is familiar with office . so why did ms change the interface to make it nearly impossible to get anything done ? i am computer savy ( i 'm an engineer ) and i find the new ribbon interface totally infuriating . worst of all there is no way to go back to the `` old '' drop down menu system . it honestly takes me 10x the time to get anything done with word/powerpoint because they 've buried functionality behind these ridiculous ribbons . ms claims that you will be able to be much more productive once you 're familiar with the ribbons . i do n't know/care whether that 's true or not . the learning curve to get to the point of fluency with their new ui is immense . so much so that the time investment to become proficient far far far out ways any `` increase '' in productivity ... .not to mention that it 's overpriced . offce 2003 is a far superior product
soft	after years of using symantec norton antivirus and related internet security products , the upgrade to 2007 seemed like a no brainier . that was until the install started . if you run into error 9999,171 you may as well give up , it is over . following the symantec directions for resolution of the dreaded 9999,171 error caused the entire windows xp install to be corrupt and necessitated reinstallation . believing that a reinstall was not all bad as it would clean up several old and no longer used software pieces and provide a clean base for installing symantec i marched forward . once xp was installed and current with the patches it was time to install symantec again . no luck , i was still receiving the 9999,171 error . now it was time to get someone on the phone for support . this is a good trick since symantec does not readily publish a phone number for support . the number by the way is 877-832-2810 . be prepared for a long wait on hold . during four support calls i experienced no less that 40 minutes on hold and the longest was over one hour . support is provided by offshore resources in india so not only are you fighting a technical problem you must also overcome the language barrier . the four separate calls to support resulted in multiple steps to clean up old installs , prep for install , reboot , reinstall , hack through the registry , and oh yah corrupt windows xp again needing a second reinstall . during the final call , the support rep finally gave up and indicated the symantec could not be installed on this windows xp machine . i have since moved on to mcafee internet security suite 2007 . the install took about ten minutes and i am now up and running again .
soft	version 7 installed without a hitch and has increased the productivity of my business because it also works much better than version 5
soft	i used paint shop pro to help build my website . i really like it and i 'm glad i bought it . my favorite part about it is the animation software . you can do great animation or cool banners or even little buttons with cool effects . because of psp 9 my website now has animation , buttons and a banner with bright colors and images ! i love it ! and anyone can use it ! i had no experience with psp or computer art and graphics , but this is pretty simple to use . also you can use psp for touching up and doing other neat things with your photographs . this is great software for doing all this stuff and it 's so much cheaper than photoshop . if you 're building a website and want to add color and graphics or if you want do to some photo touch up work , then maybe you want to check out paint shop pro
soft	this is another great card making product but i do n't believe as good as hallmark . but ? i still use it a whole lot and love it ! i know you will too ! try it out ! and take a chance on a great product
soft	if you have a mac , and are having difficulties with this dvd , here are some tips . are you opening it with preview ? if you just click on the icon on the disk , it will open in preview ... but this will not work properly . you must use adobe reader to see the pages without the watermark . install adobe reader from the dvd . make an alias of adobe reader and put it in the dock . click and open the dvd icon . click and open the decade folder . do n't open the year folder ... click and drag the pdf icon , ( such as ff_1960.pdf ... i have the fantastic four dvd , so substitute whatever is appropriate ) , onto the reader alias in the dock to open . click on year . click on month . click on the magnifing glass icon to zoom to any size . i hope this is helpful
soft	well presented , easy to follow along , and easy to revisit previous lessons . videos and illustrated fretboard really help see and hear how the song should be played . not a lot of depth in the material but probably about the right level to maintain the attention of most students . some of the accompanyment/singing could be better but overall does a good job presenting the music so the student can practice along . some of the material/songs may not be to everyones liking , but again , these are okay for the beginner . the singing can be a slight destraction sometimes . i probably would n't recommend this to be the only source of learning guitar ... .and i do n't think most people buying it would think it 's all the will every need to become a great guitar player . i 'm sure a teacher would still be very advantageous especially when it comes to pointing out bad habits that may creep into the new students technique . i 'm trying to learn without a teacher as well and have found other music books very useful . bottom line ; this is a good product and provides a good start at learning to play the guitar .
soft	i really dislike this software . i 'm the type that likes to customize everything and this program just is not made that way . first , when you initially select files and folders , your disk choices are `` c : '' or `` all '' . i have several disks and i want to pick and choose , but this program makes that really difficult . then you have to pick a destination where the files will be backed up . choose carefully , because you wo n't be allowed to change it later ! and if you want to do incremental backups , be sure to schedule it before you do the initial save , because you ca n't do it later . basically the entire job , future backups and all , must be defined completly at the beginning and can never be changed without completely starting over .
soft	i am new at researching my family history . the v16 collector 's ed of family tree maker was just what i needed . as an extra bonus it has a 1 yr. subscription to [ ... ] to enhance the research capabilities . i would definitely recommenend this program
soft	i was very pleased to discover all of the data packed into this program . setting up the query parameters is easy the amount of info concerning places of interest ( services , banks , transportation ) is substantial . about the only drawback i found was the quality of the help contents , which was not very user friendly . most of the time i was unable to find solutions to my question/problem because the data was way too complicated ( displaying data in technical equations ) or was not listed at all . however , calls to technical support usually resolved the questions . finally , i was disappointed that the program does not allow you to print written legends off to the side on your map ( ie : a listing of addresses for your push pin locations ) . other than that , the program is very handy , loaded with tons of great data the quality of the maps is superior .
soft	it was a relief for me to be able to keep and upgrade word and excel , and to get virtual pc ( for access ) as well . i used them a lot on my pc a few years ago , and when i first switched to mac , could n't find software that did what they did . i had no trouble installing the upgrade on my imac g5 , nor did i have trouble installing virtual pc . the only thing that was disappointing was that i could n't find out whether accessing the internet from virtual pc would open me up to pc-type viruses , or if mac 's unix system would protect me there , too . i continue to be disappointed that the mac version of this software is not as rich as the pc version . but the upgrade itself worked well for what it was meant to do
soft	i ca n't even comment on the actual system works application because i never got it to run - it ruined my system right after install ! once i installed it , it asked for a reboot , then came back wtih `` load error ! press a key to reboot ... '' which just lead to the error message again , and again , and again . a chat with tech support ( after an hour wait ) revealed that there are problems with the goback files , so i had to create a bootable cd , and do all kind of things which i have n't been able to do yet since my burner software does n't have image capability - necessary for creating this bootable cd . do n't buy it , do n't install it , do n't use it - uninstall everything norton/symantec and never go back . i 'll be lucky if i ever get my computer working again ... ..thanks symantec ! ! ! !
soft	excellent product . the 'over $ 450 value ' might be a bit overstated but the packages is still an excellent value . during installation , the 1 year free trial to [ ... ] showed up as a 30 day trial but was resolved quickly through familytreemaker.com support and a subsequent call to ancestry.com support . ancestry.com provided a 1 year free trial to their us deluxe product over the phone and did n't ask for a credit card number for renewal . to me , that 's a sign that they 're a reputable company . some of the additional software in the package is buried on the installation cd but is worth the extra manual effort to find and install - especially the gensmart software .
soft	i purchased the upgrade since i 'd already bought both office v.x and virtual pc 6.1 last year . the biggest letdown is that microsoft 's promised support for the g5 is nearly non-existent . i have a dual processor g5 with an ati radeon 9800 card ( apple ) , and after trying to install virtual pc 7 three times , i can not get a vm to work . it did install ( and work ) flawlessly on my g4 powerbook . googling for reviews finds it 's very hit or miss , but if ( when ) it misses , you 'll regret investing the extra $ $ $ in an immature product
soft	my daughter and another second-grade friend both got bored of this game after 20 minutes of staring at a horse standing in a stall and listening to a cat meow . the controls are not very logical , and there is no animation to speak of
soft	challenging and fun . graphics a fair compared to the mindless flashy video games . educational value is exellent , challenging and helps develop speed as well as accuracy . the challenge of having to think and get the right math answer in order to advance makes the games more challenging than the flashey graphic video games . if the animation was similar to the flashy video game adventures ( ie : jak 3 or ratchett and clank ) it might make it too hard because of all the distractions and tools obtained . it might be interesting if that level of graphics and animation was worked into the game . the younger kids may be better able to intergrate a multi-tooled , multi-level , multi-directional with more mapping and varied spatial orientation than older people . my eight year old was able to gain more speed quicker on the game than i was
soft	despite generally good experiences with microsoft products , windows live onecare seems to have resulted in very poor performance on a brand new lenovo pc running windows xp . i removed it and performance has improved back to where it was , now running mcafee for virus scanning etc
soft	i did n't use this particular product but the version that came with my computer which was slow but not the end of the world . the problem i had with them is that they aoutomatically renew your subscription without giving any warning that they are going to do it . i had a 2-year subscription and they send me an e-mail 2 years later saying they charged my account with never telling me that i was in auto enrollment ! when i called to complain they of course had someone who could n't inderstand me and i had to spell my e-mail address three times and was told it would take 3-5 days for the refund to be processed which is crap because i work for an online store and its easier to void a sale and cheaper for the vendor to do a refund the same day ! i asked for a manager twice , the second time they came back they had the nerve to ask me if i was interested in an upgrade and subscribing to their magazine , and was put on the never-ending hold until i gave up 37 minutes later which was probably the plan all along . so i called my bank and put a stop payment on the automatic payment . now i am searching for another protection program and calling their customer service before my purchase to see how it goes
soft	i have used taxcut and turbotax on and off for years . turbotax tends to have less problems . this year taxcut was incredibly difficult . first it would not properly import the data from deductionpro . then the tier one tech support gave me outright incorrect information . finally tier two support gave me the link to the custom patch that allowed me to import the data . also , when i received the taxcut email that the irs had accepted my return i logged on to taxcut to check status and get my declaration control number . taxcut would not recognize that i had efiled and would not check for the dcn . i had to call support for about the 5th time and after some time on the phone they discovered they could access the dcn and gave it to me over the phone . because of these delays i have still not finished with the state return . i do n't know if i will buy this product again .
soft	i find turbo tax to be the original and best income tax preparation program . i really saddened to hear people knock it on here because they felt cheated that this version does n't come with state tax features . well , if you are going to shop online , you 'd better learn to read the specifications for products ! i came to amazon precisely because i knew i 'd be able to find what i needed , for less . texas has no state income tax , so i make sure that i buy turbo tax for federal only . thanks for letting me get that little rant off my chest
soft	i thought this would be a good product for my computer . i did n't know that the only way to receive this product is over the internet via download . during the process the prompts for the internet download ask you to remove ( uninstall/delete ) all of your known antivirus , spyware , and firewalls from your computer prior to install . this leaves your computer susceptible when you receive an error message . i received an error message that prevented me from completing the download . i purchased the software on aug 3 and called customer support , they researched the problem and even took remote access of my computer to try and fix the issue . they were unable to do so and then passed me to the second level of computer technicans . microsoft guards its secrets well and has varying levels of technical support , those that know the basics and those that know more . they asked me to set up a time span when i would like to receive a call from the `` teir ii '' agents , i chose 6-9pm . i received several calls over the next two weeks , all of them were outside of the specified time . i missed several of them because i have a career and a life . when i finally spoke with an agent they again took over remote access of my computer and were also unable to solve the issue . here it was , two weeks after i purchased the software , i still did not have what i needed . i was also unable to surf the web because the download process requires you to delete all antivirus and firewall software . i called in several times druing the ordeal and the `` teir i '' agents just told me that i have to wait for the call , `` they 'll get to it when they get to it . '' i was very upset with the customer support , i have no idea how the product is , but the customer support is just horrible . go to the windows live onecare home page and search for the `` post your own thoughts '' page through member accounts , you 'll see that i 'm not alone in this issue . i have since purchased other software that cover what microsoft says it will with onecare . i did not have one problem with these installs . please be aware that you might have to purchase technical support if you can not download due to a problem with your operating system ( seperate from onecare ) . this costs an additional $ 35 ontop of the cost for onecare
soft	this is the second generation of this software i have owned . it is a great navagation tool , better than most online sites and can be used in the car . i marvel at how up to date the roads shown are because in the lexington , kentucky area we have had a lot of new growth , with new streets and roads . the software contains a lot of good eating and lodging places already placed on the map , so you do n't have to do a separate search to find a place to eat or spend the night . major points of interest are also on the map
soft	the rosetta stone language software was a great investment . the product provides learning words together with listening , seeing , and hearing or the user can select one of these individually or even practice writing words and phrases . it provides an easy to use interface and you can learn at your own pace . the product has been worth it 's hefty price . i do recommend purchasing a german/english dictionary to accompany the software . i have also had in the past a basic german 101 course prior to using rosetta stone , so it may be difficult to start for a person with no knowledge of the german language , such as pronunciation of basic words or greetings
soft	you will probably be more productive and less bug ridden if you stick with what you have . 15 years of outlook and you ca n't print a single address label or an envelope with one click .

soft	thats really my only complaint with this game , every time you buy a racing game the cars all seem to be the same . being in australia , we had our own fast cars , the falcon gtho phase 111 , the hk monaro gts and who could forget the torana gtr/xu1 , ok this might mean nothing to someone over in the usa or england . but they where supercars in their day , that said its still a great game for all petrol heads old and young a lik
soft	i was required to purchase this with my new computer . i thought i 'd give it a chance at work . we have a dedicated wired network , which just requires that you register the machine 's mac address with our dhcp server . nice and simple , and very much like the lan in any home where the user has a nat router . i plugged in the network and tried to get the mac address . vista would only give me the wizard to connect my network . ok , i tried the wizard . it offers to let me setup pppoe with a username and password . that 's it , no other options . i asked for other options , and it only offered that i use a modem ( that i did not have in my computer . ) no options for a dedicated network at all , that i could find . i went to another machine ( on the 'net ) and searched google . none of the microsoft sites were helpful in any way . lots of pr posturing , but no useful information or troubleshooting . i gave up , found the license and install disks for windows xp , and downgraded the new machine . it was far , far easier .
soft	i am not a professional reviewer or a tech guru , but based on my experience with this product i am very satisfied . i love the new interface and how easy it is to work with documents and apply formatting with such ease . i have only used it for a month now and i still have to use some of the applications yet . if you have the money and will love to have a new office suite that can give you some happiness working with documents every day , go for it
soft	having a study bible on my palm pilot has been very helpful . whenever i had some down time i always wished i had my bible . now i do at all times . it is easy to navigate . takes up a good amount of memory so just be prepared , but if you have enough memory on a card in your palm , it works great . i have used the memorize help feature a lot as well for memorizing verses . great product !
soft	i have been using paperport since it came from my visioneer scanner for about 9/10 years and since then upgraded a few versions . after reading hyped-up product features of version 11 from nuance website , i can not justify upgrading my paperport software to pro given its current cost . i am pretty sure that a lot more people ( especially loyal users like me ) would snap it up if it was little cheaper . i will probably wait for some time for price to go down ... . it will also need time to stabilize ( no patches yet ! ! ! ) and become compatible with vista . for those of you who got lotsa money ( please send me some ) , i would recommend paperport as a decent doc managment s/w
soft	i agree with reviewer mr. dietz . i was eager for my child to learn chess and we bought this new on amazon for $ 24.99 . put it in and loaded it in . this game is so confusing and there are no instructions at all . no help menu either . we wasted at least 2 hours on it before i ejected it and apologized to her . there is nothing here to learn chess from
soft	this dictionary is not for the person who english is his second language . it does not have enough sentence examples to let you know how to use each entry word . in addtion , the micro does n't work well with ms word .
soft	seems to do the trick . i do n't use it personally but mom likes it
soft	worked as expected . a few hardware glitches but that was to be expected
soft	a good product but like a lot of microsoft releases , not everyone outside of microsoft is ready for it . check with your web hosting service first to be sure they support sites developed with expression web . that is a problem i have run into . in fact some hosting services that support front page , have n't even come to full support of front page 2003 let alone expression web . you could end up changing hosting services to take full advantage of this product and its features
soft	i think this product is highly overated and this claim of being 99 % accurate is false . once in while it can amaze you by typing a sentence with 100 % accuracy , but this enthusiasm is quickly dashed when you realise that the very next sentence is complete gibberish which bears absolutely no relation to what you said and you wonder how it could have possibly interpeted what you have in that manner . i think this program maybe accent sensitive so that a person with an american accent may get good results while a person with a british or an australian accent may get poor results for the same level of training . in summary i think the program is unreliable with an accuracy of 45 % at its present level of developement . it has plenty of potential and with future developement it could much more reliable but at its present level of developement i think the performance is mediocre .
soft	it does the basic job well . the calibration runs smoothly and accurately . hardware looks and feels solid . my two completely different brand , size and age crt monitors ended up with exactly the same colors sitting side by side . user interface is merely adequate . pop up help instructions are better than many i have seen . you will need to know already how the calibration buttons on your monitors work ( the hardwired buttons on the monitor , not software ) . in order to make any edits you must run the entire time consuming calibration over . sometimes you can use `` back '' within the calibration , sometimes you must start over . also the separate `` profile chooser '' utility software , has not add or delete profile feature - even if it is a profile created and saved by the calibration software earlier . you can see it with windows display properties , but it may not appear in the profile chooser list . dual monitors is the one obvious reason to choose pro over plus version . yes , it does dual monitors , but with an asterisk . it will create separate profiles , but will only apply the correct profiles automatically at startup to both monitors if you have two separate video cards . if you have a single video card with dual outputs , it will load the same profile ( the last one you created ) to both monitors at startup . this quirk is documented in a readme file on the installation disk ( and blames windows for the problem ) , but this limitation appears nowhere in advertising material , catalogs , or on the box . fortunately there is a work around ( not documented ) at least with my particular video card and running xp . after windows opens , you can run profile chooser then choose the correct profile for each monitor . you may have to use windows display properties settings to specify default profile and rerun the calibration to get the profiles you want to appear in profile chooser and to select the correct profile as default . once it 's all set up , running profile chooser is a four of five click procedure , but you must rememeber to check it before using any application that uses color profiles . and check it after you open the application . i 've had them change after opening photoshop - though not every time .
soft	quickbooks lives up to it 's reputation of being the one-size-fits-all small business book keeping software . it does what you want it to do . i like the feature of being able to easily sent e-mail invoices . if you need the software right away it is just as cheap at the office supply stores
soft	this software was easy to install . the terms and conditions of use are very clearly stated . i found the choice of difficulty levels greatly enhanced the product and challenged me . the puzzles are fun and the techniques required to play are easily understood . my one wish is that there were more varied games included ... . but it is a lot of fun and is definitley challenging..
soft	the engine behind this program is from chief architect , who , from what i understand , are developers of professional cad software . it shows in this program . while this program has one of the best 3d walk around and capabilities , i tend to judge this and others by the drawing tools that it possesses . and this one has some good usable tools . like most consumer level landscaping programs , this one has photo import so you can design around an actual photo of your home . unlike other programs , the bhg software allows you to import and mask your own plant images . this is a great feature that my own program has which gives much better visualization with plants you might actually use . all the important stuff that we need to create a sellable visual landscape is there . for now , and with the choices i know of that are available to you , i find this to be the best consumer level landscape and garden program out there . this design software comes with an easy to understand tutorial cd . it was easy to install and start using right away . i think most folks would do quite well with this one .
soft	i purchased this product needing to work on a personal legal ( nonbusiness ) matter , so the noncommercial license was fine for my `` home '' use . good thing i checked with corel after buying it and seeing the `` home edition '' captions not only on the total suite packaging but underneath the `` wordperfect '' and `` quattro pro '' components ( inside front box folding cover with velcro ) . corel ultimately confirmed to me that `` certain components that are designed for the business customer , such as legal tools , metadata removal , document compare , quickfinder to name a few are not included in the home edition version . '' corel needs to make this clearer in their marketing of the `` home edition . '' i focused on the word processing application , but the quattro pro application is also captioned as `` home edition '' so it may be missing some features available in the quattro pro included in other suite versions ( standard , pro , student/teacher , etc. ) . the home edition may still be suitable for some users , but i 'm a strong believer in `` full disclosure . '' wordperfect itself is a great program . try setting point sizes with decimals in word -- you ca n't . try changing the size of the font in legal pleadings in word -- there 's no direct control of it ( the microsoft site instructs you to change margins and number of lines per page to attempt to get word to adjust the font size ) [ but remember , you need any wordperfect version other than home edition to get legal tools ]
soft	i have used wordperfect and quattro almost from their inception , so i have seen both of them improve over many years . those years of practise have resulted in wordperfect office x3 , a really outstanding product . because many other organizations and people that i work with use ms word and ms excel , in the past i have had no choice but to grudingly use them in response . now , however , wordperfect and quatropro can translate word and excel , incoming and outgoing . therefore , i no longer have to maintain two office programs . many years of using wp office have probably prejudiced me , but i find it more user friendly than ms office ; however , the biggest difference is that corel is responsive and helpful whereas ms is almost impossible to deal with
soft	contrary to the other review , they did ship the proper 3 user version . however , since installing it yesterday it is consuming 100 % of my systems resources and i can not find any setting to have it stop . evidently it does continuous deep virus scans so you might as well toss your computer in the garbage . what a mess of a product .
soft	microsoft office can be handy to have . the files you can open , edit and create with it ( most notably .doc , .xls , and .ppt ) are probably the closest to universal compatibility among all your high quality options . it 's ( relatively ) intuitive . it has a pretty broad array of useful functions . it 's also obscenely expensive , considering the fact that you can get all of these things -- .doc , .xls , and .ppt ; intuitive interface ; and functionality -- for free . i hunted up openoffice two years ago when i decided several hundred dollars was an insane price to pay for the ability to write papers , make basic presentations , or put together spreadsheets . i was looking for basic functionality , but i was pleasantly surprised ; openoffice does most of the neat tricks , too . ( actually , it has a neat trick microsoft can never replicate : it 's open source , so it can respond to the needs of individual users . you just say `` add this neat trick ! '' and someone will likely be able to do it for you . ) it is possible that microsoft office has some killer feature you absolutely must have that openoffice does n't . but considering the price differential , i would n't splurge on this before checking .
soft	i enjoy researching various subjects simply out of intellectual curiosity and find encarta a useful tool . i 'm somewhat overwhelmed by the multimedia offerings but like the chronological updates and appreciate this treatment of current events .
soft	i am very happy with it but it does n't live up to my expectations . i also have the reg . plus for xp and i really do n't think the extra money is worth it . if i were to do over i would still have bought the plus superpack for xp but not the regular plus just because i do have a media center pc . if i did n't have that the regular plus for xp would have been just fine
soft	this is a good product , except it keeps shutting down when i have my outlook or when i have a web page open . my main goal for an antivirus would be to run when i search the web or get in new emails ! what good is it if it shuts down when these are open ! it did find a trojan on my first scan . this was one that norton missed . i will be getting nod32 soon . sorry this product did not work for me ! it was very easy to use
soft	i just bought and installed this cd with the hopes of learning some haitian creole , and i , too , could n't find it . there is absolutely nothing on the installation cd that mentions either haiti or creole ... except the jewel case which insists it 's there . i 'm so dissapointed i have n't actually tested anything else out : i consider this a very bad start
soft	the layout of office 2003 is better than office 2003 , which has improved my efficiency . for those who spend all day working with the outlook package , it 's worth the money to upgrade
soft	this is my first review but i just felt compelled to tell everyone about this terrific program . i bought this game when my children were in kindergarten and second grade . fritz and chester 's program is so engaging . there are rhymes and chants for each piece 's moves as well as for some other `` strategy-type '' moves . for example , `` a knight on the rim is ugly and dim . '' what a great way to teach kids to keep their knights in-play ! this program teaches kids how pieces move and some simple strategies . i would recommend getting fritz and chester 2 now since you are going to get it after your kids learn to play ! my boys both joined chess teams when they were in first and third grade . their use of this computer game gave them the advantage to win several chess games in tournaments . fritz and chester 2 is also great and my boys , now in third and sixth grade , still play it
soft	i started with elements 3 and thought it worked great . i have elements 4 and can see it got better .
soft	i bought this package because i wanted good , high-compression universally accessible documents and images for my personal web page . ( google werbos ) . finally , after zillions of googles on compression technology and trying many other things ( see my other reviews ) , i found something that really , really works well , in a highly flexible and controllable way ! what a relief ! much better than acrobat 6.0 , and other packages i have tried and reviewed . the key capability lies in the `` save as '' command , which includes `` optimized pdf '' as one of the file types . the `` settings '' there gives you the power to choose jbig2 and jpeg2000 compression , the very best formats for black and white or color scanned images or papers . and of course , as pdf , they are easy for anyone to read . an example : two weeks ago , the world 's top empirical nuclear physicist , in japan , sent me a set of 24 1-meg jpegs for a 24-page paper . nothing i had would read it , except microsoft digital image , which let me fix the pages and crop them ; in adobe 6.0 , they ended up being a readable 14 meg document . no better . i printed it out at work , and scanned in the result at 400 dpi to a good modern copier/scanner . it ended up 5 megabytes . ( the copier was modern and `` intelligent '' . ) then , at home , in adobe 6 , it would optimize it to pdf version 6 , a nice 2.6 megabyte file . today , i got it to 940 k ( and better quality , to the eye ) in acrobat 8.0 , in a controllable predictable way . i had previously tried many , many other options ( including lots of microsoft programs , all options ) . if i understand what i have seen ... i could have used acrobat 8.0 directly , without all that printout and scan nonsense ! the direct control in the `` save as '' command gets rid of the need to do all that . what 's more , i just reduced a 3.5 meg file ( from the best previous material ) to 1.02 megs . ( as best i recall , i used cvision before and only got that file to 1.5-2 megs . acrobat 8.0 seems to be doing much better . ) if you google a lot on compression and comparisons , you will see some small advantage of cvision over older versions of adobe image capture and acrobat . but that 's misleading . in acrobat 6.0 , i could n't get to that better compression . ( maybe if i had a phd in adobe , i could , but i tried hard.. ) . with 8.0 , it was easy . and the results are better than cvision now , so far as i can tell . i certainly see no value at all in the new xps formats microsoft is touting , with vista , now that something so much better is available . one caveat : published benchmarks say that the djvu format may be better yet . i did not consider it , partly because of cost , but more because everyone knows how to get the latest pdf reader but djvu might stop people going to my web page . but if google books popularizes it , i might reconsider djvu . but then again ... knowing what lies behind djvu.. we might figure out something even better ... eventually ... and maybe the future pdf standards will open to that !
soft	it 's a useful tool . combined with another norton 's products ghost , you can easily perform pc maintanence using these tools
soft	i enjoy using encarta 2007 and can relie upon their information . i use it in conjunction with britannica 2007 to get the most well rounded information . i do prefer the interface and ease to britannica 2007 but the quality of information on britannica is always to be trusted . my advice you need to buy both
soft	this roxio software has caused me the most bizarre and frustrating experience ever . first , it does n't work . second , i can not obtain any support from roxio to find out why . they wo n't give support until you register , the only way to register is to follow a web link that comes with the software , and it takes you to a website that either does n't exist , or is always down . thus , it turns out to be a complete waste of money , not to mention several hours of time . run , do n't walk away from this software and this company
soft	norton is still the 800lb . gorilla of antivirus software , but i think more and more people are realizing that bigger does not mean better ! the old days when peter norton made an excellent antivirus program are long gone , and these days norton is just a mass produced product of symantec 's . customer service is through an internet database , and you must pay over $ 40 just to speak with someone even when norton lets you down and lets a virus slip in . the biggest problem is that this program is a huge hog of system resources . it is no wonder that the ratings are so poor on norton these days . i bought trend micro 's pc-cillin and have not looked back . there product is less expensive and includes free phone support , and they have received all sorts of awards for their product
soft	i really love this bible . even for someone who is well-versed in bible scripture , this adds a new dimension to your understanding . i purchased one for myself and liked it so much that i purchased one for my mom for mother 's day .
soft	i 'm sure it 's a good product for beginners , but i already had an older version of quickbooks ( from 1995 ) and the only way i could export/import the old data into a newer version of quickbooks was with qb pro . simple start does n't allow you to import data from older versions
soft	the software was just what i expected and very useful to me when creating publisher documents that need to be emailed to clients .
soft	i 've used ms streets and trips for years with minor problems . this year i upgraded to a windows vista laptop and wanted the latest software for it . i have a gps and i use a pocket pc pda so i need pocket streets . after i got home i read the fine print on the box . it list support for no higher than the windows xp os . but , so far the program is running fine on my vista machine . the laptop has no serial com ports and s 2007 wo n't detect a usb port . the description of s 2007 which includes a gps indicates it uses a usb port but apparently it needs the included usb adaptor . i could not locate where i could purchase such an adapter . s 2007 no longer ships with pocket streets . nor could i locate where i could download a copy . i can ( for now ) use my old pocket streets program because 2007 does export pocket street maps . finally , within two miles of my home the map list an airport and runway that was shut down in the early 90 's . the main highway a few blocks from me has only 3 exits in 2 miles yet s 2007 list over a dozen intersections which means when i get directions i always end up down a dead-end road . i 've purchase many versions of streets and trips and this is the first time i felt i 've wasted my money . open software ca n't be returned from where i purchased it . i guess i 'll have to start researching other software packages .
soft	the definitions and thesaurus cross referencing are very good . the user interface is quite honestly shameful . software companies got away with this years ago , but there are now accepted standards for windows user interfaces ( e.g keyboard short cuts are missing ) . integration with word 2003 is weak . numerous bugs and exceptions and very slow
soft	i should have ordered thru amazon to avoid the confusion , since they state the vercsion needed , but where i ordered from did not mention the 5.5 version requirement , and on the box cover , there is no stipulation about this , only a generic statement that a previous version is required . how hard would it be for them to print on the box what versions will and will not work ? ? ? ? ? ? adobe customer service would not budge , so i am returning the product . of course , christmas is ruined for the person i bought this for , and i am out shipping and handling charges . thank you adobe . obviously , i ca n't recommend anyone buy from adobe at this point . it 's easy to see why warez are popular when companies are this foolish
soft	i have used a few other genealogy products and this is the best so far . i am a novice and for me family tree is easy to use and has a lot more features than roots magic . the initial cost was more but the extras included made it a better value
soft	i bought this to upgrade my previous version of mcafee total protection . the first install was on a laptop , when it configured the wireless security it actually made changes to my wap setup without notifying me . first of all it said that i did n't have any security set up on the wireless connection ( although i have it set up with disabled ssid , mac filtering , wpa protection ... ) , and after it was done it had changed the setup to wep ... also causing my other wireless pcs ( that do n't have mcafee ) and my xbox 360 to no longer connect to the network ... so i ended up deinstalling that part . second pc : regular desktop , after installing the software ( only select pieces : antivirus , firewall , spamkiller , privacy service ) my multimedia sharing to the xbox 360 no longer worked . contacting mcafee support never yielded any usable response ( 'reinstall ' seems to be the default answer ... ) . deinstalling/reinstalling did n't help , opening up the firewall did n't help , etc . etc . so i ended up reverting back to my old version of mcafee . i consider myself a power pc user , i 've set up and configured dozens of pcs over the years , built my own pc , and i can honestly say that i have never used software worse than this one . i hardly ever write reviews , but i had to write this one . be warned ! maybe mcafee will eventually get its act together , but for me it 's time to move on . one last comment : this mcafee software ( just like prior versions btw ) takes up a lot of resources - several services need to run that take up a considerable amount of memory ) . not good if you do n't have ample memory
soft	there are issues regarding hardware incompatibility w/ specific components of the toshiba satellite m45-s355 . the hardware incompatibility issues w/ the dvd-ram drive , the gl910 chipset , and the soundmax integrated audio drivers are known to both microsoft technical service personnel and their counterparts at toshiba . i spent an hour of fruitless time on a conference call with technicians from both companies ( both of whom spoke what could loosely be descibed as `` english '' ) . the amazon representative with whom i spoke was in new delhi . i ultimately figured out ( on my own ) which toshiba drivers needed to be downloaded ( again consuming hours of download time with a 56k modem ) , and i used an iomega cd-rom usb external drive to load the software after about six extremely aggravating hours . i was able to avoid similar pitfalls when attempting to install small business accounting 2006 . do n't buy these products unless you absolutely must . microsoft 's `` technical service '' is a euphemism more aptly meaning `` technically useless '' . there is nothing technically professional about the additional capabilities of microsoft xp professional . i should also mention that both the toshiba laptop and the software were purchased from amazon

soft	first , if you 're thinking about using these photos for print , you may wish to think again . most objects run between 300-600 pixels in width or height , or 1-2 inches at 300 dpi . stretch them bigger than that , and they 'll start to blur and/or get jagged . also note , that if you try to export/save an image from the hemera image browser and select the 300 dpi setting , the browser may stretch the graphic larger than it 's actual size , causing blurring and jaggedness right out of the gate . you need to use the `` use image 's full size '' checkbox when exporting images . if you specify a 300 dpi size , and do n't use that checkbox , you 'll get a stretched image . for example , the first image in the collection ( the pocket watch ) is only 384 pixels wide . if you specify 300 dpi and do n't check the `` use image 's full size '' box , the software will stretch it to 642 pixels wide . the stretching will cause the image to look fuzzier and/or more jagged when you use it in a web site or print project . all that said , if you 're going to use the images for the web , they 're great . you get almost all the images you 'd find in their three `` photo objects '' collections , each of which is much more expensive than this single collection . the difference is the photo objects collections offer about 20-30 % higher resolution ( i.e . the first image in the collection is 384 pixels wide , but is 492 pixels wide in photo objects ) and you can save the photo objects images with transparent backgrounds ( while this collection forces you to specify a color for the background ) . for the price , this is a good collection . there are lots of shots with minor variations , so it may seem like duplication , but for someone trying to get something just right , that slightly different tilt of the head may be just what the doctor ordered
soft	this was a huge waste of money . if you have plans to make a custom animation , do not buy this . anime only alows you to manipulate one of their few charecters . you can not change eye color or hair color . if you want a good animation you have to go to one of their websites and purchase a character for $ 10- $ 20 . their free ones are completly dumb . using their `` easy to use '' bone rigging tool takes a long time to set up and use . it took me ten minutes to make one for a stick figure . ( which did n't work very well ) you ca n't even group anything unless you buy their $ 180 upgraded version . i spent hours trying to use this , and could figure none of the above out . it also took two weeks to get here instead of four days . i do n't recomend this to people who are looking for an easy to use animation creator .

soft	i have been supporting quickbooks as a financial and technical consultant for small businesses for over a dozen years . this year 's version added a neat feature that allows you to see all of your customer 's invoices , payments , estimates , - all in the same window - just by clicking on a customer in the list . no more multiple clicks to create customer reports . it is just plain easy , and the information pops up on your screen immediately . congratulations to intuit on a job well done

soft	i just installed autoroute 2007 . there is a feature in autoroute where you can display various places of interest on the map . in this version , for some installations you can not hide restaurants . this has been reported on the microsoft uk autoroute community website . i loaded the program on a second computer with the same result . both systems run window xp pro . this means for certain cities , like paris , at certain magnifications , the map is completely cluttered with small green squares which indicate the location of a restaurant . microsoft only indicates that they will enter this bug into the work request for the next version of autoroute . they also say earlier versions were not affected . you may want to buy 2007 but check out your ability to show/hide all of the items of interest right away and be prepared to be dissappointed . i am going to try finding autoroute 2006 for sale
soft	you can get mac os x for 129 bucks and it has everything as opposed to the microsoft 's 227 dollar home premium which is the low end . buy mac and get all the functionality in one os . when spec'ed out the system are comparable in price , except apple does n't offer low-end hardware options which is why they seem more expensive
soft	acrobat 5 was so buggy that i thought i 'd give adobe a couple of product cycles before upgrading . should have waited longer . there have been improvements in v7 : a better look , better commenting , the ability to add text that actually prints , and far better ocr functionality . but other basic functions are way worse than in v5 : some word documents that were easy to convert to pdf in v5 will not convert in v7 , seems to be something to do with font license issues . installation is a nightmare and repeated re-installation was required to get past system hangs , clashes with standard security software , and endless errors in the automatic update feature . the new product activation makes this even more of a pain because too many re-installations force you to activate by phone . despite my already low expectations of adobe , this product is a disappointment . with acrobat 7 , adobe is , as usual , charging top $ for what any decent company would consider an embarrassing mess even as a beta version . ( for reference , my system is window xp pro , pentium 4 3ghz , 2.5gb ram )
soft	i just upgraded my webster software to this version for winxp . it 's ok and does the job it 's intended to perform . but i liked the previous versions that displayed both the definitions and the thesaurus in parallel panels . just a matter of display preference , so it 's not that important to every user .
soft	their approach might work for other languages , but for chinese it 's critically important to understand the grammar of the language , which rosetta stone never explains . it simply displays four pictures at you , with some incomprehensible ( to a beginner ) chinese near them , and you have to learn to match incomprehensible words with the pictures . i 've taken chinese for two years , and i still found it impossible to learn anything from it . i either knew the words already , or i could n't learn whatever it was they were trying to teach . i would be happy with just a videotaped lecture of a mandarin college course , but i ca n't find anything like this for sale or free online
soft	i 've been using quicken for windows for years . since i recently bought a mac , i thought i 'd switch quicken over from mac to windows . forget it ! the mac version is totally incompatible with windows , you must export your data and then re-import it on the mac . this works ok for simple checking / visa accounts , but it **fails completely** for investment or brokerage accounts . if you look on quicken 's support site , they say `` reinvest dividend , reinvest income and banking transactions in an investment account must be *manually entered* '' hello ? ! like i 'm going to manually enter 12 years of investment transactions ? with most major products ( adobe creative suite , ms office ) , the same files work transparently across mac and windows . quicken 's inability to even import the data , nevermind actually opening it , reeks of incompetence . stay away from this product
soft	at home , i 've been a mac user since 1991 . i also have been something of a linux fanatic too and have used several distros , mostly red hat and now fedora core . at work , however i have used ms-dos , windows 3.11 , 95 , 98 and xp . it 's fair to say i have never liked microsoft . but on a laptop i use at work ( an older gateway 400vtx with a 2.2ghz intel celeron ) , i just upgraded to vista home basic . i also upgraded the memory to its maximum 1gb . and despite my years of eschewing microsoft , guess what ? i must say i really like the os . it runs fine on my slower system and i had no problems installing and no conflicts with drivers . i think microsoft has really made a `` cool '' os
soft	version 6 seemed to go off the track by changing many users ' favorite features , like form ordering along with how unattractive bookmarks had become . more than anything , version 7 increases one 's ability to collaborate securely , providing complete control over your document , who can open , print , or even comment on it . but version 7 is more of a fix than a major upgrade , as it cures many of the ills of the previous version . best of all , adobe has kept the price the same . very nice
soft	the program works fine on windows xp and is easy to use . it lets you print cards of many sizes . the big disappointment is in the number of cards that comes with the program . the back of the box claims `` 4500+ cards and sentiments , celebrate life 's special moments with cards for all occasions '' . that 's nice . the problem with that is that i counted the total number of cards that come with the program . it only adds up to 1045 ! so where are the other 3450+ cards and sentiments ? are you supposed to design them yourself ? i just do n't know . and certainly `` cards for all occasions '' means just that , does n't it ? well there 's lots of birthday cards and plenty of holiday cards but not one sympathy card of any kind . i guess you just need to buy those on your own
soft	i had to start version 9 without the user files from version 7 . even without the user files version 9 more quickly adapts to my needs . i can dictate faster and there are fewer mistakes . this reduces the time it requires for me to write a letter or produce a document . for these reasons i 'm quite satisfied with the purchase
soft	excellent for the novice . i callibrated three monitors with the spider . prior to calibration the images were completely different from each other - after i was amazed how close the images were to each other . the process is so simple that even a cave man could do it .
soft	i used a bundled package in a new laptop to create a photo album . when trial time expired , i purchase the full package . i could not open the existing album with the new software . the new full package is hard to use and the so called 1000 's of templates can not be found . use something else ! ! ! i even e-mailed corel about this . its been 4 days , i have not had a response . do not buy ! ! ! i rate this produce as a -2 stars
soft	i initially purchased creator 9 to do the same thing this software does , but the only thing is it didnt hang my computer when it came down to burn the dvd . this software is pretty much easy to use , comes with two ( bibles ) manuals , plenty of information in there to creat some good videos . i recommend buying this or you can always buy creator 9 have it crash your system and then spend a few days trying to review other products out there that have gotten good reviews such as this one . you will be happy with the videos you make . you can make a video containing still images ( pictures ) , video from camcorder camera or from your computer , add text in the movies , add background music , its awesome . i must say again it wont hang your system . please get it , your family and yourself wont be disappointed .
soft	i found the product to work very well for antivirus , spyware and spam . it is nice to have one product at a reasonable price that has multiple functions rather than 3-4 sperate products and their associated cost and maintenance . i had been using norton 2004 , but it only did a good job on viruses . although it would detect spyware after the fact , it did a poor job of removing them . i had also used the ms beta , which although detected more spyware than norton , would not block it . i had one computer that always seemed to be crippled with spyware . since i installed pc-cillin , i 've had no problems . i 've also found the spam blocker to work fairly well , catching about 80 % of the spam . i had been using multiple rules and a spam list with outlook , that probably only blocked about 40 % of the spam , so this is a big improvement . my only complaint is the rebate- i sent in the required info and it was rejected due to `` invalid/missing ups . '' i then sent a copy of the ups they indicated that was missing , but never got anything back .
soft	i bought this cd for my two grandchildren for christmas . they have all the other nancy drew cd 's that are out and really enjoy playing them . they are a good interactive game to challenge their minds . i am sure this one will too
soft	it is a little bit clumsey . when i go to it , instead of my cursor being in the space where i write the word for a definition , i have to place it there and that takes time . the first one of these electronic dictionaries i had ( about 5 years ago ) was fabulous , it was called `` deluxe '' and had everything , but my computer outgrew ot amd the makers have never bothered to bring it up to date and offer it again .
soft	zonealarm by checkpoint is one the best programs for protecting yourself . it is better than norton internet suite
soft	being a pc user for many years ( since 1985 ) i have come through all the versions of ms operating systems ( does anyone out there remember 3.5 ! ) ms has also piggy backed this `` robust '' office product for 20 years . their upgrades are seldom anything more than a better looking toolbar . this is no exception , but this time i like the tool bar ! as to ease of use , i use powerpoint and word often and my spouse uses excel . if there were an easier product available we would buy it but then windows xp would kill it on sight and vista would stop working altogether . why does ms think that everyone but those working in a professional since ( hence office for professionals ) needs all the junk they subject us to ? do those guys in redmond still think adult users of the pc like `` cute '' things like little doggies wagging their tail or a friendly paper clip to help you answer your every question ! i am tired of beta testing ms products for so many years but as a pc user i am stuck with them and until someone else can come up with a better system , other than mac , we are all stuck with them .
soft	maybe i 'm just not pro enough to realize the ways to put some more precise reports together , but that is the only snag in this otherwise capable product . to accomplish the reports that i need , i am able to edit the gantt chart view sufficiently to satisfy my purpose . so , it gets the report done , just not as nicely as i had hoped . tracking work is made incredibly simple . rest assured you can manage a hefty project with this little piece of software
soft	as far as gps software goes , there is nothing better available than streets trips and autoroute . there are dozens of features that you ca n't find with the self-contained gps units . it is easy to add multiple stops and to optimize them into the best order , night-view is another great feature , as are the topographical maps . the new feature offered this year , of easy-linking to satellite photos of places on the map , is also a welcome addition . the only reason i 'm giving it a four is because of the following : 1 ) there is still no ground-level or 3d view of the roads for use in the gps function 2 ) they still have n't added an option to exclude roads that ban trucks or commercial traffic form using them . 3 ) there is n't a lot of coverage for eastern european countries , most notably , nothing in russia . nonetheless , it is still better than any other gps software on the market
soft	i love this adobe product . it works very well for me - only a couple of minor glitches - it keeps asking me to re-register - but that 's only a minor annoyance . overall it is a very good product
soft	i like the product and bought it after having the individual versions on a couple of pcs . it was easy to setup and i love the feature set . the vsmon.exe file uses a lot of memory , though , and the pc seems to slow down some .
soft	if , like myself , you have many dx and vst plug-ins installed on your system , then audition 2.0 is definitely not the choice with you . somehow , the idiots who made this junk have made it completely incompatible with 3rd-party plugs such as waves diamond bundle . oddly enough , this was not a problem in earlier editions of audition , or its former incarnation , cooledit . but now , audition crashes irrevocably when trying to use many vst and dx plugs ( except , of course , the ones made by adobe themselves . ) bottom line ? this software is crap . absolute crap . if you 're serious about audio production , go with wavelab . heck , even free multitrack audio software like kristal works better than this . if , for some reason , you absolutely need audition , then go with an earlier , more stable version , such as 1.5 . 2.0 is about as useful as a football bat .
soft	i have a 2 month old high-end dell pc with tons of memory and disk , running windows xp pro . this game does n't work . period . first of all , when i installed it , it reset my graphics options . second , when i attempt to play a game , even at the settings that it chose , i get nothing but a white screen . after numerous tries , and killing the program with the task manager , i finally attempted the other activities options . clicking on them does absolutely nothing ! it does n't recognize my mouse clicks . i 'm assuming that the game was written for the apple mac , and ported to the pc . trust me , it does n't work . btw , we have tons of other kids games and have never had a problem with any of them . now i have to figure out how to return this silly thing .
soft	this software messed up my computer big time . it does something first of all , to microsoft word . word does not work properly after installation of photo explosion . it then went into different areas of my computer and screwed it up . at first i only suspected it to be photo explosion . i had to have my computer sent back to hp . when i got it back i reinstalled photo explosion and the same thing happenend . be careful . product has big problems - which will give you bigger problems - i guarantee it .
soft	i am in agreement with others here who indicate that 4.0 is a downgrade from 3.0 . performance is very poor , especially the organizer . it 's depressing to see how fast alternative programs are , such as mac iphoto and even the canon software that came with my camera , compared to elements . recently , i 've been getting lots of crashes , though everything else on my system is completely stable . the only reason i gave it more than 1 star is it does have some nice functionality , when it works correctly
soft	1 . you ca n't print on anything over 8.5x14 paper . useless if you want to review your house to any standard scale . 2 . i bought this thinking that it would be better than my 1993 version 3.0 of broderbund 3d home architect . it turns out that this is exactly the same software ! i strongly recommend looking for something better
soft	i have used both paperport 8 and paperport 9 deluxe for over a year so i am qualified to report . both pieces of software have some form of severe incompatibility with windows xp pro . i can not really get version 9 to operate . everytime i try its like cold molasses . click ... wait ... .wait ... .wait ... wait ... and then lock up . i 'm very experienced . i 've been working with pcs since 1991 . every other piece of software i 've loaded works very well ... except for paperport 8 and 9 . in theory paperport 9 should be fine because it converts all scans to pdf which is more or less a universal file format . however theory is a lot better than reality . support is nonexistent from scansoft . if you pay the $ 19.95 per incident , you still do not get a solution . the scansoft forum is always either not working ( another bad sign ) or it 's full of people complaining about the software and lack of support . unfortunately there are not a lot of alternatives , but doqments looks promising . avoid paperport unless you have money and time to waste
soft	i recently purchased this software to redesign my bathroom and bedroom . compared to other products that i have evaluated , punch ! interior design suite wins hands-down in the areas of versatility , stability , and 3d . it includes many precision , dimension , and viewing options that allow you to make both simple and complex designs . using the split 2d/3d mode also helps with placing components such as windows and doors . after i completed the drawings i showed them to my builder and he was able to remodel the rooms exactly as i had envisioned them . like most software i have used , this package does contains a learning curve . i by no means consider myself a computer guru and i had to put in a little practice time . you will find , however , a plethora of resources available both on-line and within the manual/tutorials to assist you with your project
soft	i fell in love with another genealogy software years ago and was not happy with any newer ones when support and updates stopped for my original version . when ancestry updated this year i decided i had to try a new software package again that was compatible with the cool things you can now do on ancestry so purchased this version . i was very pleasantly surprised and happy . i am still learning the best way to do things and occsionally get frustrated correcting info i have entered incorrectly but i would certainly recommend it . the online checking it does and ability to attach the records found online is pretty awesome
soft	the updates are frequent and expensive . good program , but it 's not worth the trouble and expense of upgrading
soft	i 've been a long time user of trend micro 's pccillin but after reading poor reviews on their latest version i decided i did n't want to take a chance on it so i went looking for different anti-virus software . i stumbled onto this zonealarm ( piece of junk ) and after reading mostly wonderful reviews i down loaded their trial . it did n't seem too bad . after a few weeks i bought this 3 computer suite and installed it . i went a while longer and notice my computer 's performance was not as good as it was . i downloaded upgrades and uninstalled old versions and installed new . now after about a month my computer is practically unusable ( as well as the kid 's - they have been screaming about slow computer since the start ) . this zonealarm is the worst software i have ever used . it hogs cpu and memory . it gets the cpu usage to 80 - 100 % and it does n't free it up . i shut down all programs and cpu just keeps churning away . the interesting thing is that at times i would check task manager processes and system idle would be 90 % but when you check the performance tab the cpu chart would be near 100 % ? go figure ! i finally said enough and uninstalled it ( and deleted every occurrence of zonealarm out of the registry ) and downloaded trend micro 's pccillin . it 's installed and i got my old machine back . log-ins take 40 seconds were they would take over 3 minutes with za . cpu is back to normal . you could n't give me this cr*ppy software . i wish i would have stuck with pccillin and saved the $ 40
soft	i have had nothing short of an excellent experience with this product . i have created numerous videos of my children 's escapades and sporting events . i do have one warning however . provide the grandparents with a box of tissues because they never fail to cry when they see their little angels parading across the widescreen . the software is extremely intuitive and easy to use . my wildest expectations were exceeded .
soft	i like the way the program goes through the tax forms as if you are interviewing with a tax preparer . however , i think it needs to do a better job of explaining why a tax form can not be emailed and how to address that issue
soft	this upgrade is a disaster . first of all , in word , the view markups function is the default now , so you have to go through and change all the settings to hide markups ( most people in my department do not want to see those distracting colors and balloons and do not need to edit the doc in any way ) . however , if you want to send a document that does not have the tracked changes embedded -- because you do n't know which version of word the recipient has , and you ca n't take the chance of them seeing all those comments -- you have to go through the document again , view markups , reject the comments , accept changes , and resave . it 's kind of difficult to explain , and frustrating too . people think that if they ca n't see it , then the recipient wo n't be able to see it either . this is a good explanation from a microsoft help forum : *not displaying* tracked changes is n't the same as *not having* tracked changes . even when using word 2002 , the changes were still in the documents , and anyone could see them just by turning on the display . all that has happened in 2003 is that the display is automatic . the way to have documents in which changes are not displayable is to remove the changes from the documents entirely -- and to do that you must *accept or reject* all the changes . nothing you do with the view will be sufficient . if you need to retain a record of the changes , you 'll have to maintain two sets of documents : one with the changes , which *never* leave your office , and another that has been `` scrubbed '' and can be sent out . still , it 's a big problem and more unnecessary work than 2002 's version . also , outlook 's new default view is quite different than before . the panes are set differently , so you have to go to view/reading panes to change the positions . and then you have to ungroup items ( the breaks in between the weeks are very annoying ... most people do n't like that , although i guess some people think it looks more organized ) . oh , microsoft - ca n't live with it , ca n't live without it . almost forgot ... the buttons/icons are prettier in this version , and we all know that that makes a huge difference . yessss ! pretty buttons ! i can die happy now .
soft	ok , sorry , i 've been vectoring line art since 1990 . my current machine is an amd athlon xp with the 333 fsb , 1 gig ram 80 gig hd shared on network a 40 gig hd for software , os is xppro , it 's 2 years old i think . i installed three cathode ray tubes , you know ; big boxy monitors , the largest of which is a 21 inch monster right in my face all day . i read the reviews here and started `` quaking '' in my boots ! oops i said to myself , and i looked up my previous day 's purchases for the new artist i just hired . sure enough ; i bought cs2 for the new machine . so i downloaded the 30 day trial for illustrator cs2 upyours , i mean upgrade . replacing my old illustrator 8.01 these kids i 've been interviewing made me think i should take a look outside my cave ! so i got it loaded up and sure enough ; it takes longer to load than my old corrupted rusty buddy ; illustrator 8.01 , about twice as long . ( so leave it running ) ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! but wow ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i should have done this sooner , or should i have ? as soon as it was running illustrator cs2 auto updated itself . it wanted it 's adobe bridge fixed up . so i let it . this is just exactly what people have been complaining about . ******** the bridge is fixed ********* way super cool dude ! i keep the bridge open on the right monitor and i can drag art into illustrator cs2 at lightning speed . the whole time i get to see super big previews of all the artwork i need to work with . way better than xppro 's little thumbnails . live trace : realy nice , i think this is what these companies are using to sell vectored line art to printers like me . it is very accurate and seems to acomodate all those nasty giant pixels that up till now , took a human brain to see past while vectoring . ok , it 's not as good as a skilled craftsman such as ( full of ) myself , but for only about $ 160 or so , it 's like a gift from almighty god ! no crashes , no bugs , just pure inteligence from adobe once again . do n't you think of a little white mud hut in the dessert when you say adobe ? i really apreciate the object oriented work bar thing at the top , wait , let me go look at what it 's called , hmmmm , still do n't know , well it changes according to what kind of object you 've clicked on in your artwork . also this new wonder of technology solves an old problem of global color change needed for color separation work . that top task bar object oriented do-hickey is similar but better than the one in photoshop . transparent objects , looks like everything can be transparent , wow , do you know what that means ? ? ? i got ta go use it some more , it 's just way to cool . ok , i 'm back , even fonts can be transparent , .tiffs .jpgs , everything . this means way less jumping back and forth from photoshop to illustrator . but i do believe you have to be very capable with your hardware , operating system , and have at least a year ; full time with illustrator and photoshop to fully appreciate the thought and creative potential that adobe has opened up for us
soft	do n't buy zone alarm if you use aol ; they are not compatable . the pop-ups will drive you crazy and aol wo n't work properly . also plan on your computer running much slower when this software is installed . i bought it from amazon and had to throw it away in a month ... no refund ; money lost . norton is far better with aol
soft	it seems that all previous quickbook versions will not run on windows vista and i had upgraded my system . so , i bought simple start as the least expensive way to get a quickbook product to run on vista . turns out simple start runs fine on vista but you can not load a company file from earlier versions . thus , simple start was simply useless to me . when i called intuit customer service they said that for another $ 100 they 'd give me a license number that would unlock that feature . by that time i was committed and had no choice . talk about getting ripped off ! !
soft	looks nice ... but beware ! installed norton 360 on the 6 workstations in our small office . as soon as i did that our accounting system ( peachtree ) started to lock up a few times a day . even after turing off the firewall on all workstations the accounting system still locked up . i 've now uninstalled norton 360 on the server pc and that seems to have solved the problem . i wish now that i had just upgraded from norton internet security 2005 to 2007 ... never again .

soft	i bought this software at the recommendation of my accountant . well , after trying to use it for two years now , i 'm ready to burn it . it 's a great software for people who do their business by the projects , but it 's not good for retail sales . everything has been a hassel , especially trying to set up the daily sales so i can record detailed inventory of my daily sales . yes , i noticed they did come out w/a new version for specifically for retail sales . after i already invested in $ 300 in software and $ 100 in books just trying to learn this system . what a waste !
soft	i read the review saying simple start did n't have enough features and would lead to upgrading to get a usable version . despite the warning , i thought i could get away with simple start because i was buying the program for bookkeeping at a tiny church and would be putting few demands on the program . even for my simple needs , it was a bust i had to upgrade to pro for an additional $ 100 . if quicken is n't enough for your needs , get pro .
soft	bought system mechanic 6 pro online , it repairs but reports problems but you can not get information at all . none of the modules report what is being done . if you need assistance forget it , all you get from iolo is go see the faq 's , i do n't think humans work there just a computer that generates emails . stay away from this company ! !
soft	this program does exactly as i expect . i am very pleased
soft	i 've been frustrated for quite some time now with having adobe reader and expecting it should do what adobe acrobat can do . i was especially interested in creating pdf 's ( portable document formats ) of word documents . although i have photoshop that can do this for me in a roundabout way , i was n't satisfied with the extra time it took to do so . faced with the assignment of pulling together a rather large family cookbook , aptly named , `` death by cholesterol '' , i felt justified in finally purchasing not only `` acrobat '' but also `` omnipage '' , an ocr ( optical character recognition ) software . with these programs in hand it made the project fun to do . now i have the whole cookbook with its index as a sinle multi-page pdf file that can be read and also printed out by anyone i care to send it to over the internet . it 's of great value to me now and gives me enhanced versatility even though i 've only used a small part of its capabilities . the reason that i 've only given it a `` 4 '' rating ? i 'm upset that i did n't get the full version , but i ca n't justify doing so . i 'm being petulant
soft	i got tiger to improve the working of my powerbook g4 1.5 . my jaguar installation was getting pokey after two years and a clean install with tiger cleared out the annoying slowdowns in my computer . before tiger , my computer would hang when playing large dv files ( such as the ones i made in imovie ) but now they run without a hitch even though the hardware is the same . this tiger upgrade does n't include some of the apps ( games , quicken , etc . ) that my wife has on her new macbook , but it did include a 30-day trial verion of iworks which has come in handy
soft	mutual fund basis calculations are broken , updates fail on the mac . not to mention no state in this edition . it 's absurd how many different versions of turbotax there are this year . it almost takes longer to try to figure out which one to buy than it does to do your taxes . i 'm done with turbotax , switching to taxcu

soft	having had norton products installed for years including antivirus , internet security , and systemworks , i decided to replace the installed products with norton 360 and a non-norton password manager . obviously , it is critical to first remove all norton programs before installing norton 360 . the installation process proceeded relatively smoothly . my computing environment includes a 1.6ghz processor , 1,000mb of memory , and 6gb of available disk . the background scans and liveupdate have played havoc with my other applications by periodically locking up the entire cpu at 100 % cpu utilization . one application that streams radio broadcasts now stops . i immediately disabled the automatic updates and scheduled backups , however , the cpu occasionally still locks . additionally , there is no way to transfer security settings from previous norton products to norton 360 thereby making the installation process very labor intensive . if you now have separate norton security products and are satisfied with them , save your money and renew the norton subscriptions .
soft	i use my microsoft streets and trips software to plan my route , intermediate stops , and destination for any travel via automobile or truck . i am especially pleased with the ability to see and print a detailed guide for locating street addresses for those destinations with which i may be unfamiliar . this is especially helpful for delivery of items to a customer whose business may be on a relatively remote street in areas that are difficult to find . i have tried a few other software systems that claim to do what streets and trips does , and i found none of those sustems could equal or even compete with microsoft streets and trips 2007
soft	this is the first time i have ever reviewed a product and i do it so that no one else will waste their money on this . it adds virtually nothing to xp . too bad they did n't make it as interesting as their packaged media edition . that would have been worth the money , but old bill who does n't want to be the richest man in the world would rather you spend money on a new pc to get that product . the themes are nice but far too few for the price . the games are a gimmick since you have to pay to play the real things . the dj is dumb and the dancers are cute but after a while boring . hard to figure out how to use the music converter and photo stuff . too bad could have been something but in its present form , not worth the money
soft	i purchased fix-it primarily to correct a registry problem . it was rated very highly on the pcworld website . it did a great job . i had over 850 registry errors , corrected them and did a reorg on the registry . my computer is running beter now . the other utilities included work as advertised . i have been using norton systemworks for many years and this product is very comparable at a lower price
soft	i am average when it comes to design , but the tutorial helped me in creating a logo and it 's cheaper and better for me to create one myself than pay someone to do it . i like the tracing feature which allows you to remove parts of a photo to place in a new background . to get the most out of this software you really need to be familiar with a lot of the features already , and there 's a lot i am missing . i will just have to take more time to keep practicing and learning from trial and error

soft	i purchased this program recently , and was very disappointed . the maps are very limited ... for example , most of the major tourist areas ( beaches , newport , ect . ) in rhode island are cut out of the ri map . i recommend buying ms streets and trips 2005 ( which includes pocket streets 2005 in the box ) instead : http : //www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/b0002doeam/qid=1121691049/sr=8-2/ref=pd_bbs_2/103-6971135-7476654 ? v=glance=pc=507846 with this program , you have the entire usa at your disposal , and you can select which maps to send to your pocket pc or smartphone . fortunatly , the store that sold me pocket streets allowed me to exchange it for streets and trips ( after paying the difference ) . the prices are very close .

soft	i recently purchased microsoft office , and so far , i have had the chance to use microsoft word . i am familiar with the product as i have had the older version before , with my old computer . i was pleased to find that i had no trouble with using my old files with this new software . i also was glad to find a variety of templates which were easy to use . i was able to print out business cards for me and my husband in just one morning . i am also glad that it is n't very much different from the old version , so i was able to use the program easily , without much adjustment .
soft	i received the bundle but there is no installation key for shade le . i noticed the someone else 's review stating this same problem is no longer visible so i figured i 'd post it again
soft	you can try this for free for up to 60 days by registering with microsoft and downloading an evaluation copy . when you 're sure you want it , permanently activate it with the product key you get in your amazon package . the new version of excel has two huge advantages : 1 . it removes the old 256 column/65,536 row limitation . you can now have 16,384 columns and more than a million rows . 2 . excel 2007 can use all the cores/processors in your computer ( or you can restrict it to use only some , so huge background calculations do not tie up your machine ) . on my dual core computer , excel 2007 is **way** faster than 2003 at almost every task . i 've seen no crashes , hangs , or hiccups . but everything else about excel 2007 is frustrating . the new `` ribbon '' interface is unnecessary and awkward -- almost every operation takes more pointing and clicking than older releases . bypassing the ribbon with the new `` quick access toolbar '' is problematic because ( bizarrely ) microsoft has deleted many distinctive command icons , leaving them with identical green circles . right now excel 2003 costs more than excel 2007 . if the two plusses do n't help you , you may think that 2003 is worth more
soft	i am not a `` computer person '' but found this to be easy , easy , easy
soft	( this review is of the spyware edition ) nis takes 25megs of ram - ok for an all-in-one ( if you have & lt ; 256megs your lightweight cpu ca n't carry enough armor to make windows really zero-day net safe imho ) nis has most of the features i look for in a firewall/spyware/virus scanner/intrusion detector , but half do n't work right , and some that do seem to fight every attempt to make them work . even after liveupdate this week , one buggy automatic firewall rule autoloaded , and port 80 was open listening half 'naked ' on the internet . i replaced it , and at the first passing probe my rule was erased , autoreplaced , naked again . only after i stumbled onto the secret trick ( add a block all rule after the pass rules ) did it close it . it took 11 clicks ( ! ) just to add the block all rule - miserable ! the log is a nightmare - pages of long sentences explaining `` permitted once '' 200 times , no actual info until i click on one of them . what 's worse is , none of them i checked were `` permitted once '' iirc . nis detected 2 trojan/spywares , but could not remove either . enabling program component monitoring started an avalanche of popups , all suggesting i block access , but i actually do want ie to access the internet . running windows update brought a popup asking if 100 's more dll 's are ok. how would i know ? i do want windows updated . great feature in theory , totally useless even if you know the names of every evil dll not yet invented . if you have more than 1 or 2 programs not in the automatic ruleset , plan to either `` permit all '' or spend many hours actually writing the same set of 3 rules over and over for every autoupdating program you use - assuming you understand tcp vs udp etc . why no `` permit all local + dns + outbound port 80 '' choice ? that would mean 1/10 the work ! jetico lets me pick `` web browser '' ruleset , so its ui from hell gets used once per category . after spending all day and half the night getting it working , i discover that it is not possible to save my precious rules - or to reload them . i would be less furious if i had a fresh install of windows , but not much . all good , until a program autoupdates , and 3 more rules to write . too angry for words . jetico lets me clone the old rules or edit them to update the program sig . i would not use nis if you paid me 10 times its price .
soft	before using colorvision spyder2 my monitor was calibrated with the free adobe gamma program installed as part of adobe photoshop . my monitor looked great and the photos i printed looked great too . the colors were spot on . after using spyder2 express my monitor looks worse . my monitor appears dim , the color temperature is too warm and colors look green and dull . if i had known it was going to ruin my already great looking monitor i would n't have wasted my time . my hope was that it would make my monitor look better , not worse . i am not at all satisfied with this product would n't recommend buying it . instead try adobe gamma or look for other free monitor calibration software tools online
soft	i bought the datapilot universal pro kit recently and it worked great ! my screen broke on my nokia 6102 , and i ended up buying a razor . i had some really important numbers on that phone and this program really saved me . transferred all my numbers from my broken one into my new razor in a couple of minutes . also , the image editor and the ringtone thingy came in very useful for saving images and sending mp3s to my phone .
soft	two weeks ago i attempted to do my taxes on this software . however , it could n't complete the hybrid car tax credit portion so i could file . i had two weeks until the update was available . i downloaded it just now and entered the new questions regarding the hybrid and was told i had a credit of $ 3,100 . however , it never added this number to my total tax credits . all customer support could come up with was `` start over from scratch , do n't even import your information from last year 's taxcut '' . never again
soft	at first i thought the idea of offering a set of the most popular applications at an affordable price was great . recently , however , many computer makers have started using ms works as the standard pre-loaded suite on new machines . users who need more than very very basic features will need to buy more dependable software packages ( e.g . ms office ) . the word processor in works , for instance , does not have many macrons that are commonly used in dutch , scandinavian , turkish , romanized russian , japanese etc.. in the end the low price of ms works is a way to save money to computer makers and to squeeze out extra money from buyers who will need to upgrade to better products anyway
soft	this game is great ! after buying mia reading i thought it was a great idea to get my 2 girls to start learning spanish since we live in a global village . they game was easy to load , easy to navigate and the level was perfect for beginners . the high quality 3d animation will blow you away . even my husband who learned 3d animation at the vancouver film school was blown away . the best part is , that they love playing it as they think it is a game . they forget they 're learning numbers and vocab and how to put together simple sentences . well recommended
soft	i think this software is excellent for biginning designers like me . it gives a great range of choices to help you expand your imagination create new personal things each time you work . the only problem faced me was that it does n't support other languages , but it works with wordart
soft	well its definetly improved version since the last one , but they still have a lot of things to do . the biggest problem is pages . if text has specific symbols , like greek letters and u try to export your file to doc , forget it . u 'll have the same problem as 10 yrs ago , either funky symbols or underline dashes . keynote is much better . but if u r a scientist and not a sales man , both packages still have a lot of room for improvement . however , i 'm still happy with this purchase , because it 's apple soft and looks much nicer than any ms software will get in the future
soft	i used this software to do a scrapbook for my mother for her birthday . first of all the software takes up a huge amount of space ! like 1600mb . the program is so slow and i have a relatively new computer . after about 4 pages in one file it becomes impossible to work with and then crashes . i had two files - 6 pages - crash and the work was gone . all the work gone . the text editor will add typos and put in and take out spaces . sometimes it works great other times you have to restart your computer . once it added bright green lines where i had added all of the embellishments to the page - everything other than the background . i had to redo it . piece of junk ! but what does print on a color laser - do n't try it with inkjet - looks great
soft	the hard-copy of britannica has been the standard in reference for centuries , now you can have all of that , with video , audio , tons of photos , and extra support from the web for a fraction of the price of the original . for what you get , it 's an incredible deal and an indispensable part of any reference library
soft	i changed from quicken to quickbooks and regret it . yes , quick books does some wonderful reports and invoiceing but i have found it difficut to use and especially to download crdit card transactions from my business credit cards . i have also found it difficut to match transactions . to get a better handle on my expenses i am going back to quicken or try another program . online help and tutorials , `` dummies guide ... . not helpful either . you would think see they make quicken they would allow import of qif files . dissapointed .
soft	i usually use adaware to scan my computer weekly , and like others , i would like to try the trial version spyware doctor to scan my computer . the result was , i had more than 200 infections ! i was amazed that my other virus scan programs did n't catch any of these infections , and my computer had been running properly . of coz , i would like to remove these infections and so i paid with my creditcard and got the license no . after entering the license no . and scanning , i continued to remove the infections that spyware doctor had caught . before clickinig the remove button , i checked what i would delete and the files seems ok to be deleted . i had to restart my computer in order to complete removing the infections . i clicked yes to restart . from then , my nightmare began , i could n't start my computer at all ! ! ! not even displaying the loggin window ! my computer just kept restarting again and again . after 5 times restarting automatically , i smelled something burning from my computer ! ! ! i was so scared becoz there are some important files that i have n't backup yet ! endup , i reformat my computer ! ! ! i could n't login my old account again ! now , i have a new administrator account and lost all the softwares that i orginally have . luckily i was able to reinstall 70 % of the softwares ( you got ta know the serial no . for most of the softwares are not working after reinstall , and that took me long time to find ways reinstalling them , and not all of them ! ) some of my important files could n't be opened again because i do n't have the softwares to open them ! i was/am still so mad about this ! the spyware doctor removed my system operating files and that 's why i could n't restart my computer . yet , i reinstalled spyware doctor again because i paid and only used it once . however , i could n't use it after reinstalling like other softwares . even i followed the instruction online to reenter the licence no . that i purchased , it 's just simply not working ( the website said i do n't have to repurchase and it should work ! ) so i paid $ 10 , only used the spyware doctor once , but i lost all other softwares that cost totally more than $ 400
soft	i do n't understand why testing for each language exercise is not the default selection instead of having to select it . it is frustrating to go through an entire exercise hoping to see how well you did ... .and realize that you forgot to select `` test '' at the beginning . also , it seems that testing should be available for the 'guided exercise ' also ... ... not just the regular exercises . other than these two things , the program is very good
soft	after being greeted with much excitement , this program would n't properly install on my not-so-fussy computer . the web assistance was of little help at all and we had to send it back . very disappointing
soft	my five and six year old love this game ! it sparks their interest in things around them and now we play our own `` i spy '' riddles in the car , at dinner or out on walks . i highly recommend it
soft	tough to upgrade if you have an earlier version on your machine . also , poor layout of controls make clicking on wrong button really easy . they still have not gotten it right
soft	do not buy anything from this company unless you will be able to return it within 20-30 days of the shipping date . ( the receipt says 20 days but the web site says 30 days . ) you do n't have much time to return an item , and the company does not give any leeway for christmas orders . i am stuck with the item my son did not want for his dorm room , and i ca n't exchange it for another item because he did n't like any of their products .
soft	understand . i have a full ms new office suite that i got from work . but choose to use this product for the many items included which ca n't be beat . if you just want to use word and nothing else then get it alone . this is fine . but the other products are worth the discount and rebate also . cost is the lowest i found . if you have a reward ceriticate using amazon credit card . that $ 25 more off the price . so in the end it cost me $ 30 for it . shop smart and use any break you could get . right ?
soft	... and i knew it would n't be the last . very very fun . do n't think nancy drew is just for girls , guys can play and love the game as well . i am living proof of that . the game itself really is n't that hard , it is just some of the puzzles can be very tricky ( i do n't like puzzles ) and that is the only 'beef ' i have with the game , and most mystery games . now , back to the game itself.. intriguing storyline , suspicous characters and they all got something to hide . search for clues while interrogating suspects.. explore the resort , run errands , break into locked rooms without getting caught , disable alarms , and snoop.. and that is just the tip of the iceburg . if you like mystery games , nancy drew is for you ! her games are n't overly hard , and they are very fun . even if you are n't a mystery fan , try it ! you 'll love it . try them all ! you will become a nancy drew fan , trust me.. i did
soft	the game is called fritz and chesster . fritz is the boy . chester is a rat . that girl you see in the picture , her name is bianca . she never actually plays . she just says things like `` well done , brave knight ! '' and asks stupid questions . at one point poor bianca points out that the queen is the strongest piece , and fritz makes a comment about his mother chewing out his father . the tone and context are extremely anti-woman , in my opinion . he also counters by saying that boys are smarter . it seems like the makers of this game were really threatened by the fact that you have to call the most powerful piece `` she '' . to take the queen down a notch , they refer to a group or queens as a harem . to demonstrate how this powerful piece moves they have the queen run around picking flowers as fast as she can . a male voice says , `` off you go , '' in a tone which one can only assume is meant to accompany a little pat on her behind .
soft	the item was received promptly and worked perfectly . thanks for a great purchase . bo
soft	the operating system is a very good operating system for a home computer . but , obviously , if you want a computer with more security features or networking features , you should go with windows xp professional . at the time that i am writing this , which is a long time from when i purchased windows xp , it is a time where windows vista is emerging . if you plan on upgrading a slightly older computer , i recommend windows xp home/professional ( based on your requirements ) . but if you are looking for a safe operating system for your beast , try windows vista . but one word of warning about vista , the user account control ( uac ) is a pain in the butt
soft	once again quickbooks dangles promises to us mac folk that just do n't add up . if you 're like me , your accountant and bookkeeper are on windoz - that 's why i was psyched when i thought i would really be able to share my mac qb files with them , and vice-versa . mistake # 1 - i give my bookkeeper a backup from qb 2006 before i updated to 2007 . big mistake . qb is not backward compatable . so when my bookkeper sent the file back to me in mac format , ( after spending hours updating it ) , i was not able to import it into qb 2007 . to me , this is nuts . but the helpful tech person we spoke with , suggested that even if it had been '07 this sharing business between mac and windows versions is sort of a one time deal . this was n't intended to be a back and forth thing , between mac and windows . huh ? so what 's the point ? here 's my work-around : i bought a used xp box on ebay and am trading my mac '07 for windoz '07 .
soft	i installed this software after getting it free after rebates , and i must say i am not the least bit impressed . it claims to speed up your system , but instead only slows it down . seems like it would be because it was bugging down my computer , but it 's relatively new and has a gig of memory . as another reviewer mentioned , my internet stopped working correctly ( although the other computers on my network without this program worked just fine with internet ! ) and my system restore just would n't work . it deleted a lot of entries i needed to run my system correctly . the anti-spyware was an absolute joke the updates were large files almost every day . 8 mb a day practically . on a lighter note , fix-it utilities found a virus other programs were unable to find . i use zone alarm security suite and then use ccleaner to take care of the rest . i think they 're the best combination . no program beats zone alarm 's . fast , secure , and wo n't bug down your computer . i had to reinstall my operating system thanks to fix-it utilities
soft	i wanted a simple product with a good red eye removal tool . this program does not do well with fixing red eye . software did not come with a manual . i am computer literate yet i found this software not easy to navigate . i found hp essentials which is a free download from the hp website to be a better program .
soft	way to many problems with this version , if you want to replace all your printers , scanners , sound cards and so on , go for it.otherwise stay away
soft	this is a good software for casual use ( hiking , biking , geocaching ) , but not without issues . on the positive side , it definitely beats all non-digital ( scanned usgs maps ) alternatives . the level of details is good enough ( how many of us need to know topography down to 5 feet ? ) . the fact that maps are digitally generated ( with vectors i believe ) makes all the labels clear at any scale . it has two advantages over its main `` digital '' competitor , ng topo . first , all of the us is on one dvd for the price of separate state/region cds from ng . and second , it is available . i could not even find ng 's northeast edition anywhere on the web ! one might think nh and me are some obscure corners of the globe and not big tourist destinations . now the few negatives . the exchange feature with gps is flaky . sometimes it takes several tries of unplugging and replugging the cable and restarting the program before it recognizes my garmin . part of it could be that low and mid range gps still have serial connection and are not truly plug-and-play even with com-to-usb adapter ( beats me why garmin ca n't make all their gps with usb in this day and age ) . in any case , regardless of whose fault it is , it is annoying at times not to be able to connect the two smoothly . the second problem i noticed was with the 3-d window . it clearly consumes a lot of memory and crashes my laptop if i do a lot of rapid rescaling . i ended up just closing that window , since it is pretty much for `` coolness '' and does not add any real topographical value . finally , i had a problem with delorme 's service . i purchased it from amazon with a rebate offer . however , a month after submitting the necessary info i received a card from delorme stating that the bar code i sent was not a upc code . the box only had one bar code on it so i am not sure how i could have made a mistake . they requested that i send a correct one , but with the code cut out and gone , how do they expect me to come up with one ? ! i feel a little bit like that was a cheap way out of paying the rebate but $ 20 is not worth the time arguing with them over it . i would be interested to hear if anyone else experienced the same problem .
soft	i needed a document management system . after looking for software , there only appeared to be paperport . i had read somewhere that the software becomes incredibly slow with a large number of files . i guessed a large number meant 2500+ at least . this concerned me , so i called pre-sales at scansoft , and asked if it was slow with a large number of files . he was not sure ! so he told me to call technical . i called technical , and it his responses were very slow and sounded like he was reading them out to me . i asked if he was reading the scansoft website and he said yes , so i hung up . obviously i read their site for an answer , and did not need to be paying international call charge for someone who seemed less knowledgeable than myself to read it . i got the software . basically all the software consists of is windows explorer and scanning software . it worked well , and i thought ok , expensive for what it is , when windows explorer and scanning software ( usually free ) would nearly do most of it , but then after around 560 pdfs , it started running very slow . i thought it was my machine so installed it and the pdfs on a new vaio 1.7mhz , 1 gig laptop . same problem . if you click to view the pdf then hit the return back , it takes 12 seconds ! so if you view a document , it takes a good few seconds but then when you hit back to the paperport desktop to continue it takes 12 seconds ! ! ! completely unusuable ! if you have less than 500 files , it is maybe expensive software , but for more than 500 do not waste you money . it runs so slow you can not use it . i wonder how scansoft get away with it - surely they should have tested it internally with thousands of files
soft	learn to play chess with fritz and chesster 2 , continues where the first cd left off . like the first cd , this program may take some guessing regarding what exactly is one supposed to do , and clicking on the crown in the upper right corner helps to navigate through the game . this program is really good for grasping the basic tactics and strategies because your progress is measured and you have to develop certain skill proficiency before moving to higher level and learning more tactics and strategies . the cd covers some popular opening moves , middle game tactics like pins , forks , skewers and deflection , and mating strategies in end game . with practice on this cd , you can begin to win some games , and then move on to learn to play chess with fritz and chesster 3 , which is out in german , and is supposed to be out soon in english
soft	love the program ... . hate the company ! i 've been using quickbooks for more than 10 years . i started with the basic edition since i am a very small business and use only a portion of the program , specifically customer and vendor lists , invoicing , a/r and purchase orders . overkill is an understatement ... quickbooks pro is much more powerful than i need . i do n't use payroll , check printing , year end accounting and many of its other functions . so why did i purchase such a powerful program ? that 's the `` rub '' . intuit is not satisfied with its quickbooks users being content with the edition that they are using ; intuit sales people call all too frequently trying to get you to upgrade to the next higher version ( edition ) of their program . they hounded me for years to upgrade from the early basic edition to the then current basic edition ; finally , they dropped support of the product and i had no choice . i purchased quickbooks 2005 basic edition in 2005 . shortly after purchasing it , they informed me that they were no longer going to support the 2005 basic edition and if i wanted continued support i would have to upgrade again , this time to the pro edition . this january ( 2007 ) i received an email from intuit informing me that my 2005 basic edition would n't run on the new windows xp vista platform and if i switched to vista i would need to upgrade to quickbooks pro . i upgraded to a new pc in february as the result of a major crash on my former system and opted to go with vista , thinking that i could install windows 98 as a second operating system to run quickbooks 2005 basic . the second operating system did n't work out and , after seriously considering switching to microsoft accounting 2007 , i purchased quickbooks pro . i was very disappointed that intuit did n't offer a significant purchase incentive to existing users ; but they never have in all the years that i 've been using their product . even microsoft , the shark of sharks , offers incentives . do n't be misheartened . i purchased the program from amazon and , with rebates and other purchase incentives , saved $ 60 over intuit 's price ; i could have saved an additional $ 25 if i had bought on ebay ( had i known it at the time ) .
soft	h block does a much better job marketing software than writing it . i used the on-line version , had trouble registering so chose the option to begin entering data and register later . after about an hour of painfully slow entry , sometimes just one item per page , most of the time looking at `` loading , please wait '' i had to keep an appointment so tried to register and save . no luck , repeated attempts to register gave unidentified error , and i could not save without registering . finally just left the computer on and left ; when i came back taxcut had timed out and lost all my data . by the way there is a screen which looks like you are accepting the terms of a software agreement but if you read the fine print you are agreeing to let them sell your e-mail to other companies . even if you select no you will get frequent e-mails from h block . i will save time and do my taxes on paper forms this year . when a company ca n't get something simple like this right , it calls into question everything they do
soft	i received this item today and was surprised 1 ) it was shipped from overseas ( uk ) 2 ) it came with only one cd instead of two like a previous reviewer thought 3 ) no paperwork - it came in a clear case with no artwork , info , etc 4 ) sonic foundry sold acid to sony in 2003 ( according to sonic foundry 's website ) and sf no longer provides support 5 ) i ca n't get this to register online , which seems a little dodgy , but other than that , it seems functional . no huge library of loops , either . ca n't really say i got what i expected
soft	i received this product and have been using it for a couple of weeks . it is exactly as advertised . it is very easy to use and the software is extremely user friendly . i am amazed at the quality of the recordings . i would definately recommend this product
soft	i always thought the laborious interviews in turbotax were pretty ridiculous , now i 've seen the opposite . taxcut online seems totally not thorough , such as just asking for total of certain things , and not asking if special circumstances apply , which you do n't miss at all until you have one of them . i had almost completely finished my taxes and got to the business use of home . i moved half way through the year . i could n't find where to add an additional home office listing . `` nope , ca n't do it '' said support after an hour long chat session of mostly waiting , `` you 'll have to use another product . '' so today i start from scratch and pay the $ 99 ransom that turbotax is charging small business owners . i encourage the competition to get their shizzle together next year . s :
soft	maybe i 'm just not pro enough to realize the ways to put some more precise reports together , but that is the only snag in this otherwise capable product . to accomplish the reports that i need , i am able to edit the gantt chart view sufficiently to satisfy my purpose . so , it gets the report done , just not as nicely as i had hoped . tracking work is made incredibly simple . rest assured you can manage a hefty project with this little piece of software

soft	we have kid pix 3 and my kids ( 4 6 ) played it all the time . we just `` upgraded '' to kid pix 4 , and my initial experience has prompted me to write this warning . kid pix 4 runs in 800x600 resolution but it wo n't force your screen resolution to match that when it runs . kid pix 3 , of course , did . as we are using a lcd monitor with native resolution of 1280 x 1024 , we obviously want to keep the desktop running in this resolution . so now we are faced with 2 options : 1 ) use kid pix 4 with a drastically reduced window ( the drawing and toolbars are in a box surrounded by a huge black screen with the file menus at the very top ) or 2 ) adjust the resolution manually every time someone wants to run or exit the program . i find this unacceptable . customer support is non-existent : if you bought it retail , the learning company wo n't answer your questions and refers you to encore 's website . no patches are available and encore has no way to actually contact them . their faq simply explains how to go to your desktop and adjust your screen resolution to 800x600 . i think this huge oversight and lack of any patch to simply fix the problem speaks volumes for the quality of this release . boo to encore , boo to tlc for allowing their `` brand '' to be junked , boo to broderbund . do n't waste your time
soft	i really like this program . i have purchased three different bible programs for my pda and this one is by far the best of the three .
soft	good product but , it 's kind of too complicated and difficult to set up and fine tune to work the way we required
soft	buyer beware : this program will critically impair your system ! internet loading will be drastically crippled . expect frequent system choppiness due to automatic downloading and background processes . there is no way to close mcafee to get around these drawbacks other than to uninstall . i am going to return this first thing next week . i gave them a few weeks to improve performance with patches and upgrades , but nothing has changed . if only i had read the reviews ahead of time . bottomline : if you do n't mind these side-effects , by all means purchase this program ; mcafee has solid protection . but there are easier ways to get that protection
soft	if you do n't need outlook but do need powerpoint , this is a great value . before , you had to be a student or teacher to get a good price ( full retail $ 150 now ) . office 2003 standard even on ebay is still going for $ 175 plus . this does not offer anything much beyond office 2003 but the new ribbon format is not difficult to learn . also , do n't worry about file formats . you can re-set the default format to prior formats so that anything you send out can be read by earlier versions of microsoft office .
soft	i have used ms streets and trips 2005 and 2006 for over a year . it has some map errors that i wish were updated . i read that the delorme street atlas was far superior , so i bought it . it only took one day for me to find a mountain of problems . not only is the mapping way out of date ( many years ) microsoft streets and trips 2006 maps are far more up to date . on many occasions told me to turn the wrong direction on roads even when the road does n't exist in that direction . it does n't even know the name of some very old roads displays ... '' unknown name '' while driving on very old established roads it tells me to turn onto a road that is actually an elevated overpass that i am driving 30 feet below . the program actually wanted me to get back on the freeway by making a u-turn from an off ramp to an on ramp . i have used microsoft streets in all of these same areas and it is much more usable . the delorme is very confusing and frustrating . i 'm sending it back for a full refund
soft	norton is now owned by the huge behemouth digital river , who have n't a clue how to run support or customer service . they are useless and anything with their grimy mits on it and we take a wide berth of it , would n't consider it . norton used to be top notch , now it is like pouring mollasses into your computer . it interferes with everything . microsoft seems to have given up on them too , as norton has not bothered to interface properly with windows , a consequence being that it is also buggy and problematic . i can only warn you ~ avoid ! ! ! a bad bit of software and a company that has n't any clue about what customer service is and does n't look likely to change . profit seems to be likely more important to them than service or keeping the norton family of software up to date and working well ...
soft	over the last two years , i have found h block 's tax cut software to be simple to use to process an otherwise complex tax return . i would recommend it to anyone who wants a reliable tax preparation source without having to pay the accountant 's fees
soft	i previously had nero 6 and it had tons of bugs for me . i upgraded to 7 ultra enhanced when i upgraded my computer to vista premium , and i was pleasantly surprised . everything i have tried so far has been flawless . it seems that different systems have different results with nero . for example some people say nero 6 works best for them , but on my old system it was horrible ( running on win2k ) . it 's complicated software though , so people should give nero a break . overall they do a great job . just download the trial first and see how it runs on your system .
soft	i recently purchased the anime studio 5 but not the pro version , which costs 150 more and gives more functionality . this is a fully functioning animation software , with lots of interesting features . i can see no reason that a novice animator such as i am would not be happy with this software . i would like to see more energy put into a manual , but you can scavenge the anime blog/chat site to find answers , or google other places . with a more robust manual , this would be 5 stars , not 4 . it is really the reason i am reluctant to upgrade to pro , because i would want more lessons and tutorials to go along with the upgrade . if you have an interest in animating , this is the software for you .
soft	i have the older version which was great but does n't seem to work on win xp . both do a great job especially when you need an emergency card . 2006 edition has a great added feature of being able to choose the size format for your card , big plus . the graphics are nice and there are many choices . it 's a good deal at the price
soft	looked at them all and then bought this software ... it can do a lot of things so , yes , it might take a bit to learn and get fast with . there is a reason it has been voted best for several years now . it does a good job if you remember the very old computer saying , `` garbage in ... garbage out '' 8- ) my wife loves the video tutorials that she can pop-up anytime she needs to without stopping the software and what she 's working on . anything this complete , is worth the learning curve
soft	i 've been using turbotax since 1999 . we run two small companies and my background is in accounting . hence , i have a very hard time giving someone else my bookkeeping and taxes to do , since i really have a hard time letting go of the control ! ( i 've really got to get over that ! ! ) each year , it seems that turbotax does nothing but improve ! i typically delay until the last minute and cram it all in on april 14 , and if it was n't for the simplicity fo this software , i 'd be filing extentions every year . really , gathering all your stuff together is the hardest part . this software does everything else for you .
soft	i installed quickbooks pro 2003 on my new computer running vista and had a small problem . so , i bought an upgrade to 2007 since intuit says it works with vista . it does not . the software crashes at odd times . it also crashes when attempting to call up invoices from the accounts receivable report . it reports out of memory errors and closes two to six times each day . i have set up my old computer , which runs xp , so i can use the new software until they fix all of the glitches in the 2007 version . i recommend not buying this version if you are running vista os
soft	i just bought this cd because i am learning haitian creole , and that 's one of the languages that is supposed to be on this cd . when i installed it , i was unable to find anything on the cd in haitian creole , even though it is listed as one of the languages on the case . so it has been a complete waste of money for me , perhaps if i was interested in the other languages i could give it more stars . it also says in the blurb that u can use any of the 16 languages as the source language , but that is not possible either , u can only chooose a few of the languages as your source . i am very disappointed in the false advertising for this product . if anyone can find creole on this cd i would be happy to stand corrected . ps i contacted imsi and they say the cd 's were mislabelled , there is no haitian creole on the cd , despite the fact that it is listed on the cover
soft	when i got this game , i was very excited to play it . but when i played it , i was very dissapointed . the game was very confusing , and hard to control . sometimes , i could n't get my person to go where i wanted it to go . learn from my mistake . do n't waste your money on this game .
soft	there have been enough changes for the better to make this product well worth the purchase , installation , learning curve
soft	i have a powerbook , an imac , and an emac at home that are used in different ways . the kids use the emac for school work , and my wife i use the other 2 macs for home business . although most school work was required in ms-powerpoint or ms-word , exporting from iwork '06 pages and keynote was very simple to do with 90-95 % accuracy . our kids said they just do minor editing at school before submitting the work . for home business , we use pages to do our proposals , bills , and receipts . and use keynote for presentations . one thing that i thought was amazing , is the fact that i can display the notes and the succeeding slide on my powerbook , while projecting just the current slide for the customer to see . for the price of the family pack , we were licensed to use iwork '06 on 5 macs on the same network . the cost fitted our budget perfectly . the only thing i wish was available in keynote was timed transition ( example : after 3 seconds show bullet # 1 , after 5 seconds show bullet # 2 , after 2 seconds show the chart
soft	it is difficult to use words harsh enough to describe this product and this company . i have owned this software for about 80 days . 1 . in 80 days of use this product has completely locked up or not opened twice . 2 . i have called the 'support ' line 4 times . the minimum time i was on hold was 40 minutes . 3 . my initial 'support ' period is about to expire and i now will have to pay $ 200 to get more 'support ' 4 . you have to buy additional software to get your data onto a palm device . in summary : the product has locked up about every 40 days and the average hold time is 40 minutes when you call them . save yourself the grief - buy nothing or buy something else
soft	this works fairly well for me . it easily downloads the capital gains from microsoft money , the interviews are fairly straightforward . however there are a few areas ( like foreign tax credit ) where it should be automated but is n't . but on the whole it does a nice job , they just need to improve it a little every year then it could be a 5 star item .
soft	first i would like to state that sooner or later every computer user will come in contact with some problem with an internet security program . they are human made and not 100 % fault proof . i study and work in the it field and was first introduced to pc-cillin through trend micro 's product housecall . soon after i tried out the trial and have finally bought the product . i love it ! i have used several of the other `` major '' anti-virus suites available and have had tons of problems with them . mcafee after one uninstall had bedded itself so far into the computer that i had to completely reformat the pc to gain functionality again . norton to say was n't much better . if you are installing on a `` clean '' pc where these other software suites have not been , i have not had a problem . i have installed/uninstalled pc-cillin many times each time running smoothly . the software has been a valuable asset protecting my pcs by alerting me to virus threats and even hacking threats that were not even on my network but on my isps network . as well as protecting my network from one single computer that received a virus by shutting off traffic to that pc . i can understand where some of the other problems reported with this software may occur if the person a beginning user or just unfamiliar with the framework of the software . but if you already have some experience in how to set this type of software up i really do recommend you give pc-cillin a try . it is a sleak program , easy to install , easy to customize , and really goes above and beyond with alerting you to possible risks and threats . with all its competitors out there i would choose pc-cillin over the rest any day of the week
soft	first of all , microsoft needs to come down on their prices ( not that this will ever happen ) . i build computers for a living , and i 'd say that 9 times out of 10 windows is the single most expensive piece of any pc i build . that being said , xp has come a long way . service pack 2 has done wonders for security . i also found it is the most stable version of windows i 've used to date . that 's not to say it does n't have it 's flaws . it still lets in it 's share of `` germs '' , stops responding from time to time ( hangs ) , and it 's very slow to shut down . the built-in cd writing software is terrible and remote desktop is not always a pleasure to use either . however , the biggest problem i 've had so far is with product activation . as a pc technician , i 'm always testing new parts . the most annoying problem i 've had is that after you make a certain number of hardware changes ( let 's say you replace a video card , a hard drive and add some memory ) all within a certain period of time ( 180 days maybe ? ) windows makes you reactivate . this becomes a problem when you have to reactivate twice within this period of time . it makes you call microsoft , where you have to convince the representitive that you 're not trying to steal from them . then you have to read them a long number ( i think 41 digits ) and then they 'll read another long number back to you that you need to type in . it 's driven me to the point of using windows 2000 again to test my parts , even though this is n't always practical for testing xp compatibility . overall , i feel that i paid too much for this operating system .
soft	money has built in value for the none accoundant person . with little or no training a novice can become familar with this software in a very short time . microsoft has a winner
soft	i am amazed what this program can do . it is a big difference from ps 5.5 . it is a new learning curve but well worth it . what used to take me hours to do is now an action and done in 2 minutes . amazon had the best price for me from a source i trust ordering from . it is worth it
soft	i was very excited to get this product . it scans well , files well , is very sexy and promising . then i decided to search for a few files based on my keywords . oooops ! it wo n't search ! ! if you do n't know already , paperport offers you only one free tech support call . after that it 's $ 20 a pop . the rather surly technician i reached had me re-install my program . okay , but it still would n't search . then he told me to un-install windows service pack 2 . uh uh , no way . nada . that 's when i asked for a refund . i bought mycab for $ 40 . tech support is marvelous , within one hour over the internet . the only thing it does n't do is scan within the program , but then i can do that , ca n't i ? ak napa , c
soft	i have this program on a 30-day demo . it might be ok if i did n't mind my computer becoming almost unusable . i tried to run the system virus scan , as recommended , but after 3 hours it was only 2 % done because it was stuck on a file it could n't seem to get past . i skipped the file , but then it quickly got stuck again . the `` time remaining '' said it would take 4 days to complete , so i cancelled that scan . it has a learning mode that initally blocks everything . apparently , this program has no brain . for example , i have the live search toolbar installed in outlook . it had to ask me if it was ok to run that dll file . in fact , each program that called up a process from a shared dll has to ask permission before it could run . do n't even get me started on the quickbooks and internet explorer problems . which is what it would n't let those programs do , even after they had been run and i repeated clicked `` allow '' over and over . twice today it got so slow running ie that it finally crashed the computer so bad that i had to do a hard re-boot . if you have it checking ports on your computer , almost nothing would run or download on ie . so , i 'm going to demo a few more , but it 's probably back to windows live onecare , which i had the past year . it just does n't seem to do much ( no long list of features ) , but it also does n't jam everthing else up
soft	i should have listened to the other reviewers ... i wanted to replace my c : drive with a faster one , and ghost 10.0 says it can do it , but do n't be fooled . even if you follow the extra steps from their support site ( which are not in the documentation ) , you will end up with an unusable copy that will boot up but then fail with assorted catastrophic errors . it will also give you occasional error messages that are neither in the documentation nor on their support site . a friend recommended acronis trueimage which i ended using instead . it 's much easier to use , copies about 2x faster than ghost , and best of all it works . i cloned and replaced c drives from two laptops in a couple of hours with no problems .
soft	i found it hard to work with and was disappointed that it was n't more versatile . my needs are not quite the same as a standard business , however , and i have friends with businesses who like this very much .
soft	i did n't encounter any problems with this product infact it was much easier to use and it allows you to combine and orginaze text files , chart spreadsheets , drawings , pdf documents and more into a single compressed package with advanced security features it also has many tools , overall this product was fantastic and i can not recommend this highly enough . the interface and toolbars might be annoying but that is just a slight problem since it can be taken down and become more user friendly . the other reviewers who complained about this being slower need to know that this is just the standard edition which i use , there is a better edition which is the professional full product of adobe acrobat 7.0 that also includes an upgrade ... ..
soft	found the registration number difficult to read . had to have customer service tell me that they run into this all the time ! the i 's look like 1 's . tried it again ! i got it to load . my computer slowed down significantly ! certain sites i could not access anymore without re-configuring the software . i have used norton . mcaffee or whatever , and other suite type security software . this one was the worst . i would not recommend it . i got a well deserved refund
soft	i do not have any recolection of purchasing this product , nor can i find it on my computer or in any of my hard non computer files . i have always ordered a hard disk back up of all purchases from zone alarm . there is no hard disk no computer file . i am about to raise you know what about this charge on my credit card . i will challenge it if i do not receive for what i am being charged . i will also ask my credit card co. for a new number to prevent future charges from these folks . in the future i will use a third party encryted method for purchases on the internet . rehadik @ netscape
soft	you can read it before buying the product by looking on the za site . i 'm going to make this hard and make you google it . i 'm not going to criticize anyone except to say if you have a question or problem , the za website lists pdf file user manuals for all of the company 's products . there are some compatibility probs for example with yahoo mail beta . as soon as yahoo finalizes it 's mail server za will be compatible . simply switch back to yahoo mail ( pre beta ) . there are several other beta products but generally if you 're having problems they can be easily fixed by adjusting the settings just like all security programs . za really is better at what it is suppose to do than other products once you have learned how to use it . kinda like most things in the world of things that are unfamiliar . i use the free stuff too , and recommend them for those who are on a budget - students , etc . but the za suite is worth the money and is more effective for those who ca n't afford to get mugged or pickpocketed on the info hiway . i know what you 're thinking btw ... but ask yourself `` is your private information , time and computer worth it to you ? '' if so go with zone alarm , learn how to use it and be safer on the net . john row in1ea
soft	i first heard about this product in a bad review of a different software product for converting lps to cds . after a little research , i decided to try this product of the many that are out there . this software is not expensive and for me , it does what i expected it to do . it is easy to set up and use , and i am using it with an audio-technica pl120 turntable . the first lp i converted was stevie wonder 's innervisions , and with this album in particular , the songs run together , i.e . there is no separation between the tracks . this software allowed me to create fairly accurate tracks so i could access individual songs . i also cleaned up some background noise with the `` one click '' noise reduction , and the music from this old album sounds great . this is my first software for this purpose so unfortunately i can not compare it to others . what i can tell you is that it is inexpensive , easy to use , and it does what it says it will do
soft	the program crashed during setup . when i finally got it installed , it crashed my machine every night until i uninstalled it .
soft	if you have not bought this yet , do n't . if you have , but have n't installed it yet , do n't . i 've used quicken for years , and this is the worst implentation yet . the major problem , an issue known to the company , is that reports will not print properly on many printers . wait until they issue a fix before you use this product
soft	really neat program and it may be a tad over my head right now . the tutorial is helping a great deal . i am positive that i will find all the right buttons
soft	microsoft office pro 2003 edition is a good product . it installed easily over office pro 1997 . i have n't had any problems with it ( yet ) . it relies heavily on online links , you probably should have a fast dsl connection or broadband if you are going to use the online links . update : i am using windows xp with office pro 2003 and today was disappointed to find that the help menu is not as user friendly or helpful as earlier editions
soft	great product , has more features then just cd/dvd burning , system backup , numerous audio recording , editing features , lightscribe and it 's also vista compatible . the only downside is it 's learning curve some features and options are complex , but once mastered you will be more then pleased with this product .
soft	i purchased turbo tax after reading the reviews here ... someone had mentioned a glitch , but someone else mentioned a work around . bottom line , if you can sit down with all your records and do the whole turbo tax from start to finish in one swoop , you 're fine . but if you need to start and stop while completing the schedule 2 business aspects of your tax return , get ready for a huge problem ... it does n't let you back in ! i went to their website where they had both a work around , and a report that if you update your turbo tax ( very easy ) the glitch will be fixed . not so , it did nothing for me . then i tried the workarounds ... i got back in once but the next time i tried to use the work around a few days later , it did not work . i ended up having to call an accountant 1 week before the 17th and thank goodness i was able to get an appointment . also , if you have a business and do n't understand some of the tax workings , like depreciation , it is very difficult to translate your former accountant 's previous year 's work into the new turbotax . it 's not set up that way , so you need to know what you 're doing . i have a college degree and a lot of stick-to-it-ness , but i could not figure out and be sure that i was entering things correctly . and then , it did n't matter anyway , as i could n't get in to change anything in the end . finally , make sure you save , save , save as you go ! while doing my turbo tax and having spent a couple of hours already , i logged into their website to get some support . when i `` x '' ed out of the internet page , it closed my turbotax screen that i 'd opened on my computer . guess what ? it was all lost and i had to start from the beginning . that was before i was even impacted by the `` glitch '' later . this program does not remind you to save when you close , or ask you if you want to save , so be sure and save all the time ! so , good luck to anyone who tries this . for me , it was a huge disappointment and i am returning it to amazon for a refund due to the glitch . i honestly do n't know how they can sell something with such an obvious problem .
soft	many repetitions are necessary in order to acquire a second language or a third , but the monotony of this program does not keep your interest for long , is so boring and offers not variety at all . this program will take away the excitement for learning another language even for the most motivated individuals , and will not help to acquire fluency because it does not equip you with the tools to construct language on your own . it does not contain essential grammar instruction , it is an error to suppose that the same grammatical rules of your language can be applied to other languages ( french is not a translation of english , or spanish , or any other language ) . grammar becomes essential especially when you are trying to construct correct structures on your own ; this program claims to help you learn `` naturally '' but leaves huge gaps by neglecting grammar , culture , conversational structures , and clear understanding , not natural ! for adults translation is necessary when trying to internalize the concepts , adults already have an understanding of language and are equipped to learn differently than children , sometimes even faster . i do not believe that `` learning a second language like a child '' is an accurate statement to describe this program , children are immersed in the culture , everything around them is the `` real deal '' , not repetitious pictures and recordings . children receive verbal and non-verbal input constantly , and adults have greater cognition than children do . looking at a picture while you listen a recoding might give you a vague idea of what it means , but there is not accuracy . it is very unlikely that you will internalize a concept that you do not fully understand . rosetta stone approach might be very effective when memorizing vocabulary and simple sentences , but i could achieve the same by purchasing flash cards for a fraction of the cost of this overrated , and overpriced program .
soft	i work at best buy and we install this piece of garbage all the time . for one its a huge system hog and two it does n't catch much of the pesky spyware . also when computers come in to be cleaned up , no one uses this program ( even though we 're `` supposed '' to recommend it ) . i would recommend xoft , pest patrol , or ms antispyware much much more .
soft	eb own words : `` unfortunately , at this time the britannica software is not compatible with windows vista . we are working on developing another version of the 2007 software that will work on windows vista and we are planning to release this version in the upcoming months . please check back with us in another month or so and we should have some more information about the vista-compatible software . but , it is entirely possible that we will not have windows vista compatible version of the 2007 product available and that we will wait until the development of the 2008 software .

soft	taxcut has been very reliable information and easy to use when preparing your taxes . i have used it over the past several years . updates are easy to download and the software is great . this year the software arrived on a usb key . this is the easiest and best way to obtain the software . small , easy to store and is reusable . i will continue to use taxcut in the future
soft	i use pdfs a lot and i must say that quite often i turn to free pdf software to actually do the tasks that acrobat fails to do . one area i have always had a problem with is the formatting of some documents in size and sometimes acrobat simply fails to recognize them and so i switch to the free pdf software which has no problems doing this and is easier to use . however if you are a pro pdf maker who wants to add sigs and links and notes and chapters and all the other function tags including security tags then i recommend this product hands down as the best one . i just find that it is not always the best pdf software package in the world , but a good one all the same . i would not recommend buying this one just to make standard pdf files alone . if you want to touch up those file then this is what you need to do that right .

soft	several years ago i used delorme 's street atlas with a usb gps receiver . the software worked but the interface was lousy . this year i tried microsoft 's streets and trips 2007 and was surprised to find that it has an interface that is smoother in some ways than the delorme software , but still surprisingly clumsy . and the help is possibly the worst i have seen in a microsoft product ( that 's saying a lot ) . here are some of the problems : 1 . street trips is expecting a gps receiver that uses a **com port** . are you kidding me ? in 2007 ? ? ? the delorme earthmate 20 ( usb ) will work if you use the delorme com port emulation software , but why is this necessary ? ? ? ( and it was not trivial to get it to work . ) 2 . the handling of pushpins ( identifying spots on the map ) , favorite places , and the like , is extremely clumsy . ( although , contrary to another review , you do n't to re-enter the information each time . you just save the file and reload it . ) 3 . directions are sometimes not so great . why would you instruct someone to `` turn left '' if you do n't know which direction they 're pointing ( e.g. , when you 're stationary in a parking lot ) ? much better in such cases to say `` head ne '' or some such . freeway exits ( at least in so . california ) were often not handled well . ( one freeway entrance was identified as a `` local road '' , which at the time proved quite confusing . ) 4 . why does n't the software automatically recalculate directions to put you `` on-route '' once you 're off-route ? you can push f3 , but why is this necessary ? 5 . i never got the voice providing driving guidance to work . the online help was useless . i 'm sure someone can jump in and tell me how to do it , but it should be trivial . 6 . in general , the software has the feel of a bunch of modules written independently and thrown together . i 'm not a reflexive anti-microsoft bigot ( i bought this software after all ) , but i find that much ms software is bad precisely because it feels like it 's cobbled together without much attention given to integration . it 's shiny on the surface but the shine vanishes once you really start to use it . given this experience , i will probably give the delorme software another try next time around .
soft	when i tried this program out , i at first had some trouble running it . but then i went to the website at : www.kutoka.com and click on the support tab and then select easyspeak spanish . they give you a link for the version of flash 8 you need to run . after this everything worked well . while some may have been offended by bathing suits . not me and not my kids . there is absolutly nothing obscene here folks . this program is the best thing going for learning spanish quickly ! and it is fun to use with the many games and puzzles that you work out with real life scenerios . very artistic and fun . you can go to the bank , the hospital , and several different places , learn a new set of words and situations . that you could really use in a foreign country . my hats off to the designers and creators of this program . well done ! ! bravo ! muy bien .
soft	i have used this procuct in the past with great success , but ghost 10 is useless . symantec tech support is ( as far as i can tell , been doing computers since 1957 ) the worst . if you get the boxed version it says pc magzine september 2004 `` belongs in every serious pc user 's toolbox . '' think about it using a 2004 quote . in 2004 and 2005 i would agree . the 1st sys i installed ghost 10 is a dell xpx600 , boot disk will not work , backup will not work , blue screen when backing up . tech support directed me to web sites that do n't exist , and the sites that did come up did n't have the files nu tech listed . dell workstations 530 and 360 both dual processor , no games , 15,000 scsi raid , 4gb mem , 1gb nvidia , dual displays -- they crashed and had to be reformated and reinstalled . system works 2005 expired i could n't use my ghost 9 backups , and i kept getting virus pop ups that were generated by nu , the systems were shipped to panama and were in customs for over 6 mo this is not a usual event in the life of a computer , but with no tech support and my computers only starting long enough to tell me sys works was not up to date i reformated . i purchased ( in anticipation of setting up my computers ) boxed from amazon and download from nu ghost 10 , sys wrks prem , nu int sec ( 2007 versions ) but could n't install them . that was mid december 2006 , now its january 19 , 2007 and still not one answer from nu that works , yes all systems are pluged in to tripplite smart3000rmu tripplite line condidtoners ( 2 batery backup units ) , the computers lived in st maarten and the power was 105 to 140 volts with lots of downtime . panama weather , people , public offices are great ( driver lic $ 24 lic plates $ 30 for 3 years , st maarten driver lic $ 450 for 2 years , lic plates $ 400 yr ) sailing is better in st maarten . life in panama ( and i do n't speek spanish yet ) is good norton is bad . l read a lot mostly tech books , i purchase tools , electronic gear , software , computer hardware , etc without amazon it would be hard to live offshore , no need to go to borders , amazon is online 24 7 .
soft	one thing you will find reading through many reviews is a dissatisfaction with the state filings . this is my own experience and this may be the last year i use taxcut because of it . first of all , it would not allow me to e-file my state return but did n't explain why . i later discovered that for most states you apparently ca n't e-file a partial year return . then when printing out the state return it told me i had to also include a form that was mentioned nowhere else in the program . i later found out that taxcut does not support all state tax forms ! i then had to get that form and fill it in manually , and then discovered i owed less than before because taxcut had incorrectly calculated my capital gains . and there was nothing on the missing state form that could not have been completed with data the program already had . taxcut also advised me i could save $ 1000 off my fed bill by contributing to an ira . so i opened and ira and contributed $ 4000 . when i went back to taxcut and entered the details it told me i was n't eligible for any tax deduction . i was ready to be tied up ! this software is seriously dysfunctional . i 'm guessing by this stage you get the idea . bottom line : i will be looking elsewhere to complete my tax returns next year . oh , by the way , if like me you were unable to efile and you paid for the efile option , you can get a credit from h by calling 1-888-4taxcut option 2,2,0

soft	the fact that they call this premier is a little overdone . the reality is that this is the `` pro '' version with a few bells and whistles which in most cases do not warrant the additional price

soft	installed this on my laptop and desktop computers . one installation was late in 2005 , the other was in 2nd quarter of 2006 . both have tried to fail . the laptop will no longer do automatic updates . i can manually download and install the updates , but it is a bit of a hassle . the desktop will no longer download the symantec updates at all . i attempted several uninstalls and reinstalls , wo n't do it . the only remedy is to take both computers to a computer shop and needlessly pay someone to fix the mess this junk software has made on both computers . because of the problems , i 've run into several problems , mostly related to .cab files when i attempt downloads . i 've switched to avg and zone alarm - both free and they work
soft	although it says that this works for all versions of photoshop it does not upgrade from photoshop elements . i spoke with customer service and they would not give me the code to unlock it
soft	i 'm not a spider-man fan . i love powers , the ultimates , supreme power , planetary and other stuff by warren ellis , brian michael bendis , et.al . so when i bought this , i wondered if spending a whopping $ 49 would be worth it . i wanted to read straczynski 's recent run of spider-man , but if i was going to spend about $ 20 on a graphic novel , why not spend a little more for the whole thing . and that 's just what you get . in addition to getting straczynski 's 4-year run ( which includes spider-man 's evolution and discovery of his totemic powers ) , you get everything leading up to june 2006 ( which is just like 3 issues ago ! ) . and all on 1 dvd-rom . true , the cons are that when it comes to crossovers , you only get the amazing spider-man stories and reading it off your computer is n't as fun as reading the actual comics -- but that does n't compare to getting the entire run . it 's like complaining about getting a free ps3 , xbox360 and nintendo wii , because the box did n't come with it or you 're missing one controller . $ 50 may seem steep , but if comics cost $ 3 now , so for the price of like one or two months worth of comics -- or for 2 books , you get everything . and it 's true , you can just print out the pages if you want ( so if you want to abuse your office or school 's printer , go for it !
soft	darkbasic is only good for people very new to programming and interested in games . to make a commercial-quality game in this language would be lunacy , basic just is n't quite flexible enough to do that with ease , and the darkbasic renderer looks very , very ugly . however , basic remains very easy to learn and darkbasic has some commands that are fun to toy with . if you 're trying to get into serious game development , learn c++ and either learn how to use libraries like opengl or directx , or start modding a popular engine like the unreal engine or source . and make sure you 've learned a good deal of physics and math
soft	i 've spent all day putting together a 300 page book in corel draw , the file was saved several times without error , the finished piece is 2.6 gb . i exported it as a pdf that is 4.5 gb . never any errors in corel draw . acrobat wo n't open the pdf . says it 's corrupted . now when i open the cdr all i get is a single page , and when i right click on the file and look at the properties it says it 's 0 pages . i 'm really upset , and now i 've wasted an entire day with corel 's software , if the thing is just for 1 or 2 page church brochures corel should warn people on the package . it looks like i 'm sol and i 'm guessing corel will never bother with a reply . hint : i think i 'll switch to adobe . sincerely , waitman gobbl
soft	i liked everything about this product except it is a little too slow at times . i always shoot with nikon raw format . it has hung a couple of times and i had to kill it after waiting for 10-15 minutes .
soft	this world renown editor is the best when it comes to editing and managing your digital photo
soft	first of all , microsoft needs to come down on their prices ( not that this will ever happen ) . i build computers for a living , and i 'd say that 9 times out of 10 windows is the single most expensive piece of any pc i build . that being said , xp has come a long way . service pack 2 has done wonders for security . i also found it is the most stable version of windows i 've used to date . that 's not to say it does n't have it 's flaws . it still lets in it 's share of `` germs '' , stops responding from time to time ( hangs ) , and it 's very slow to shut down . the built-in cd writing software is terrible and remote desktop is not always a pleasure to use either . however , the biggest problem i 've had so far is with product activation . as a pc technician , i 'm always testing new parts . the most annoying problem i 've had is that after you make a certain number of hardware changes ( let 's say you replace a video card , a hard drive and add some memory ) all within a certain period of time ( 180 days maybe ? ) windows makes you reactivate . this becomes a problem when you have to reactivate twice within this period of time . it makes you call microsoft , where you have to convince the representitive that you 're not trying to steal from them . then you have to read them a long number ( i think 41 digits ) and then they 'll read another long number back to you that you need to type in . it 's driven me to the point of using windows 2000 again to test my parts , even though this is n't always practical for testing xp compatibility . overall , i feel that i paid too much for this operating system .
soft	since tax cut decided not to produce a mac version this year , i got stuck with turbo tax . their website promises that one may import data from the previous year 's tax cut return . then you buy the thing , and you find out that it requires you to load the turbo tax program and your 2004 tax cut data onto a windows machine , transfer there , then load it back onto the mac for this to work . so , like a chump i borrowed a friend 's windows machine and did all this . but , it does n't work . not at all . and it takes a lot of time to find that out . tried every workaround i could think of . nope . it does n't work .
soft	it 's just too complex compared to print shop 21 and as far as i can tell it has very few added features . ray gawronsk
soft	i bought this for a boy of 12 who goes to school in german . he speaks english at home with his mother . i think that this game will help him with his english
soft	this is the worst software i have ever worked with , everything is difficult and some things are impossible to create .
soft	the product was easy to install but there was a trick i noticed . a day after installing the software i ran full scan . to try the sincerity of the software , i downloaded same free trial . to my chagrin i was told my computer has about 420 problems and could only fix about 15 . my question now is are all these gimmicks
soft	freezes ie 7 and you have to close out and restart ... besides that , the other problem is slow printing because you have to use the `` print as image '' selection for anything that is scanned . overall it is ok , and with the vast price difference with adobe , i can live with it . but , make no mistake , this program is far inferior to the adobe product
soft	this product simply does not produce accurate results . it skips entire lines , words on the same line , and misreads even the most legible characters . it came bundled with my scanner , so at least i did not waste my money on it . do n't waste yours
soft	no support or response to questions , only 1/2 of the functions work , not a bad design but it was obviously released full of bugs . try cosmic blobs
soft	this lame program is completely limiting . you can not even type in your own text . you are supposed to use the few quotes they want you to use . it is not at all user friendly either . i am so sorry i purchased this
soft	it 's quite a bit slower than version 7 . but it looks really good and the form designer has been improved by leaps and bounds
soft	this was given to my son who is going to be living in china this summer and presently knows no chinese . he 's worked hard with this program and at least appears to be getting the tonal quality correct which is key in this language . a microphone is a must with this program . only wish it focused on certain key words other than phrases that would never be used , like `` an old man driving a car ''
soft	this game can get very boring . it 's very confusing and hard to control . it is sooooo frustrating ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the instruction booklet does n't come in handy either . like some other people , i only got rabbits too . i bought this game because i wanted to heal cats and horses . but , only rabbits came . buying this game was a big mistake . it is reallly no fun . do n't waste your money on this game . i gave up about a month ago . i 've left it on the shelf and have n't touched it since .
soft	i put ms works on all systems that i make for other people . it has everything they need , and it dose n't break the bank . the only thing i do n't like is that there is no presentation software , or powerpoint clone . then again , if they included that , ms office sales would go down a lot ! !
soft	product is excellent does what it says and then some . instruction for installation and operating are very easy to follow ( a winner in my book ) . i had issues unrelated to this product running into problems with the stereo i was using in the fact that it did n't have outputs for audio so i was forced to use the headphone jack which required further purchasing adapters for the rca cable was a bit frustrating but had nothing to do with this product . i converted 2 albums last night into wav files cleaned them up with the audio cleaner included in the software . used the editing ripper included to split the 1 recording into separate tracks , actually the software does that for you but you have the option to preview there start and ending points for each of the tracks in case it may be off . i only had minor adjustments the ripper was pretty much on the money , overall . i then downloaded the encoder recommended to work with this software and converted the wav files into mp3 's with no problem . this is an excellent buy for those out there looking to do there own audio transfer of lp 's and cassettes . the sound is excellent on playback .
soft	6.6 ultra is an extremely good cd/dvd burning suite . it even has an excellent schedule-able backup/restore utility that burns to disk . do not use the oem version - it 's like diet nero . and do not for any reason get nero 7.0 . you have less than a 50 % chance that it will work at all . ( i am speaking from experience here !
soft	easy tax preparation and lots of information , videos , and help . i even bought stock in intuit because i also use their quicken product . awsome products ... no wonder microsoft had their eye on it before
soft	i bought this for my child who uses it at school and loves it . i have a mac pro running the latest version of mac os . i installed it and it needs to run on 800x600 resolution , which is kind of silly in this day-and-age , but that works ok. what does not work is that it crashes about every 5 minutes . pretty unworkable . do n't bother buying this for a mac
soft	i used this to help plan kitchen and bathroom makeovers . it helped me see just what we wanted
soft	this game was a little too hard for my tastes . despite the fact that i played at the junior level i managed to get killed shortly after starting out . i also had to restart the game to figure out what my room number was because once i left the room i could n't find my way back ( all the corridors look alike ) . so far i 've fallen down an elevator shaft , gotten caught breaking and entering , been crushed by an elevator , frozen to death and been hit over the head ... i 've got to ask is this really appropriate for children
soft	a great program . pretty easy to use . you have to play around with it to learn all the things it will do . i bought it usedfrom a list on amazon and it was fine . really like the program . linda j johnso
soft	wonderful game a true challange for any die hard friends fan two big thumbs up ! ! ! !
soft	all i wanted was a way to identify some files , remember which ones so every time i wanted to backup , i would press `` go '' and the backup would start . alohabob was too `` smart '' for my use . first , it has this intelligent file finder that finds what is likely to be backed up . i indicate that i want to select my own files ( which it lets me think i can do ) . then thinking it would bring me to browser window -- no , no , no ... it still needs to waste time doing its indexing as if i had selected the `` smart find '' . i then manually select my files ( great ! ! ) . in trying to save the `` template '' of what files i wanted to backup , it requires that i make it a reoccurring backup with selected backup frequency ( yuk ! ! ) . i want to back up when i get to it ( about once a month , not when it wants to -- i am backing up to a dvd which i need to put in the drive ) . ok , so now i am over that and the backup begins - great ! ! ! upon returning into the application a month later , i can not select my saved `` template '' to `` run now '' , it will run when it is scheduled to run : ( so ... i need to repeat the whole process just to get the same files as last time backed up . i exchanged emails with the company and they understood but were not going to `` add '' the features i described . oh well - it looked like such a promising product . now i need to find another that satisfies my requirements
soft	i bought the mac version of turbotax premier , and i installed it on my mac with os 10.3.9 . after doing my entire return , i clicked to e-file and received a message saying , `` could not load attribute , '' this error box gave me the options to continue ( which just took me back to the e-file page , which led me to the same error message ) or connect to intuit online support . the intuit support site said , `` this error occurs when attempting to file electronically . if you are connecting through a router , try bypassing the router and filing again . if the error persists , it may be necessary to file by paper . we are currently working to resolve this error . . . . to be notified as soon as we have an answer , click here to sign up . '' i do n't have the technical know-how to `` bypass the router . '' i also figured that if intuit had n't solved the problem by march 26 ( the day i was ready to submit my return ) , they probably were n't going to , even if i were willing to hold onto my return until i 'd received word they 'd solved the problem . so i ended up mailing in my return . if i 'd known up front that i would n't be able to e-file , i probably would n't bought the program .
soft	i purchased elements because frankly , i could n't afford the whole big adobe enchilada.i have found it to be pretty intuitive.lots and lots of options as to organization , photo-tweaking and such . i have had a lot of fun messing around with the program and my digital photos . i do have two other imaging programs , and with the addition of elements , i feel like i 'm basically well-set with zillions of options.plus , there are several web sites dedicated to digital photography , and they supply free downloads of photoshop samples , such as `` textures , '' and so on.very helpful . get this if you ca n't spring for the complete photoshop program . you will not be disappointed
soft	the only redeeming quality about this gps system is that it 's cheap . i used it on a 1,000 mile trip on the east coast the week after i got it . the navigation is poor . i found that i often had to look over to the laptop screen because i was `` off route '' so often due to the poor maps . the system repeated the same annoying problems that i see in other feedback . 1 ) the unit would show me being off the road even though i was on an interstate . in this case it would continually recalculate the route and diretc me to take exits to get off the highway and circle around . 2 ) it directed me to make turns onto one-way streets in the wrong direction . 3 ) it could not locate a poi that turned out to be a few hundred yards away 4 ) it often did not know the correct side of the road for my destination 5 ) it does n't provide a chime when it 's time for a turn . it will tell you the turn is a half-mile ahead , but that might be the last time you hear an instruction . 6 ) in one case , it got me to my destination ( at least close enough ) but could n't guide me back to my starting point . the gps receiver seemed to acquire and hold the satellite signal well . but the maps are poor , as is the verbal instruction - it sounds like a 1980 's computer generated voice . if you 're looking for a trustworthy guide in unfamiliar areas - this is n't it . this is going back asap .
soft	i have a question about this . i 'm wondering if i can hook my guitar into my computer and record it and then like add drums and loops an stuff onto it . is that possible on this program ? cause my friend has acid pro 4.0 and that is really awesome but it 's like $ 400 and i dont have that kinda money . wut i liked about acid pro 4.0 is that you could hook up ur guitar to the computer and stuff like that , so im wondering if you can do that on this program . if u have an answer for me , e-mail me at peepilott @ aol.com .

soft	this always was a microsoft good program , who needs know how be and for where , this is a good choic
soft	most of the world still runs on pcs and as a mac owner ( and lover ) , it can be tough to find software for basic stuff like accounting . i 'm a guy who makes a living making stuff sound good for radio , tv , video games and so on . as a freelancer , i need something to keep track of my business banking , credit cards , expenses and invoices and this program does just that and very intuitively , just like my mac . i used myob -- a mac accounting program -- but found it to be tricky and did n't end up with the comprehensive reports for my accountant that i expected and wound up going over everything expense by expense and invoice by invoice for hours . it could be that i did n't understand the program well enough , but support is extra everytime you call customer service for help , so no thanks myob . in fact , i put off doing most of my 2006 accounting until january 2007 because i dreaded trying to figure out myob again . then i broke down and bought quickbooks for mac . it did everything i needed it to -- a year 's worth of accounting in a weekend and i never even cracked the manual . it allowed me to save the year as a pc file to hand to my accountant on a cd . a few days later he handed me back a cd with a mac file of my adjusted accounting and my corp taxes were done and sent . i ca n't speak for anyone with really advanced accounting needs because i never got that deep into the program , but for my needs it 's right on the money .
soft	this program is average to below average in it 's abilities . that said , just hope you do n't need any roxio tech support . why ? because roxio 's support bites ! you can not contact anyone online or by email for help ; whenever their dis-functional `` web portal '' [ web-based support ] system traps you in an endless loop . i needed an couple simples updates for a pc that is not allowed on the internet . it used to be you could download roxio 's patches from any pc having internet access . then burn patch [ s ] to a cd , or copy to floppy/jumpdrive . then `` sneakernet '' the patches to the pc needing them . no more . what happened today was that their webpage was apparently trying to download/patch a roxio product directly on my pc . [ ezcd5 does n't exist on my pc ] . instead of simply letting me download it somewhere , like to my hard drive , vs patchging it directly from their webpage to my pc , [ which wo n't work in my case as i 'm not using roxio , nor have it installed on my pc ] ; apparently the morons that did the roxio webpage coding make the download/patch process stop/end and proceed to send the customer back to roxio 's initial patch download page . when you need a patch , all these endless loops and support games are enough to get me looking for a different product/different company . if you want to minimize human contact with customers , fine . but let folks at least download the patches they need in order to keep their pc going . do n't hand over your customer support system [ almost ] completely to a web server . that ignorant arrangement works about as well as when companies try to save a few pennies and get rid of phone receptionists for customer service telephone calls . then they let customers wade through a 100 layer deep voicemail system to find the answer to a simple problem . it just does n't work . if a company wo n't provide access to patches , even after i have logged into their website with username and password , [ so they know is accessing their patches ] and they do n't offer any type of ftp site as a download backup option , then i sure as heck wo n't be buying anymore of their products . i see why roxio bought up cequadrat and other companies . [ though i hate to see such quality companies be devoured like that ] . when a competitor has a better product , why fight to improve your prodsuct 's quality/features , when you can buy the other company out . thank goodness nero is not under the roxio umbrella .
soft	this software came with a scanner i recently purchased and i decided to upgrade from the `` se '' ( striped edition ? ) that was bundled with the device . considering the cost and what the software can do it is an amazing value . by simply using this software to re-create documents instead of retyping them is saving me more an hour or two a day . i was hesitant to puchse it based upon all the recent negative reviews , but decided with the 30 day refund policy i could try it risk free . i 'm glad i did . the software worked flawlessly for me - even on 5th and 6th generation copies that were hard to read with my naked eye ( and i do n't need or wear glasses ) . i 'm not sure what those people that were scanning books were trying to accomplish , but when i scanned some pages from an encyclopedia for my son the ocr worked great ! try it and if it does n't work then return it .
soft	i recently purchased the software above only to find it does not support my dvd drive ( hl-dt-st rw/dvd gcc-4482b ( 1.00 ) i have unsuccessfully tried to contact roxio support three times . no response . i did go through the long list of supported drives and also emailed my problem to roxio . needless to say , i am very disappointed and do not recommend the purchase of this software . i have a new gateway desktop that came with the above drive .
soft	the product works pretty much as advertised and i received it in a fairly timely manner
soft	super simple to install , and easy to use . this program gives you a real perspective of how you use your money . i created a `` personal '' account company . it does n't have to be for small business only , but will be handy if we decide to set up a small business in the future . the price was just right for our purpose .
soft	there is no excuse for norton not advising of the incompatibility of this antivirus software with popular firewalls such as zonealarm before installing the software , especially since previous versions have been compatible . once opened , returning the product can be a problem , perhaps that it what norton is counting on
soft	i had a problem at the end of the process in that the program indicated no errors , but when you went to print the return , the message stated that there were errors on the return . i contacted turbo tax directly , but they had no explanation . they simply said that they had received a couple of calls about this problem . that was it
soft	this is unbelievable -- -it can tell the importance of the stuff on my pc . and i also can set a weekly backup task on my pc . this is fantastic . it is so straigh forward and easy to use . i will definately recommend this product to everyone i know . well done , alohabob ! ! !

soft	inport , excellent job , i love the product and would highly recommend it to anyone . i 've had several hundred lps sitting in boxes in the basement for years and now i 'm rediscovering that music all over again as i transfer the lps to the digital age . the quality of the transfer is very good ( imo ) . for example , i was playing back so . central rain ( early rem ) in itunes and noticed that i had purchased the song on itunes about a year ago . except for an opening click on the lp version , its very hard to tell the difference between the two . my only minor negative ( or really , feature request ) would be for lpripper to somehow integrate and automate song titles from the albums so that i do n't have to type them all in .
soft	i recently purchased an hp laptop that , to my regret , came with a pre-load of win vista . some of the bad things about this package are : 1 . the help files are all on line . if i 'm not connected to the internet , i ca n't access the help files . 2 . hp does ship it 's laptops with the vista install cd 's . instead , a cd to purchase an upgrade to the next version of vista is included . 3 . for the newer laptops , hp is not producing drivers for any other os except vista . 4 . vista is less user friendly than xp or even 2000 . 5 . and yes , vista looks familiarly like os x , but is harder to work with . i have owned several apples and looks are deceiving . just because it looks like an apple does n't mean it works like one . 6 . all of my instructional software no longer works . i use a lot of software to teach information security that no longer works on vista , such as : a. cyberciege ( an information security wargame ) b. boson ccna network simulator c. visual studio ( not everything works ) 7 . also , some of the network management tools will not run or run properly on vista . i do a lot of remote management from the workstation versus going to the server . many of the vendors that provide tools are way behind the power curve on their vista support . i could go on but what 's the point ? i ca n't even dump vista to go back to windows xp or even 2000 if hp wo n't even make an attempt to produce drivers for the laptop . linux is out for the same reason , no drivers . so i 'm basically stuck with an overpriced emailer and word processor . if you plan on purchasing a computer , make sure that if you plan on dumping the os and going back to xp or changing to linux , the vendor has all of the drivers to support the change is not on the microsoft vista conspiracy bandwagon

soft	i 've been using quicken for over a decade , and i have to admit it is critical to my personal financial management . but i had no reason to upgrade from quicken 2004 until intuit decided to `` break '' it and force the upgrade by crippling certain features . quicken 2007 for mac 's feature set is not significantly different from the 2004 version , much less 2005 or 2006 , and is certainly inferior to quicken for windows . that 's bad enough but quicken 2007 is also way less stable than my prior version ( i 'm using the r2 update ) . it crashes frequently . bottom line , intuit should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for putting this garbage on the market . i for one will never buy another one of their products and recommend the same for everyone else out there

soft	that 's exactly where my cd went . in the garbage . that 's where all the other roxio software i 've ever owned has ended up . at least i never had to spend extra for their junk . it 's always came as part of a peripheral or pc software package . no printed manuals are ever provided and it 's always an issue trying to download one from the roxio website ... which i would then have to print at my expense . i could live with the on-screen manual if the software was n't buggy and they provided some sort of customer support . i ca n't believe that this company is still in business . i guess that they survive by making deals with peripheral and pc manufacturers to stick their customers with inferior software . be advised ... ... do n't be fooled by their slick packaging and website . read the reviews here and elsewhere
soft	this year , instead of renewing my subscription to norton system works 2004 , i thought would be a good idea to bring it up to date . i purchased norton system works 2007 . the 2004 version worked fine for several years , while the 07 version could not be installed on my xp professional pc . the norton `` consumer firewall '' worked perfectly . they make it very hard to get effective help ( unless you want to pay them $ 9.95 per call ) . several sessions on their complementary `` live chat '' system proved useless . in the end , efforts to resolve the problems simply wasted an otherwise perfectly good weekend . i returned the product to norton for a refund . their return procedures indicate that i will wait six weeks to get my money back . just wonderful

soft	we purchased this software to map retail locations on a region . it is missing too many features to be usable . for instance , when you import a custom graphic pushpin , the software does n't resize it as you zoom which forces you to create multiple sizes in another program . you can add text description boxes but have no control over the font or sizing -- and they do n't resize either . we highlighted our specific region but the software does n't let you print just that region ( called 'territory . ) we searched the help files and their word 'territory ' is not even listed . you can not save your map graphics in any standard graphics format , e.g . jpeg , pdf or ai . we tried printing to a pdf generator , but map point 's map output is of very poor resolution even on the highest settings . after wasting a lot of time , it 's apparent we should have tried google maps/earth with our graphics editing software for a solution that works
soft	maybe it 's because i was upgrading from an older version -- 2002 -- but i found the new features to be very good . for example ... the junk mail feature works better than any other i have used . it was catching junk from the very beginning , and has missed very few things . i have only had one thing put in the junk folder that was not junk email . also the security features are far superior to the 2002 version . and the calendar is more flexible and easier to use . installation was seemless . i think it might be a little overpriced , but considering how long i will keep it , it 's not too bad
soft	i have used mcafee antivirus for years and it is an excellent product . i bought the suite this time and found it will not allow you to run a different firewall ( zonealarm ) in my case . that is the only negative i have found so far . the mcafee firewall seems sufficient so far
soft	i have got a virus that cause files `` comment.htt '' appeared in many folders and my previous antivirus can detect them but can not destroy that virus . i tried to use another 2 antiviruses but not effective . so i try kav and it works ! also kav does not slow my computer like some big-named antivirus . autoupdate feature is cool . we do not have to click anything and the prize is reasonable
soft	works fine . like several other office packages lacks database program , access
soft	adobe has totally re-done the interface to streamline it and make it cleaner from versions prior to cs . if you are a quarkxpress user , you 'll find that in indesign cs2 , you get the feeling that it is laid out in a logical and easy-to-use manner . the tools and tool palettes are where you 'd expect them to be in the menu structure and on the screen . small touches like being able to save your workspace , like you can do in photoshop cs2 , are great . i tested the integration between indesign cs2 and some of its counterparts in the adobe creative suite premium . i created different graphics in photoshop cs2 and illustrator cs2 and i found it was really easy to import them into indesign cs2 and use . you can effects like drop shadows and feathering to images directly in indesign cs2 . no need to go to another program . with the control palette you can also resize objects too . this palette functions with transform and stroke features for graphics , and it includes paragraph , character and table features for text editing . what the palette does is affected by the type of selection you have made - either graphic or text . i imported some formatted text in from microsoft word 2003 and two different tables in from microsoft excel 2003 . i was concerned how the tables would appear after the import from microsoft excel . the tables imported easily . with indesign cs2 , you can now automatically style microsoft word files on import by mapping word styles to indesign cs2 styles as well . an issue for a long time has been how to preview or view other types of files that you want to incorporate with indesign cs2 . now , adobe `` bridges '' that gap . bridge now comes as a part of indesign cs2 and the premium suite . so , viewing any adobe-type formatted file or standard graphic format is easy to do . using the same interface between the different programs is a help as well . adobe bridge is a standalone program . being a web designer and using adobe ( formerly macromedia ) dreamweaver 8 , i was familiar with using snippets . these are portions of code you can save for use in other programs or you can export them to give to someone else . now , indesign cs2 offers this snippet capability . you can export objects as snippets . these objects can be shared or reused in other documents . simply place or drag a snippet into a layout , and indesign re-creates the original objects , their formatting , and their relative positioning on the page . no more wasted time redesigning , just to get something you have brought in from another document to fit . indesign cs2 also now has an info palette that is just like those found in photoshop and illustrator . size dimensions and resolution are immediately available by selecting the graphic and simply glancing over to the info palette . this is a crucial tool when fitting graphics in a specifically space-limited area . it 's important to know the actual dimensions with which you are working . sometimes in designing and re-designing printed work , you have to move objects . when this happens , your structure can often change in different ways . indesign cs2 helps you maintain your layout by allowing you to anchor your callouts , pull quotes , margin notes , and graphics to text . you can now precisely control the positioning of anchored objects , apply text wrap settings , and more . as with other adobe products , it is very easy to export your finished work in pdf format . indesign cs2 works so well at exporting to pdf , it even maintains the layers in acrobat 7 . you can pre-define your acrobat export settings as well . indesign cs2 also supports specialty pdf formats like pdf/x-1a and pdf/x-3 , which are used in workflows . it also supports high-resolution cmyk output and color-managed workflows . if you are familiar with previous versions of indesign , the upgrade to the new version is easy . indesign cs2 is even backwards compatible cs . you will find that your learning curve is greatly decreased . loren elks , group manager d-mag.or
soft	this software is easy to use . it 's like tax software , it ask questions , you answer . has everything i wanted it for and a lot more . i would recommend it.cheaper than a lawyer
soft	i have been using adobe acrobat for a few years now . i 've used both their professional and standard versions . now , adobe has released acrobat 7 . in this review , i will be discussing primarily the features of the standard edition . however , these features are also available in the professional edition . outside of the fact that the professional version has more workgroup-oriented and enterprise features , these programs are the basically same . i have noted any features available only in professional in this review . first , what is pdf and what can it do for me ? adobe 's pdf is now a universal format that allows you to preserve the look and integrity of your original documents - adobe pdf files look exactly like the original pages and fulfill requirements for electronic filing and document security . not only that , but you can share the files with anyone , whether on a pc or a mac . each pdf file has the graphics and fonts imbedded into the file . the user of the file does not have to have the same font set , nor even purchase adobe acrobat , because the reader version of acrobat is free ! new features in acrobat 7 * turn ms outlook email into searchable documents . this is a great feature . it allows you to effortlessly turn those old emails into the universal pdf format . acrobat 's searching capabilities make even searching through the longest emails easy and accurate . * attaching source files . previously , we have been able to create pdfs from spreadsheet and other formats . now , not only can you do that , but this new feature allows you to attach the documents with the pdf ! * improved browser . acrobat 's browser has been improved to make searching for documents easier . if you are familiar with the adobe photoshop browser , you 'll like the new upgraded browser in acrobat 7 . * searching improved . the search feature has been improved when you are looking for files . it is easier to search for files , because now adobe has made the feature more friendly . you can search by document and text properties on your local computer or across your companies lan or wan networked drives . more about acrobat although many people are familiar with the acrobat reader program , they are not as familiar with acrobat itself . i consult will many business persons and they are just astounded at what acrobat 7 can actually do for their business . just the fact that you can collect and assemble output from different types of programs into on universal format floors them every time ! another great point about assembling the documents in acrobat is the compression factor . with acrobat , users are able to compress the original documents , thus saving space and making it more efficient to transmit the documents via email or internet downloads . this new version can now also create , and save `` pdf/a '' files for archiving and it allows users to scan paper documents directly into a searchable pdf file saving space and time . many companies around the country are making the jump to the `` paperless '' environment . acrobat 7 can definitely help . in fact , i know of an attorney 's office making great use of acrobat . they have almost converted their entire office to a paperless organization by using acrobat because of its form creation , reviewing , commenting , approval and signature features . in paper document storage space alone , this office is saving thousands of dollars per year . even legal documents can be approved , digitally signed and verified in acrobat . anyone concerned about the security of their documents has nothing to fear . acrobat 's security features including the ability to create self-signed digital ids are terrific ; no matter if you have pdf documents loaded on your website for downloading to clients or if you are emailing the files . for professional users , adobe has added a new feature called e-envelopes . with the new e-envelopes , user can package their pdf files in an encrypted wrapper and send those files securely via email . for company networks , adobe has also added support for your company-wide security policies using a new feature called lifecycle policy service . the granularity of the security allows the user to pick exactly what they will allow the recipient of the file to do like printing , copying , pasting and so on . many people are also surprised that acrobat is n't just for static documents . users can create interactive forms ( professional only ) as well . in fact , i know a client who is an attorney . they have almost converted their entire office to a paperless organization by using acrobat because of its form creation , reviewing , commenting , approval and signature features . in paper document storage space alone , this office is saving thousands of dollars per year . for cad and graphics professionals who work with 3d files , acrobat 7 ( professional only ) can now convert these into pdf format for ease of viewing , whether in electronic or printed format . this will allow the users to quickly send their clients views of the 3d object in the universal pdf format without the purchase of additional software for the recipient of the file . another feature is the new licensing capability that adobe has added to acrobat 7 . you can install the program and activate it on two separate computers , which is great if you work at home and at the office as well . need to install it on a third computer ? not a problem . the transfer activation feature allows you to transfer the license to another computer . to do this , deactivate one copy and transfer the activation via a simple menu command . if your computers have internet access , the change happens right away . this feature alone may save users money on purchasing multiple copies of the software . summary i would highly recommend this product to anyone in business . the easy of use and versatility of adobe acrobat 7 make it an indispensable tool , whether you are a legal professional , an it company , accounting firm , healthcare company or anyone else in business . this is one investment where the roi will definitely outweigh the purchase price of the software within weeks of normal use . the ability to go paperless and save valuable office space that is now gobbled up by filing cabinets , paper binds and closets alone should make the difference for almost any company . testing setup to conduct tests of the software , the following hardware was used : pc compatible system ( 2 ghz athlon processor , 512 mb ram , 30 gb hd ) epson scanner/fax/printer hp laserjet 8150dn printer for software tests ( conversion to pdf format ) , the following software was used : ms office 2003 ( word , excel , outlook ) photoshop cs loren elks group manager , d-mag.or
soft	i have used turbo tax for about 20 years and have loved it . in the past it was user-friendly , efficient and complete - it even printed out all the forms i needed - ready to send to the irs . as usual , i purchased it this year . the format changed and is n't nearly as user friendly as in years past . you have to manually select the walk-through feature , section by section and it 's very easy to miss sections . when i got to the end , it would n't let me do a review for errors until i updated the version . but , i do n't have internet at home and could n't update . it crashed my computer 3 times before i skipped the review totally . ( god only knows what else i skipped in the process . ) when i went to print the forms - again it nagged me that the software was inferior and needed to be updated . again , i skipped it but the pages printed out with a nasty watermark saying the forms were n't updated and could n't be used . i ca n't use these . i ca n't send them to the irs . so , i have to find irs forms and manually insert the information myself . so , why did i spend money for the software ? ? why would they sell a product that you ca n't actually use ? yes , it 'll `` prepare '' my forms . but , what good is that if i ca n't print them out ? why would they sell a product that was already so obsolete that you ca n't use it without contacting the company for another version ? absolutely - run - do n't walk - run run run away from this product . do n't buy it because it simply does n't work . i wo n't use turbo tax again . they have lost a faithful and long time customer
soft	systemic mechanic 6 seemed to be helping , since it handled a lot of the advertised functions well . however , the `` repair broken shortcuts '' function does not work properly . for a variety of reasons i use a large number of microsoft word shortcuts in my folder/ file system . system mechanic `` repaired broken shortcuts '' on a large number of my short-cutted documents by directing the shortcut from the correct file target to the wrong file target . now i am pulling up documents which are similar ( but are actually older versions which i have save to an auxiliary hard drive ) or unrelated to the actual , correct target file . this has had severe productivity consequences , since i have to double check the target of every file opened via a shortcut . contacting on-line help was of no help whatsoever .
soft	heard other poster said v10 has been available , so searched and found it is true . v10 is available at the maker 's web site at the same price as that of v9 sold here . btw , i planed but have n't buy the product yet . but i have to assign a star number in order to post this message
soft	photoshop is incredibly awesome ! ! ! and in reality most professionals already know that fact and have no need to read further about the program , it is a must have for them . however the learning curve here is extremely steep . this program is designed for people that use it in their jobs daily to produce images for sale . there are less inexpensive and easier to use programs out there for people looking to edit images for personal use including photoshop elements .
soft	i really thought that office was better proir to the whole xp upgrade , but that i will leave to other discussions . this product is your standard microsoft office products . i am fairly sure that most have experienced their products . there are no surprises and the added bells and whistles are n't worth the upgrade unless your are a vba programmer . now , having gone through all of this , i do not rcommend that you purchase this product , but purchase the student version . same product - hugely different price .
soft	i 've been using studio for years and while i definitely had reliability problems with studio 10.0 , 10.6 has been very reliable , and beta testing 10.7 shows me it is just getting better . i tried premiere elements but it was much harder to figure out how to do things , and it was much slower burning a simple dvd image , and it simply does n't do hd which i 've started playing with . i 'm sticking with studio and i make a dvd just about every week with my kids ' videos . i do recommend that you have a good system that is fairly clean
soft	i had two new fully operational g5 computers with panther operating system already factory installed . i was contacted by apple that a new operating system was available , faster , yada yada yada . i took the two computers into the store and purchased the new operating system tiger . the software proceeded to completely destroy both hard drives on both computers . i returned them and told them i wanted my mony back . they refused since the software was oipened but agreed to replace the corrupted software and install it for free . the computers never worked right since . we were forced to continue working with these crippled computers as we have deadlines to meet . it was a nightmare as it took four times the normal time to do the work because of crashes etc . we were already out a week with down time due to their negligence . when the smoke cleared we took them back in and asked them to take the operating system tiger out and replace the computers with the original operating system . another four hours standing in line . we got them back to the office and low and behold they still did not work . we took them back again and were told by a snotty tech that we had dust in the computer as if that 's what the cause has been all along . he told us never to come in with dust in the computer again even though the dust was in areas that we are not allowed into without breaking the warranty . if this were the case why has n't it been a problem for the past 12 years ? and what am i supposed to do ? only use the computer in an operating room ? the dust he displayed was extremely minimal the computer was only six months old and if it were such a problem why did n't the other four techs working on the computers notice it and clean it the first four times they had it on their bench ? bottom line.. i 'm tired of buying new programs and computers that do n't work . tired of standing in line for hours . tired of companies not having a complaint line . how handy is that ? no wonder they keep saying your the first one that 's had a problem with this . that 's literally impossible since i work in the entertainment indusrty that deals with editing and service bureaus that operate 100s of computers . they all are avoiding tiger because of known problems as well . apple is not addressing this and hundreds if not thousands of businesses are losing valuble production time due to their negligence . instead of trying to develope a way for my daughter to dock her i-pod to a bowling ball , they should concentrate on making operating systems work in their computers . total time lost in our company is at least a week which is in dollars around 20,000.00 . i ca n't imagine how much is being lost nation wide . something needs to be done about this . they need to be held accountable for the destruction they cause by distributing faulty product.to add salt to the wound they keep coming up with all these stupid ideas on why the computers are not running right after they destroyed them initially . there comes a time that if they ca n't fix them , they need to replace them and stop wasting the consumers time and costing them money . we need a lemon law that applies to computers . then the manufacturers will make sure they function before they are sold . i know i ca n't get the money my business had lost back but i want them held accoutable for distribution of a faulty op and replace the computers they ca n't fix instead of sending me back to the office with inoperable computers
soft	between high school and college i have studied french for three years and i had been convinced that i would starve to death in paris trying to understand the menu and to then get myself understood . much of that has changed not that i am half way through the rosetta stone program . my ear is now tuned to the language . i have a visceral feeling for the grammar and an ability to discern tenses . my vocabulary still needs to get stronger , but now that i can distinguish individual words in a stream of french , that is only a matter of practice with the language . as advertised , this program is painless and progress is rapid . try the demo , you 'll see .
soft	i became interested in this after trying a more advanced program for my business . after weeding through too many option that did n't apply , i knew i just needed somthing simple -- a good way to monitor money in , money out . this program is simple and easy to adjust if you make a mistake . i highly recommend it , as it is exactly as described
soft	slowed a new system down too much when running in backgroud . went back to free verison
soft	cakewalk '' s advertisement saying something like ... '' no experience needed to operate this software ... '' is , in my mind , mis-leading at least and a down right lie at most . i 've had it now for about three weeks , work on it most days , usually in the middle of the night so i can really concentrate on it , and still cant get anything out of it . all i wanted was some backing tracks for my acoustic guitar work ... blues , pop , country ... .so far nothing and i am thinking about giving up . i can operate a computer but this skill has nothing to do with this most confusing piece of junk i have ever seen . beware ... unless your a recording engineer you probably will be disapointed .
soft	as another reviewer says : `` but the final tax forms i needed to file with were not included on the cd-rom package . turbotax instructed me to get them by using `` one-click update . '' well after i update and attempt to restart the software , turbotax refuses to come up at all . '' exactly . i 've re-installed it over and over and the same thing happens . i 've used turbotax in previous years and never had a problem like this . after spending hours entering in my data , there is apparently no way to get to the final filing stage . with four days before the due date , this is disasterous . their support site offers no hint of a fix . mac users , stay away
soft	i bought this product after reading the other on-line reviews saying how easy it was to use . i am someone who works with computers daily and this was anything but easy ! it was hard to understand and getting someone from their help desk to assist was a joke ! i would n't recommend this product to anyone unless you 're a professional architect/ computer genius
soft	i 've only just started . but so far , i am very pleased with this language program . my only regret is that i do n't have enough time to keep at it . the various learning modalities are quite useful-this is the only program ( aside from taking a class ) that i 've used which does this . i recommend it
soft	i think some of the reviewers here did not use the program more enough , am using it since version 2 till now as an illustrator this program ca n't be beated ... gradient fill was so stupid to create in earlier versions of adobe illustrator u must create two objects then blend them together to form a gradient fill then you have to mask it within a path or the shape you are filling , one more thing the mask in corel `` container '' is a wonderful tool to have much better than the mask used in illustrator that sucks ( u have to see me pulling out my hear if i made i mistake using it ) do you want more i have a lot to mention . am using both program everyday know them very well and to be honest i do all the artwork in coreldraw then i export to illustrator for color separation and printing and that becuase the printers agancies in my country do n't know how to use corel so i have to ride the wave and finalize thing in illustrator . i do all detailed drawings precisely using the guidelines and grid ( first in available in corel ) creating layouts , realistic objects or models with shadings and shadowing as well with ease this software is so powerfull if you are a real artist you must get i
soft	i bought two of the mia computer games for my emotionally disturbed special ed . class . i bought it specifically for one little guy who has been in crisis since his grandmother ( caregiver ) passed away . the storyline of the game is that mia has to save her gravely ill grandmother . then she gets mugged by a rat ! i feel this is a little to noir for small children . the math game ( which i am returning unopened ) is about her house burning down , and if she could prevent it by going back through time . i feel like this puts a whole world of responsibility on young subjects . i am returning both games
soft	i have not yet looked at all the documents included in this software . i appreciate the tutorial nature and the pro/con examples given . since i am not a lawyer , i am a bit nervous about making legal decisions that would need a test in court to be sure i made the correct choices . i did complete the healthcare directive and it compares well with others i 've seen used in my state . i need to learn more about estate planning and this is going to teach me the jargon and the proper questions to ask . my only complaint is that i declined the free delivery option and paid for delivery so i would have enough time to work with it before my parents appointment with their estate attorney . it did not arrive in a timely manner and i was forced to purchase a download version from another vendor in order to complete forms i wanted the attorney to look at . it is no surprize that he was more interested in drawing up his own forms for my parents and charging $ 1000 for a basic package . i decided to keep the cd anyway ( when it finally arrived ) just in case i have a hard drive failure .
soft	i agree with others who said it crashes the system . overall , i found ss6 pro had more problems than it was worth -- even if it were free , it 's not worth all the time and effort . besides all the crashes , downloading the virus/spyware updates via dialup takes forever ! each download runs 1 to 1 1/2 hours . be forewarned . in the end , i returned my copy to vcom , though to date i have not yet received a refund
soft	this product offers much to chose from and i really liked the photos . however , i have yet to get this program to work right . i am able to view the photos but when i go into the the export wizard to save the photos , the photo has a transparency over the top of it , instead of in the background . i tried bypassing the export wizard by right clicking on the selected photo and saving . this also inserts the transparency over the photo . i called hemera in canada and they instructed me to call encore usa in ca for support . encore usa said they could n't help me . encore 's technical support is `` limited to crashes , error messages and lockups '' . i also referred to their website hoping to find help in the knowledge base or faq 's . there was very little about this software and no help to be found . i wasted my money on a product i ca n't use and that offers no support for issues out of my control .
soft	this program does what it says . it does limit you to only 3 loadings of the product on your computer , so if you have more than 3 computers you have to buy another program
soft	i bought taxcut this year because it was inexpensive and included business tax forms for my partnership . for the money i guess i 'm satisfied with the partnership results , but that 's where it ends . taxcut for federal taxes is not integrated with taxcut for business ... ok so what do you want for cheap . but , it also is n't well integrated with the massachusetts state tax version , leaving me to go figure how to deal with what it calls `` special '' situations ( unreimbursed partner expenses and interest from out of state banks , for example ) . overriding form data is painful and the program complains that if i override calculated data i can not e-file ( not that i would trust it to e-file my taxes ) . form navigation is hopeless . i can only imagine what someone who is n't experienced with tax preparation could accomplish with this mess . i filed for an extension ; now i 'm probably going to buy turbotax to do the actual federal and state returns . with a deep discount , i would probably purchase taxcut again for the partnership taxes , because it is slightly easier to use than the excel spreadsheets i 'd been using ( but only because i do n't have to copy the numbers from the spreadsheets into the forms ) . honestly , you would think there would be some tax software that is better than the non-functional taxcut without the overblown , fatty and expensive too-many-talking-heads turbotax alternative
soft	i `` upgraded '' to norton 's 2006 version of internet security and virus protection software online . included was norton systemworks . i have used norton anti-viral software exclusively for several years without any major problems . and yes , i always remove my previous version , before adding new software . even though my internet connection is via private satellite antenna , it took almost two hours for the product to download and install . then when i rebooted my laptop ( a new high-end sony vaio with windows xp ) , it froze up during startup . i wo n't go into all the hassle involved , but after three removals and downloads over a period of several weeks , it became apparent that there was something seriously wrong with norton 's 2006 product . it caused crashes on almost a daily basis , and updates always took an excessive amount of time . customer service was no help at all , and the company refused to refund my purchase price . i 've since switched to a different brand of anti-viral internet protection software and have had no more problems with my computer . after this experience , i will never use norton products again . the only reason i gave this a 1-star rating is because it 's the lowest rating available . it should actually be minus 5 stars for the aggravation and time and money wasted
soft	i have spent the better part of 4 months dealing with these guys . they wo n't talk to you on the phone , do n't let you get support until you register your product with a serial # , which , if you lose and need to re-install , you ca n't get without a login and a serial # . that makes no sense . i 've had technical problems with true image home 9 and 10 , and just ca n't get them to resolve it . very unhappy with these guys . the product looks good , but if you have a glitch , prepare to wait a week or more for tech support to respond by email . check out their web site and try some numbers - you 'll find there 's no way to talk to anyone unless you want to buy something . this is not one experience with them . it 's feb 07 now , and this charade began last august ! buyer beware
soft	i 've owned this software since it 's ridiculously overpriced $ 500 1.0 inception . even at it 's latest 1.5.1 $ 299 version apple should still be ashamed of themselves . i use final cut studio and own 3 recent macs , so i 've been devoted to apple to say the least . i am a professional wedding photographer/videographer . i have been more than patient with this software . it looks great , up to apple 's standards in design and vision but remains absolutely plagued with bugs . and unless you pay apple laughable amounts of money ( much more than the cost of the software itself ! ) , they will not provide support on anything except installation ... even if there software update is the source of the issue . as someone who has been such an apple fan , i feel obligated to let everyone know that unless you enjoy pulling your hair out and repeating tasks over and over again do yourself a favor and download lightroom from adobe .
soft	i just purchased the hallmark card studio 2004 ( ... ) . everything installed fine but when attempting to print a card , the first side printed fine , but when printing the next side i keep getting the `` this program has performed an illegal operation and will shut down '' . i have been in contact with their technical support but have not had any luck so far . i have wasted a lot of paper and ink so far in getting just part of a card printed . i am running windows 98se . i will probably be returning this to the store ( if possible ) . it looked to have some nice cards on it , which is basically all i wanted it for , but for some reason will not print correctly on my computer .

soft	i was a private beta tester for the new os . i tested the software for a whole year and i am not pleased with it . if you depend on stability for your existing software , you are out of luck . the hardware and software support for the new operating system is horrible . many businesses will have to upgrade their hardware to use windows vista . you are better off upgrading to a mac . after all , microsoft did steal many ideas from apple computers .
soft	do n't take my word for it that 's a quote from the title of a recent post excoriating this irritating and increasingly bloated product on slashdot . be warned : adobe has not learned its lesson , and despite the outcry that followed the release of version 6 , this latest release of acrobat continues adobe 's aggressive trend of intruding into your desktop environment , again , as in version 6 without providing an easy way to undo the damage once its done -- in fact , it 's now nearly impossible . like earlier releases , this version of acrobat adds startup macros and new toolbar buttons to your existing applications and adds menu entries to your desktop `` right click '' menus . adobe argues that these are conveniences , but they are entirely unnecessary ( for most of us `` printing '' to adobe pdf achieves the same result , is much more convenient , and a more natural model ) , and clutter what for most users is either a too-crowded user interface ( for those who do n't have the knowledge or patience to customize it ) or a carefully tuned one ( for those who do ) . unlike many well-behaved applications that provide obvious ways of avoiding this kind of intrusive and disruptive behavior ( e.g . through a simple checkbox option in a settings dialog ) , acrobat 's `` option '' for disabling this behavior , once deeply hidden in the setup process , is now almost completely absent . to disable the `` convert to adobe pdf '' button that mysteriously appears in the outlook mail editor , for example , one has to be sure to choose `` this feature will not be available '' from the `` microsoft outlook '' option under `` acrobat pdfmaker '' under `` create adobe pdf '' . simply deleting the button using outlook 's toolbar customization feature will not work : it comes right back when the editor is next opened . similar problems arise in word , excel , visio , project , and internet explorer . and there 's simply no way to get rid of the never-used `` convert to adobe pdf '' and `` combine in acrobat ... '' entries in that appear in the desktop context menus for files ( even if one installs none of the acrobat pdfmaker features ) . for the technically inclined wishing to repair some of the damage that acrobat 7 does , there are complex but largely effective step by step instructions available on the web , but even the authors of these are driven to despair by version 7 : ( `` adobe has really pushed the boat out with acrobat 7 and managed to screw word royally '' ) . in short , acrobat will make a mess of your working environment , there 's no way to completely fix it , and even the partial fix is a pain ( and not well documented ) . ( this may seem a minor issue , but if every application followed adobe 's reckless example , our working environments would start to look like strip malls , crowded with features screaming for our attention to the point where it is hard to find what we need when we need it . one of the great strengths of the personal computer desktop is that users can configure it in ways that suit their needs ; no application should interfere with that . ) experienced acrobat users will also notice that this version continues another frustrating trend for acrobat ( and most other adobe applications ) : it is yet again slower to launch than the previous version . in fact , on my 2 ghz pentium 4 , it takes longer to launch than the entire visual studio .net development environment , and longer than the boot sequence for windows xp ! there are other minor problems as well ( arbitrary rearrangements of menu and tool bar items , etc . ) but these two major flaws are more than bad enough . unless you really need the latest acrobat features , you should probably avoid this upgrade . and if the `` improvements '' in this release are any indication of where adobe plans to go with future releases , it may be time to start looking elsewhere for a tool for digital document management . fortunately , there 's no reason at all to upgrade . version 7 offers no usefully new features , so you can ( and should ) avoid this one ( at all costs )
soft	i have been using this product now for almost a year . the only reason i insist using it is because i feel really bad for wasting my money . first , this is not worth $ 300 bucks . there are only still pictures and sound . no movies or any fancy graphics , so why the price ? second it is very repetitive and it does not advance in a very logical way so that you recognize the grammatical structures behind the ever changing sentences . third , the sentences that you have to repeat over and over are not practical at all . you keep memorizing thins like `` the boy is under the airplane '' or `` the ball is on the boy 's head '' . initially i thought , well this is because it progresses very slowly which is not necessarily bad . but then i took a look at the last lessons ; you just keep repeating useless senteces like these without real things used on a dialogue . i can not recommend you another course because i spent so much in this one that i do not want to try again and get disappointed . do n't be fooled by the wonderful reviews like i was . this is definitively not worth 300 dollars . it is not even useful for basic converstion . i have learned much more from simple travel books and cassettes from the library . ah , and if you think that by repeating these structures alone you will understand german grammar ..
soft	i like wordperfect much better than microsoft word as it is easier to use . reviel codes solves a lot of problems when text wont behave . not available in word . i bought the x3 version because of some bad bugs in ver 12. , like not being able to export my address book without errors and mail merge problems . the price was right on amazon and it was easier that trying to fix 12 . i do n't see a big difference between the two versions except that they fixed all the problems that i was having in 12 . if an earlier version is working for you , i see no good reason to upgrade . b
soft	this version does not have voice prompts to tell you directions or some of the other features you might expect . microsoft now provides voice messages in version 2006 and it is cheaper than this version ( $ 59-79 depending upon timing ) . it is worth the price if you have a laptop . pocket streets is disappointing . by the way , it is illegal to have your laptop open in the front seat in some states so do n't get a ticket ( they allow a normal gps but not a laptop serving as a gps ... go figure ) . by the way , microsoft does not give a discount to upgrade from version 2005 to 2006 so your only choice is to purchase a new product at full price
soft	i tried to use this program to file a very simple return , and it calculated that i owed the state $ 550 for underpayment , as well as a $ 230 penalty for late payment . i tried working through the program several times to find the error . i found that the program was automatically checking boxes that i had n't checked ! i have no idea if that was the cause of the underpayment problem , which i was not able to resolve . in frustration , i went to [ ... ] and filed my return easily within an hour , with a $ 140 return from the state rather than a $ 780 penalty
soft	i tried to like this product . as previous reviews have said it has significant design limitations . if you only need a 2d floorplan there are better tools for the same money or less . the object libraries that come with the tool - furniture , fabrics , etc . - are really lame . this limits it 's value as an interior design tool . i did not attempt to return it so i can not comment on their return policy
soft	this is the most technically excellent racing sim i have played . the physics are perfect , the graphics are pleasing , and there is a wide variety of tracks and cars . the learning curve can be very steep , but you can adjust the ai to suit your needs . you can also turn on traction control , steering aids , etc. , which will get you into the game faster . after a couple months , you 'll be good enough to turn these aids off and drive the cars the way they are meant to be driven . there is also a comprehensive driving school which will train you in the basics of racing . if you want a realistic racer , buy this game
soft	turbotax is okay if you only have a 1040a to file , but anything beyond that it quickly becomes a real pain in the nether region . not only that , but if you have complications with trying to file , good luck . it looks as though i will have to pay to have my estate taxes filed . ttax is worthless
soft	i am very disappointed with this product . using the features of it are very difficult ( red eye , sizing , etc . ) in addition , digital photos downloaded into photo album 6 are of poor quality/clarity on the computer screen . i expected more from it but have found i have less . i will not buy an upgrade but rather will look for another product with similar and more easy use features
soft	in my experience really learning a language requires a mix of learning approaches . that means books , tapes , tutoring , and experience in a country that uses it . i have done all of these and feel this product is well worth including in the mix . i highly reccomend it . if you 're serious you need to just pony up the money and use it .
soft	this is a great program for using a bible on your palm . the only issue was that i had to return the first cd for scratches and the 2nd was also all scratched up . it worked but ... .
soft	excellent product works as advertised and so simple to use . product well packaged , arrived earlier than expected and in mint condition . scansoft responded with an email in a timely fashion acknowledging receipt of my rebate paperwork and provided a pin number for me to access their site to check on it 's progress . but you know rebates ... .they take forever ! pdf converter 4 is not my only scansoft product . i also use paperport 10 and am extremely satisfied with that . my buying experience has always been positive with amazon.com vendors , never a problem . john mc laughlin daytona beach , florid
soft	some existing programs , such as norton system works , are not compatible with vista and norton insists that you pay for an upgrade to the 2007 version . other than the compatibility issue , windows vista home basic works fine for me . larry leika
soft	unlike versions up to no . 6 , this version require authorization . this means that a single use version ca n't be loaded on multiple computers . adobe informed me that this was not a bug and wanted me to buy multiple copies eventhough i am only using one computer at a time . this version forces you to take off the old legal version in order to install . when i found out that my legal version could n't be used , it forced me to reinstall version 6 , this took almost an hour to install , reboot , un-install and reinstall the orginal version . why is adobe the only company that forces this ? their program installation do n't even skip from one set of four numbers to the next . they force you to type the dashes between the numbers . if you have multiple computers stay away from anything above version 6
soft	i have been taking acustic guitar lessons for 6 years now . i decided to buy this to try and learn to play the electric guitar i recieved as a gift . it 's a pretty good method . sometimes a bit difficult to work with , but you do learn some things . i stopped using it because it became increasingly difficult to play when i realized that i had a bass amp . so make sure you have all the right equipment , and i would have to say that this might be easier for someone who 's taken guitar lessons .
soft	i guess i 'm spoiled by the i spy games i 've purchased for my children . this game has an enormous amount of `` story '' ... it 's almost as bad as sitting your child in front of the television . interaction is confusing and frustrating . i 'd rate this lower but it 's clear that a lot of work went into the animation , which is top notch . i just would n't classify this as a learning game .
soft	taxcut is easy to use but the explanations are not complete , nor written in a way that is easy for laypersons to understand . many terms of art are not defined at all . most disturbingly , when you first sign up for the product the price is listed at $ 54.95 for both state and federal filing , but after you have already done all the work and are ready to file , the only options listed at checkout time are $ 29.95 for federal and another $ 29.95 charge for the state filing . this bait-and-switch is apparently widespread and common for h block , unfortunately . i called and complained to customer service and they refunded me $ 5 . i told them that i thought it was certainly unethical and probably illegal , and they were inviting a lawsuit with this deceptive practice . finally , the program crashed several times while i was using it . although the data was always saved , it was quite obnoxious . i run a high-performance , well-maintained mac powerbook , so i 'm not accustomed to having things run so poorly . next year i 'll go with turbotax .
soft	it was an excellent purchase . fast ans efficient receipt of goods and fine quality
soft	normally i might wait to install a new software upgrade , but i just got a new laptop and thought it would be best to use office 2007 with the new vista operating system . i was wrong . you would expect that a multi-billion dollar company like microsoft could put out a powerful and bug-free piece of software . but after a month of using office 2007 , you get the distinct impression that this software is not ready for public release . microsoft should be ashamed . i do n't know the root cause of my problems , but i have to stress that i am running a clean install of office 2007 on vista , so there should n't be any software conflicts or issues . so what are my issues ? the list is long : -- my biggest concern is that ms word constantly hangs and stalls . it can making editing a document very painful . i suspect the problem is when i put images or visio diagrams into a document . but that is something the old ms word was able to do without an issue . oddly , if i have a colleague open the document and save it out in word 2003 , the problem goes away ! what ? ! it 's killing my productivity . -- when ever i cut and paste from an old document , word hangs for 15 to 20 seconds . and often the formatting and margins in my new document go haywire . i keep having to spend a ton of time fixing things . this never happened in the old word . this is another time killer . -- every few days , outlook 2007 starts telling me that it can not display my email folders . uh oh ! i have to completely restart my computer to see my email again . -- outlook 2007 breaks many graphic emails that people send -- they look like a mess . it is because outlook 2007 does not render html correctly since it uses the word engine , not internet explorer to display email . i have no idea why microsoft did this , but they have got to fix it . -- many of the issues in the old word 2003 still have n't been fixed . if you place an image , it can often be hard to get it to appear correctly . why ca n't they solve this one ? -- while most office programs have the new ribbon interface ( which i like ) , some programs like visio 2007 do not . so you have to remember how to use two interfaces . could n't microsoft find the time and money to update all its programs ? give me a break . -- on a few occassions in visio 2007 , my files have failed to save correctly . at first i thought this must have been my fault , but it 's happened to me a few times and ca n't be a coincidence . a few times i 've gotten an error message and lost my work . ug . -- word and excel 2007 use a completely new file format . so anyone you send a document to has to have 2007 installed ( which is n't likely the case ) . to get around this , you can save it down to a 2003 file format , but then you end up with two files on your hard drive -- one in the new format and one in the old format . what a pain ! also , there definitely seems to be an issue with office 2007 opening older office 2003 files . could be the cause of many of my problems , but there is no way i can avoid using old files . they should have worked harder on compatibility . there are good things about the new 2007 . i do like the new interface design and the new features in outlook 2007 are amazing for organizing tasks and sharing your calendar . but i do n't think it 's fair that microsoft released a product so full of serious , serious bugs that have cost me hours and hours of extra work . i did n't spend hundreds of dollars on a beta product and do n't think the public should have to suffer . surely they can afford to do better !
soft	i have tried a few other photo editing products but i always come back to adobe . easy to use and excellent results
soft	this software might be recommended if better utilities were n't out there . this one gives the user a sense of security , but when my system crashed , fix-it could n't . i dutifully put in the rescue disk , booted up on it , restored my earlier system , exited and rebooted . nothing . before i 'd been able to get into safe mode , but now nothing . so when i manually restored my system , guess which program got yanked ? and it freed up a lot of system resources , too . ( had i known how much before , that alone would have soured me . ) my system now runs faster and does n't lag while typing . another small criticism : even though fix-it has automatic update for virus scans , i found more often than not i had to go to the vcom site and manually download the anti-virus files . no reason was ever given ; i 'd just get a message telling me to do it . very inconvenient . also warning*warning : this program has strict activation . you can only have it on one computer , so forget putting it on your notebook computer . finally , be careful when cleaning your registry . look at every entry this suite wants to delete . if you run it on default , it may remove critical registry keys and settings . in fact , i 'd use a different registry cleaner or some of the free ones . fix-it has some great features , but not enough to make it worth the system resources and a system sluggish system . ( not to mention the anti-virus problem ) . try system mechanic instead .
soft	it is great to be able to read all the avenger comics again . i read them as a kid , but did n't get to read the very beginning . i hope that they bring out more of the comic book characters on dvd . i will buy more
soft	i have used this anti-virus since 2000 , i liked it then , and i love it now . if your the type of user that does not want to worry about your computer on the internet , this is for you . it can be a pain on older computers that have less ram , but it still gets the job done . now the cons , i had 3 experiences with customer service , and 2 were postitive , and 1 was negative . i 'm not throwing the baby out with the bath water , although i wanted too . the woman was extremely rude , to the point that i contacted the corporate office . in the end i did renew my subscription . i had no idea how easy it is for exe programs , and the such to change settings on your computer allowing attacks . this software lets you know when your settings have changed as soon as they get changed . for 20.00 how can you go wrong !
soft	though it may lack some of the integrated tools of quicken or other financial software , ms money continues to be the best entry level software of its genre and the best value for the money . particularly notable is the ease of integrating it with your on-line banking tools to create a one stop shop for your financial needs
soft	i 'm just learning , and this bible is wonderful . it 's written in language i can understand ( much easier than the king james version ) , and the commentary brings everything into focus . there is so much extra information in this book and the commenters really took care to try to explain so a newbie like me could understand . the book comes with a concordence also , which is a god-send ( sorry about the pun ) . i 've been so engrossed in reading that i have n't even looked at the cd-rom yet , but i 'm sure it will have great information also . if you want an easy-to-read bible that comes with fantastic study material , this is the right book for you
soft	after using 7.0 for a few weeks i find that this is the best yet . the speed of opening attachments and the compression when making them is fabulous . i highly recommend anyone to upgrade to 7.0
soft	i bought this niv study bible and really enjoy the options it provides : daily memorization . morning and evening meditation and many different ways to `` read the whole bible in a year ... read `` ot nt ps and pr . in a year '' . n.t . in six months '' . `` daily light on a daily path '' . etc . there are many ways to approach your daily study . easy to navigate and can even highlight in colors . i would recommend this for anyone who wants to take the bible with them on the road or to work or wherever you take your palm pilot .
sports	have n't had for long but it seems to be a nice deal for the money . it does a lot of exercises . and seems easy to convert between types
sports	first off , let me start by saying that i really like my summit watch . it is large ( some may go so far to call it huge ) but it is surprisingly lightweight on my wrist , and quite comfortable to wear . those with bad eyesight will still be able to see the easy-to-read digital readout of the time , barometric pressure , altitude and compass . the numbers are quite big , so they are difficult to miss . the altitude reading measures in increments of +/- 1 foot , which is about as good as you can get . i like that . but what i really like about the highgear watches that i have n't seen in other brands which offer similar features , is the visual image on the face of the watch telling you what the weather conditions are or will be . no kidding , this watch will actually show you whether or not it is sunny , partly cloudy , or raining . pretty dang nifty if you ask me . the barometric pressure reading is only a small part of predicting the weather , however after months of use , i have to say that my little watch is way more accurate than my local tv weatherman . i 'd say somewhere around 75 % of the time what my watch says is exactly what the conditions actually are . not bad . it 's a feature i would very much like to have on my suunto and casio models with similar functions . until then , i 'll rely on my trusty ( and much cheaper ) highgear summit . if you are considering making the purchase of a wrist watch that offers the digital compass , altitude and barometer functions , before making that specific buy , do some homework and wherever possible , seek out a store where you can actually see the watches in person . being able to guess the size of a particular model using a picture on the computer can possibly mess up your purchase . find the best price , and pull the model out and actually try it on before you buy . for me , the highgear summit was a good purchase -- however if you would rather enjoy these same functions but in a smaller package , try the highgear axis , or possibly the more stylish but much more compact ( and way more expensive ) suunto observer . either way , doing a little homework will pay off in the end . happy hiking and i hope this helps you in your efforts to buy the right product . good luck
sports	it is a very good product . works extremely well when you using it while exercising . really makes you drip of sweat from your waist area
sports	great way to get rid of stress in the office . suction cup bottom works extremely well .
sports	i had gotten my wife a new bike and needed to find a helmet for her above-average sized cranium . the bell triton was it . it fit perfectly the first time she put it on and adjusted it . i would recommend it for anyone with a good-sized head on their shoulders
sports	let me just start this review out by making it clear that i am a huge basketball/nba/wnba/cba fan . i picked up this basketball and started dribbling it . i was amazed at two things . first of all , it bounces really high and you very rarely have to keep pumping it up like you do with some other basketballs . you can use it both outside/indoors although it is geared for more indoors then outdoors . second of all , the grip of the basketball is very good , so it wo n't slip out of your hands . this has been the only basketball that i have actually owned that does n't slip out of my hands . to wrap things up , i will end my review by making it clear that you should go with spalding and buy this basketball
sports	i really like this bike . it 's great . the only complaint i have is with amazon.com customer service . the bike came partly assembled . you really should tell customers exactly what they will have to assemble . i put the seat and pedals on . the `` quick release '' for the front tire was missing from the box . i called customer service and they could not send me one . she said i would have to send the bike back and get a new one . she could n't even give me the number of the mfg . i was so mad . i did n't want to send the bike back that was too much trouble . i took it to a bike dealer and he put the front wheel on .
sports	i guess you get what you pay for . this pedometer was difficult to calibrate , and continued to miscount steps , and therefore distance , covered . it is made of plastic , and came unclipped easily . i am a big person , and have started walking to improve my health . this product does not work for me , although it might be a different story for a slim person . it has been relegated to the junk drawer , and probably will eventually be thrown away . i 'll have to find another that works better and purchase it
sports	here 's the deal with this item : it 's fine for little girls ( and i suppose , little boys that are inclined to dance ) who have n't been exposed to a better dance game . i got this for christmas for my 5 year old daughter ; she takes dance , likes dancing , has never had or known about another 'dance dance revolution ' game , and she loves it . it 's a big hit ; she 's jumping all over the place , adds up her score at the end of each song , and it 's been a great , cheap gift , with exercise to boot . no , it 's not sophisticated . older kids or teens ( not to mention adults ) would grimace in pain over the ancient graphics and lousy sound . for them , get one that goes in their playstation or whatever . however , many 5 year old girls do n't have a playstation , or need one . this is perfect for them . for $ [ ... ] and shipping , it worked out great for a little kid . for a teen , it 's $ [ ... ] wasted . that 's the difference
sports	quick shipping/ but poor packaging . there was obvious chips of metal from the structure in the packaging and one of the main screw and bolts pagackages were already open ( lucky i found all ) bad packaging but excellent bench . it takes a decent bit of assembly but it fit perfect in my 2 car garage and still lets 1 car in . great multi-function product . you can do all core lifts and also do lats and curls to build the minor muscles for definition . pretty sturdy structure but seems a tad bit hallow ( no problems yet ) for a hundred fifty five bucks with free shipping ( another 155 value ) it was really worth it . i say to anyone who likes it , its worth it . just get it . wether your a pro or beginnger its good for getting stronger and adding mass
sports	need i say more ? the ball flew off with the plastic connector and wound up in the neighbor 's yard . thankfully no one was hurt
sports	i 've had trouble over the years finding ear plugs that would make a consistent seal against sound . i 've tried various types , including the compressible foam , but nothing seems to work all the time . i use ear plugs when riding my motorcycle , under my full face helmet . these plugs work great and are very comfortable . they 're also very easy to remove ( not so the compressed foam , if they 're just a little too far in ) . i 've had no problems with the ends touching the inside of the helmet and have since bought several more , including some for my riding buddies to try . my only complaint is that the included case does n't hold up to repeated use - the `` hinge '' just does n't last - but the plugs have held up nicely for a couple of months now .
sports	seems to be a good bike . have n't had time to ride it much yet .
sports	i figured i 'd give these a shot , since i 've heard good things about them . first off , though , to put these tees in the ground , you have to guide them with a finger ; otherwise , they 'll bend . the control and distance differences for me seemed negligable compared to traditional wooden tees . also , because of the sharp edges , there are now some nice grooves on the sole of my new 905r . i would n't recommend these tees if you have an expensive club you do n't want dinged up , unless those extra five yards really mean that much . if you have a slower swing speed than i do , though , ( mine 's about 105-110mph ) the grooves might not be an issue . the only reason that i gave these even two stars is because they last forever . when i was trying them out , i was playing 18 holes , minus the par 3 's , without breaking a single tee . overall , though , they are n't really suited for me as is
sports	this is the second vector i have purchased . my first six year old one has gotten beat up and the compass no longer works . the watch has a large dial and is a little bulky , but you get used to it . you trade that for a large easy to read dial . the watch has more features than you can use and a large instruction manual to go with it . it has the compass , barometer , temperature , and altimeter . the 6 hour barametric pressure history box is nice to warn you of incoming bad weather . the watch is a nice instrument , but i would warn against abusing it . it is shock resistant , not shock proof
sports	i have used the leatherman micra for years , and thought it was time for a change . the squirt is more money , but very handy , especially now because you do n't have to open the scissors to get at the tools
sports	i am very satisfied with the apex chair . i used one many years ago in a gym . i looked on line and found it on amazon.com . apex instructions were very easy to follow . this peace of equipment is very well constructed and is very good for your lower back and abs
sports	got my bowflex weeks ago and having trouble , lots of trouble putting it together . it 's not the product 's fault other than the fact that putting together is a real 'mutha . seems the parts could 've been marked better . identification is pretty much visual . instead , you have a `` picture map '' to compare what part is needed . i was doing fine until i inserted the wrong bolt , stripped the bolt trying to get it out , got the wd40 on it , finally had to use a crescent wrench . so , my confidence is blown and then i continued on to assemble the seat backwards . the assemblage directions could be better , believe me . i used the 800 # once , but i finally found that no matter what was suggested , the picture was misleading and there 's no way that could 've been explained . onward through the fog !
sports	i hate to complain too much since this is a pretty cheap item , but just to warn others - i bought this because i wanted an ab bench . it really does n't suit that purpose too well since it was one incline position only for abs - the other positions are just back support for working with dumbells . the ab position is pretty weak and does n't really work your abs as well as an abs only bench would have , plus it is a bit uncomfortable and as the other reviewer said , if you are anywhere near 6 ft tall or over , get something else . combined with shipping - this is a waste of almost 100 bucks here - while usable , it really wo n't make an impact on your workouts . i did a few sets of situps and really do n't feel the tightness i would have if i used a real bench or even just sat on the floor for that matter . if you 're on a budget , this may work if you put something under the front base to put it on a greater incline and/or do situps holding weights - and make sure you pad it with a blanket or something - the position is just too awkard . the fact that it 's a multipurpose bench takes away from it as an effective ab bench - real ab benches are one smooth incline , not a perpendicular seat that bends down halfway which really stretches your back a bit too much in a direction it 's not supposed to bend lol
sports	i used one powerglove for a month and it was sporadic at working and then quit entirely . amazon sent a free replacement . it did the same thing . i could n't get it to turn on , then after 8 minutes or so if it did turn on i could n't get it to turn off . it needs major redesigning . i like the concept and it was comfortable but that 's about all . barbara baxte
sports	this was the first toy my son picked up and put in his mouth at 3 months . i think he liked it because it is very light and easy to grab on to . he has found it so entertaining , and i especially appreciated that in his first months when there was n't a lot i could do with him . now i try to include it with all of my baby shower gifts !
sports	this monster is great ... my old millionaire nan came over recently to tell us that she was about to take us out of her will because we had too much money already , and as luck would have it she had to use the bathroom during that same visit . we heard this scream from the bathroom and when we broke in we found our nan dead on the floor ... luckily she had n't gone to her attorney 's office to sign the new will and we got our share after all ... thanks toilet monster..you were worth the $ 15 + $ 5 shipping we paid for you
sports	overall the item works well . if keeping track of one player it is just fine . when trying to play two players it is hard to get from one player to the second player . to play two players it has to go through all four players before getting back to the first player and then to keep strokes as they happen it is difficult to go back from player one and player two
sports	i just love this workout , it really gets you sweating . it 's a great workout for beginners as well , not too fast or complicated . i just started working out with the firm system , and plan to use it to get back into shape . you can always purchase more dvd 's to keep you motivated . i recommend this product to anyone who want to get into or stay in shape .
sports	this is the same toy i was given as a shower gift except mine has a rubber duck in the middle . the women who gave it to me said she got it a a dollar store . awesome toy for infants since it 's light , easy to grip , and easy to bit . my son loved this toy for 2-3 months until he was old enough to move on to bigger heavier toys
sports	they look nice , but they 're badly put together ; i had to re-sew all of the fingers within the first month
sports	nothing against these particular paddles , but avoid cheap paddles . if you splurge on any item in your kayak budget it should be the paddles . if you paddle , you will develop a close relationship with your paddles - it can either be a good one or a bad one . you can markedly improve your paddling experience with a relatively small increase in spending . good paddles will make you want to use your kayak
sports	just like once in a while even a blind squirrel finds a chestnut ... ..once in a while amazon gets it right ! had a very bad experience before christmas when ordering a gift for my daughter . after being scared into spending extra on next day shipping 2 weeks prior to christmas ... .on an `` in stock '' item , 5 days prior to christmas , i was notified that item was out of stock and i would n't receive it ... panic mode ! i sent an unsolicited e-mail complaint to amazon . my response was pretty much sorry , but amazon has no control over items that they essentially broker , and do n't actually inventory ... ..what ! i noticed that they did n't ask for a review of my experience on that one ! ! but my son did get his b-ball this time ... .and if it was n't for him , i would have never done business with amazon again ! this review probably does n't meet the guidelines and undoubtedly wo n't be posted
sports	i am in the same boat ... stupid..i should have read the comments before bidding on ebay and getting ripped off first on price..i paid about $ 45 on ebay ... and then it came stright from amazon and no dvd ... i called cust service and all they could tell me is to send it back and get a refund ... what a pain ... i told them to use photo shop and crop out the picture of the dvd ... false advertising ... oh well live and learn ... ball does seem pretty small once i aired it up ... i think i will look else where for a differnt name brand ball . and yes it takes like 30 min of pumping to get it blowed up and its a huge work out..arms hurt etc
sports	my daughter loves this toy . it 's brightly colored and she loves the honking legs . the tail part is only about six inches long so unlike the previous poster i really do n't see how a child could strangle themselves with it .
sports	the gloves we got do not get warmer with use of the batter
sports	i was really impressed with this nascar sleeping bag . i purchased it for my nephew who recently turned 5 . he 's a big nascar fan and he was super thrilled to have this .
sports	this inflatable kayak is functional and easy to transport given it 's light wheight . once inflated , it 's easy to carry with just one arm when empty . it also has a very sturdy feel once it 's completely inflated ( i would recommend an electric pump that you can plug into your car battery charger ) . with both seats in the kayak , there is suffient room and storage space for two adults and gear . i have been using this kayak mostly for fishing with my four-year-old son on small lakes . we generally carry two fishing rods , gear box , bottled water , and other related items , along with a dry bag . even with all this `` stuff '' in the boat there is plenty of room inside , and with the seats in place i have plenty of support and elbow room for paddling . i have n't yet taken this kayak on down a creek or river so i 'm not able to comment on its use in that scenario
sports	yea man soon as i got this basketball in my hands i had to play basketball right away nice grip and it came realy quick less then 4 days great b-bal
sports	purchased three of these at christmas . horns and lights did not work on but one , another was missing keys when delivered , luckily interchangable . within 5 days , one four wheeler had a faulty throttle and quit , the drive train fell out of the other with bolts going everywhere , and the third had two bald tires which burst ! all this before the new year turned . i contacted the company , and they offered assistance by sending a box of parts in the mail . however , they offered no assistance on actual repair , telling me that `` any man can do it with a few tools '' . after several hours and a visit to the tire shop , i fixed the bikes and they seem to work fine for now . i obviously question the quality of the product and be aware return shipping is not an option b/c these bikes are heavy and it would be cost prohibitive . i would buy at a store where i could take back if needed . good luck .
sports	this gun did n't work from the moment my son took it out of the box . the return shipment and restocking fee would have cost nearly the purchase price so i did n't bother . it went straight to the trash can
sports	the plastic side mounts ( 4 ) appear to be solid and not flimsy . i replaced the 12 supplied screws with actual stainless steel ones , ( you know , since this is going on a boat ! ) but at least the hooks to attach the cooler are stainless . the package says `` includes all stainless mounting fasteners '' so i guess that means hooks only . the supplied screws are not even galvanized . so if you plan to affix these mounts permanently to a boat , go get stainless screws that are also 1/2 '' longer than the ones provided . all in all it 's a nice kit but a little pricey for what you get
sports	do n't order this item or anything from mercantilla inc . the product was a different color than advertised , it was missing three important parts , without which you ca n't use the bench , and many of the other parts were damaged . i 've never had this many problems from any of amazon 's sellers . this was supposed to be my holiday present , but it turned out to be a real disappointment .
sports	i bought this gun thinking it looked like a cool and fun gun . i go through 1 freakin war with it and the thing wont cock any more and pieces are falling off it . i know how to treat guns but this is ridiculous , and for the record im not a kid im just to lazy to sign up
sports	this was the 2nd dvd with problems that i bought from this vendor . the first dvd had 2 sections where the dvd would pause but would continue playing , and i was willing to live with it . bootcamp/muscle endurance , on the other hand , would not play the muscle endurance workout at all ! i contacted the vendor and they said it was a problem with my dvd player and they would only allow me to exchange with any of their 'open ' dvds only to 'better suite my needs ' . i own 20+ workout dvds and none of them gave me any problems like this one did . the dvd is also fairly pricey and so i 'm afraid to buy any more of these dvds from them . i was able to play the bootcamp workout until towards the end ( before the cool down section ) where it would not continue playing . i like cathe 's workout very much . the part of bootcamp that i was able to play was excellent ! but i am very disappointed with this vendor
sports	the cold steel spike tanto is a lot of knife for a reasonable price . it is viciously sharp and will remove arm hair quite easily . it has a width across the spine of the blade that is unmatched by any knife its size i have ever seen . virtually indestructible . the case is excellent if plain . this knife leaves very wide wounds in steak ; i think stitches would be the only way to close the wounds . on the down side it does n't hold an edge very long and its handle is very short and i wear a medium glove . overall this is a knife built for the sole purpose of self defense . it is small to make it easily concealable and comes with its own neck chain . it is a knife that wo n't let you down when the going gets tough , used in its intended purpose it should be virtually indestructible and wickedly efficient .
sports	it 's not that bad of a product , considering how cheap it is . however i have three definite criticisms . one , it is n't very stable . when your doing dips , it 's pretty wobbly . two , the pull-up bar is n't far enough away from the crossbars , so if your body swings at all during your pull-ups , it 's really easy to bash your shins on the lower crossbar . and three , the push up bars are totally usless . you can not do push ups on them with out hitting your head on the lower cross bar .
sports	this knife 's single blade , a bottle opener , nail file , and two flat-head screwdrivers ( one large , one small ) come packed in a slimline aluminum case . there 's a can opener , too -- though i 've never tried to use it -- and a panel on one side that can be engraved . it 's an elegant package and lightweight . once you 're used to this little buddy , you wo n't want to carry the standard red plastic version . the only caveat : do n't take this to the airport . it will be confiscated . note : to avoid losing it , you can attach a cord or thin chain to the small ring at the end . with this , a woman can attach her knife to her purse , and will be automatically reminded to return it when the task is done . a man can attach the chain to a belt loop . until i did this , i had several `` walk '' after lending them to someone who needed a knife `` just for a minute . ''
sports	i just ordered a pair of these for my son , since my daughter is so pleased with them . the wheel base is wide enough that beginners can get their balance quickly . the wheels roll very smoothly . the velcro attachment at the top provides ankle support , and is easier to adjust than just laces . a fun outdoor activity ! laurie , mother of emma ( 8 ) and kevin ( 11
sports	i just got my poles , and while they seem great in other ways , they do not offer the soft antishock system as the description says they do
sports	i purchased this matt to protect my laminate flooring from the weight of my heavy elliptical exercise machine . unfortunetly , the matt is not thick and compresses to paper thin under the weight of the elliptical . i would not recommend this to anyone with anything more than very light exercise equipment
sports	initially i had some trouble figuring out the right port to use . but now it works and i 've used it constantly for at least 2 years
sports	i have to say that i love this mat . the combo jute and rubber make it nearly impossible to slip . only thing is ... the jute and rubber are rubbing up against one another and kind of crumbling and flaking off where i often place my feet causing bald spots on my mat . haha . weird , huh ? so now you know . other than that the mat is visually very pleasing
sports	the bike i ordered wouldve been a great christmas present had it not been dropped a few hundred times before i received it , both fenders damaged badly , and paint scraped off the frame in 3 spots
sports	i have recently purchased this item . i think that it is cheaper to by the new tube than buying patches for holes in a tube
sports	at first i was very happy with this stroller . i love the big wheels , the front one which swivels . the cup holders are convenient for both parent and baby . and the adjustable handle is awesome because i 'm short and i can push the stroller at a comfortable height . also it maneuvers very easily up and down curbs , steers easily even with one hand everywhere from the mall , museum , park , or on city streets . one of the biggest drawbacks for me has been the reclining seat back . there is a drawstring that you must adjust . this requires two hands and can be difficult at times if the child is fussy or uncooperative . despite this , i still loved the stroller until recently . however , after only two months of use , my stroller will not lock . it has actually folded up on my son while pushing it . i now can not even seem to lock it into the open position for use . i have not found any levers to snap in place to hold it open . and because the stroller folds outward , not inwards like an umbrella stroller , it actually pulls the childs body backwards when the locks give out . this is very dangerous . i am contacting the manufacturer about this defect
sports	when i bought the resistance bands i thought they were going to be much bigger than i thought . i havent used them since i bought them ... i sent in a questionairre sort-of-deal back to the company i bought them from requesting an exchange , but i havent heard a thing from them . i 'm not very pleased .
sports	looks like this is what i need for short hikes . a little on the heavy side , but good for day hikes
sports	very lightweight , fragile , and poorly finished . not sure what the `` hardwood '' actually is . it looks oak-like , but is far too lightweight for it 's size . it came a bit rough and splintery and only got worse over time . the lacquer or whatever it is that they finished it with developed spiderweb cracks almost immediately and then began to flake off . i only used it for kata ; did n't feel safe actually hitting anything with it let alone using it to defend against a weapon for tandem drills . after a few months of very little use , mostly sitting on the rack , it began to develop cracks . perhaps it was n't dried properly when they applied the finish ? regardless , the one i received ( 50 '' model ) was cheap junk . you get what you pay for ... not only not recommended , but downright dangerous if you hit anything with it . spend a little more to get better quality
sports	this table is so easy to assemble and is very lightweight for travel . we go airplane camping in a piper super cub so lightweight , compact and sturdy is a must for us . it comes in a handy travel bag . it 's a great table at a great price
sports	i was very hesitant to purchase this bike because of all the problems other people reported with parts coming damaged/rusty . the only problem i had was the bar on the rear-bottom would n't fit all the way into the slot to put one of the screws in . i tried really hard to get it in , but it just would n't budge . luckily , i could get the screw in on the other end , so it is relatively secure . the bike is a bit wobbly when your riding - now i do n't know if this is because of my problem with the bar , or because that 's just the way it is . but i do n't feel like it 's going to fall apart or tip over or anything . over all , this is a really nice bike . the price is absolutely the best for what you 're getting - especially if you choose the free super saver shipping . i got mine about a week from the day i ordered it . i do n't think you will find another bike comparable to this for the price . most recumbent bikes at this price do n't offer any kind of resistance , what to speak of programs or the pulse monitor . it is really quiet - i can do it at 5 in the morning while my daughter is sleeping in the next room and not have to turn the tv up too loud . the seat is a bit uncomfortable , but it 's not that big of a deal considering the price
sports	these cars can be summed up in two words fun and loud . i have two and my four year old loves it and so do all his friends . they work great throughout the house and hold their charge really well . i am even thinking of getting a third . they do leave little marks on the wood floors but it cleans easily . well worth it .
sports	received the ab roller and the box contained none of the hardware necessary for assembly . 5 days after emailing the company , they reply that they are unable to send the hardware and i must return it to them before they will send out a new box . very frustrating- i must drive 20 miles to the nearest ups store to return it . wish i had just bought the thing at walmart
sports	there is nothing wrong with the knife itself but there is a major design flaw . the ring to attach the knife to say a set of keys is on the wrong side ; so the open knife is not away from the set of keys . this is the first swiss army knife i have ever come across with this flaw . so alway make sure the ring is opposite the swiss army logo ! !
sports	i originally bought the blue ( 5 lb ) , red ( 7 lb ) and the black ( 9 lb ) gripmasters for my 14 year old boys . the blue is a little too easy for gripping but excellent for exercising the ring and little finger . the blue was too easy for them so they did not use it so i ended inherited it . it is pretty habit forming and fun to use because the tension is light , this makes it good for use anytime , anywhere . ( i have used it stuck in traffic and it is also a good stress reliever ) if i had to do it again , i would have probably not bought this tension unless you have a very light grip , probably have started with the red . just remember that this is mainly for fingers and hand exercise so very easy to use for gripping , the challenge is working out the fingers . it is not like using the regular heavy hand grippers . it has increased my hand strength and grip just by having it with me and using it during the course of the day without planned workouts . great product , excellent for finger or hand exercise , good quality
sports	i 've been using these gloves for 3 years now and i had to buy a new pair as they were starting to be ripped off between the fingers . what i like : easy to set good wrist support good grip with the middle bar what i do n't like : using wraps can be difficult if you do n't take a size above and i recommend wraps otherwise the leather will burn your skin . for the price and the time that i 've used them ( 2-3 times a week on heavy bags ) , they performed very well
sports	this is the second time that i purchased this backpack . the first time was over 5 years ago when my son was starting highschool . now he is a 2nd year student in college and it is time to replace the original one . why not get the bag that has lasted so long
sports	the pogo stick that i ordered was not the same one that was sent to me in he mail . i have to say though that the return was easy . the company had ups come to my house and pick up the product and i was given a full refund immediatly . the item was not great ... but customer service was good
sports	if you want to picture yourself wrestling with poles , and pins while camping , then this is the item for you . the instructions are made only to confuse things more . it could be made so much more user friendly . once it 's up , it gets a thumbs up .
sports	absolutely no use to me whatsoever . next
sports	i was desperate for a fast way to get my youngest child to the park when my older children ride their bicycles . unfortunately the only thing in stock anywhere was this seat . and it took me all morning to get it put together . the holes for the straps to go into were so small i had to widen them with a screwdriver and shove them through the holes with the screwdriver as well . the screws to attach the seat to the seat post of my bike were too short , and the washers needed to be pried together . finally i was nearing the final steps , when lo and behold , i was missing a piece . i call customer support , which is at bell , not fisher price or mattel . i was on hold for 20 minutes before i was able to speak to anyone . then when i spoke to the representative , she put me on hold to speak to her supervisor for another 15 minutes . this happened twice . their solution to my missing piece ? use a zip tie , `` we do n't ship that piece separately . '' excuse me ? you make a mistake , you fix it . regardless of whether or not `` the piece is shipped separately . ridiculous . and at the end of the conversation , there was no apology offered , no attempt to make the situation right . ugh . so now , i have nothing to show for my morning of effort . also , i attempted to adjust the strap on the seat to see how it would fit my daughter . i sat her in the seat , and she barely fits . she is two years old , barely weighs 23 pounds , and is tiny . i have no idea how a child any bigger than her would even fit in the seat . i had hoped to use this seat for family rides for the nextfew years . that would not happen with this seat . so , it is going back to the store , and i am buying a kettler flipper , or a bobike maxi , or a topeak . i will steer clear of bell products in the future ! oh , and to top it all off , the helmet provided with the seat has the plastic cover peeling off without me even removing it from the packaging ! ! worthless . save your time and your money , avoid this seat at all costs
sports	i bought both the ark iii and the super ark . the super ark is a slight improvement over the ark iii but i would never recommend people buy either one . there are far better entry-level kits , for just a few dollars more , available from other sources . the ark iii contains 24 oz . of water , a food bar , and a small , inexpensive emergency blanket in a kleenex-sized cardboard box . i 'll use the products in the two kits to supplement the emergency kits i subsequently purchased . i 'm surprised - and disappointed - amazon carries these products
sports	it 's always satisfying to see that a determined manufacturer can significantly improve even the simplest of devices . it 's a pleasure to hold and use this bottle . i like : * not having to tip your head up to drink , since the mouthpiece is connected to a straw inside that goes to the bottom - i 've never seen this design before * easy to flip open with one hand , yet you do n't have to pull hard with your teeth like in standard designs * absense of taste compared to plastic bottles i do n't like : * diameter of the bottle is too wide to fit standard cage all the way . it takes a lot of force to push it in about 2/3 of the way and it does n't go further . it has n't flown out during riding yet , but i am looking for a wider cage now ( not easy to find ) . why not make it standard diameter for bike cages
sports	did n't pump any air into the tire the first 2 `` stomps '' ... tried it again another day , 3rd `` stomp '' and the gauge went flying off . put the gauge back on and it still does n't work . biggest waste of money . never even filled one tir
sports	this product is ineffective . the snorkel gets stuck , either open so that water pours in while you 're trying to breathe , or stuck shut so you can not take a breath of air while under water . it 's is very distressing when you 're out in deep water snorkelling and the breathing tube fails to perform ! i often take in mouthfuls of water , or worse ; suck for a breath of air and get nothing ! it is therefore useless , i stopped using the tube as it is more trouble than good . i bought two sets , one for my partner and one for myself , and they both fail to perform . the mask on one set broke after 2 months ( the metal pin became dislodged ) and the tightening clips on the flippers frequently fall off while trying to tighten them to your feet . the bag 's zippers rusted not long after use ... given that most people snorkel in salt water , you think they would have considered rust proofing the metal . overall the quality of these not-so-cheap kits are embarrassingly bad . we both felt awkward snorkeling with them , and sometimes i even felt they were hazardous . we tossed these products and bought cressi brand gear . it has changed our underwater experience
sports	when i got this gun , i thought it looked really cool , but when i tried to shoot it , the bullets just rolled out of the barrell ! the few bullets that did shoot worked well . i did not have a good experience with this gun
sports	i take yoga in a gym . the class starts as the aerobics session ends . i bought these socks to help keep my feet warm during class . using the socks my big toes were uncomfortably separated from the rest of my foot . i expected more elastic . they made my foot cramp during the class . because i had worn them once i could not return them . now i do not know what to do with them . i should throw them out but i spent money on them
sports	i bought this for myself to play with ( i 'm 35 ) and after all the presents were opened and toys , video games , and everything were forgotten ( about 4 hours after christmas ) , this was the ongoing favorite of the season . everybody , younger ( down to 8 ) and older ( to 45 ) had a blast with this thing after a couple minutes coaching . it 's already on everybodys wish lists for upcoming birthdays and such . this is a great present for 11-18 boy . fair warning though , there will be some good spills on the fairly short , steep learning curve - helmets , knee pads , blah , blah , are a must ( and a video camera !
sports	i just saw this toy in parents magazine sunday night and was so excited to see it on sale at target this week . i ran to get it since my [ ... ] son is too short to use his hand-me-down red tricycle . it looked like lots of fun in the picture , however , my son is too big for it ! i do n't know why it states that it is suitable for up to 3 years old- no way ! if it were adjustable , i 'm sure he would have loved it , but just like another reviewer stated- it 's just like the other ride-on toys we already own . currently , the scuttle bug is in the trunk ready to be returned to the store . how disappointing
sports	i am a huge ski person and i got the jump it is so small for me because i am do like 50 feet drops all the time . ___________________my suggestion___________________ this is good for you starting your kid out on there first scooter they got for the holidays or skate board what ever you get him and its good for those things . not ideal what so ever for skiing . i got it to practice low ground tricks like a 180 at least so go for it if you are doing it for your son or daughter with there first scooter or bike or skateboard not skiing
sports	i was just looking at tennis rackets , on the amazon site . the next thing i get is an email to say i have agreed to purchase one . i did not press to conferm this order , but amazon kept my credit card details on record and used them . nicola bradle
sports	i use the ir interface with the polar s625x running computer , and i have never encountered a single problem . i usually use the interface in to different computers , a notebook at home ( with xp ) , and a desktop at work ( 2000 ) , and in both computers it works nicely . you have to be careful and follow the directions that come with the ir interface . install the software and drivers before you connect the device to the computer . i love my polar watch , and the ir interface is an excellent complement for an excellent product .
sports	this is exactly what i was looking for . i had a very similar roller at my gym ( club one ) and loved it , but left the gym a while ago . a previous reviewer states that this product might be useless without the weight attachment . do n't worry , it comes with it , and it works perfectly . i interchange standard-sized weights all the time ... have tested with up to 30lbs ( 30lbs is killer on your wrists , and i 'm a fairly strong man ) if you want a gym-quality wrist roller , buy this now
sports	to say that this mat is very slippery is an understatement . it is basically unuseable ! i wound up throwing it aside the first time i tried it out . a complete waste of money
sports	i really like this bike . it feels like a bike from the '50s but with all the modern technology . the look is great and draws a lot of attention . it is somewhat simple to complete the bike since it arrives mostly put together but the assembly instructions are the worst i have ever seen with any product . i basically got no clue from the instructions on how to finish off the bike , it is hard to believe how poorly they are written . i was beginning to believe they sent me the wrong directions . after i got it together through trial and error the brakes and the shifter were way out of whack and i had to spend $ 30 at a local bike shop to get these items adjusted ; the instructions for making the adjustment did not work . the guys at the bike shop took two attempts to get it right ( two trips for me ) and they were wondering why it was so difficult to adjust . after all that was done i love the bike and it rides nicely and when properly adjusted , shifts and brakes very nicely . the ride is comfortable and i love the seat and location of the handlebars . i would recommend the bike for all the fun and looks it has but be prepared for some hassle to get it right unless you are one of the lucky ones who gets one that is adjusted correctly out of the box . my suggestion is for the manufacture of this bike to fire the idiot who wrote the assembly instructions and hire someone with some writing skills . i also do not understand why the brakes and shifter were so far out of adjustment ; did no one test the bike before they boxed it up
sports	this sounds very stupid , i 'm sure , but i ca n't get the battery cover off in order to put in the battery . i unscrew it with a coin as i 'm told , but when i ca n't turn it with the coin anymore , i still ca n't get the darn thing open
sports	the velcro belt tore off after the second use ! within a week of purchase ! the material for the vest is not durable enough for so much weight
sports	i love the idea of this ... sleek , out of the way for transit but readily available on the road , protected when not in use . unfortunately , the reality is a hard to use product that does little to improve road safety . because of the narrowness of the mirror , it 's very difficult to focus on what is actually behind you with a quick glance . sure , if you sit there for 10 seconds you can figure it out , but i do n't have that sort of time when i 'm dodging through chicago traffic ! save your money and buy the excellent mirrcycle instead
sports	this is not the fault of amazon or even the product . i wasused to a gym quality rower ( conceptii ) which allows a lot of resistance . the integrity 3000 allows for hardly any resistance . i am in the process of sending it back . the machine itself was good but did not offer enough of a challenge . an expensive lesson
sports	if i could give them 0 stars , i would . i do n't know why they even still make these , as they should be illegal -- and so should all that laminated foam rubber stuff they use in karate . the materials break up easily ; the stuffing shifts and starts flying all over the place . i could give tens of reasons why these are not only inferior , but complete garbage right out of the box . everlast in general simply is n't good : low quality materials , design and workmanship , but these win the prize for all time worst sports equiptment in my book . i recommend buying entirely ringside -- and this is coming from an experienced full-contact fighter
sports	in my opinion , this thing is flimsy and worthless . i set it up in the doorway and it is so poorly designed that it just does n't hold . once you bring the bar crashing into your forehead on your first or second chin-up , you realize that you 've already thrown away your money and now it 's time to throw away this product . i absolutely agree with the reviewer who cautions against making this product available to kids without close supervision
sports	the bar is very solid and has a good looking chrome finish . it takes olympic weight plates ( 2 inch diameter . ) the shipping and packaging are good too . overall , i have no complaint with this purchase . i would recommend this bar
sports	seems i may have already broke this bar - twisted it to stop it from spinning while i was doing exercise and heard a pop now it spins all the time i use it - not happy : ( i did not force it a suprised such a sturdy looking piece would break already
sports	i bought this machine because of the low price , and i was skeptical whether it would be worthwhile . however , i was very pleasantly surprised . it is a great machine , especially for beginners who want upper body workouts . if you 're a serious athlete , or if you want leg exercises , this may not be the best machine for you . for me , it is working out great , and i have purchased other machines to give me the leg exercises i want . at first , i was dismayed by the fact that there were over 100 parts to assemble , but they went together very quickly and easily , and all the tools are included . be advised that this is only for users weighing up to 120 kilograms , or 264 pounds . great product
sports	blackburn racks are getting harder to find , but they are still at the top of the pile in terms of build quality and strength / weight . i have had blackburn racks on a couple bikes over the years and never had a complaint . one is still going strong after 20 years . highly recommended
sports	the ir link for the polar hear monitors is great . it allows you to transfer data 2 ways from your pc : you can download your exercise data , and also change the settings for the watch from the computer . this is great , because it means no scrolling through abbreviations on the watch with the tiny buttons . the biggest problem with the ir link is the driver that needs to be installed on your computer . for whatever reason , polar decided not to pay bill gates to get the software recognized as being compatible with microsoft . when installing the driver from the included cd , warnings and error messages pop up to discourage you from proceeding , which will compromise all security and firewall features that you might have . there is no updated version available for download from the internet . i went ahead and installed the driver , but since doing so , the computer has not been functioning properly , and i 've been getting those `` send error report / do n't send error report '' pop-ups from windows . polar denies responsibility and insists that their driver is `` fine '' for use . i 'm no computer expert , so i do n't know for sure , but i do n't believe them
sports	i purchased these for my parents who are both in their 80 's in order to bring some resistance training into their exercise programs . my dad takes 2 mile walks and manages the snow blower in the winter . my mother does some treadmill walking . they really enjoy using these bands and i think it is benefiting them . they are simple to use and effective as if you work hard enough you can definitely feel it
sports	nice looking skates , but very stiff boot and runs too small . do n't like the stiffness of the boot . will not buy another rd product
sports	this case was ordered to hold some medical equipment that must travel with me on my about two-weeks-per-month business travel . the good part is that this case will probably survive falling into a black hole . the bad part is that it takes up half my carry-on suitcase . but that 's what you pay to have protection for expensive equipment
sports	the handles on these knives , while having good balance , are the weak point . these knives are n't meant to be thrown . after minimal use they broke - at the handle
sports	this gun was okay when i first started using it . it 's really a backyard gun , and should only be used for beginners . i had it on my bed , which is about two feet high , and it fell when my dog jumped on , the barrel broke . the spring in the magazine also broke . there are better guns out there , but if you just want to have some good clean fun in your backyard , this is the gun for you . the sight is a pretty nice feature .
sports	they dont even go where u want them to they suc and i dont recomend buying the
sports	two amazon 's statements about this product were absolutely misleading : 1 . `` usually ships in 24 hours '' . it actually took 1 week to ship it . 2 . when i finally received the package it turned out that the watch did n't have `` leather band '' . the band was made of artificial materials ( nylon and rubber ) or something like that . i will have to return it
sports	yes , you 'll feel your muscles contracting . if they were really contracting to a degree worthy of being called exercise , the contractions would scare the heck out of you : you 'd either feel like your whole core was paralyzed or you 'd be going into an spastic , involuntary crunch . do n't worry , that wo n't happen . the machine is n't strong enough . ( try this : tense up your abs..more..a little more ... relax and do it again a few times , for a minute or so ... thats already way more exercise than you 'll get from the 'ab sonic ' . ) if you 're a therapy patient who has a poor muscular awareness , perhaps this will help you begin to get enough feeling back to move on to a real exercise program . if your spinal cord is severed , this may be all you can do to get a little musuclar stimulation ... fine . this is not exercise . it may 'remind ' you to tense your abs in order to not look like a fat slob , but why not just remind -yourself- ? it 's not powerful enough to do do any real strengthening , and even if it was , it by-passes the most important part of your workout : the will . you are n't learning the effort of tensing the muscles , or tolerating greater stress , you 're just electronically agitating the muscles . in the end , this has zero effect on strength , muscular development , work tolerance , and function . are you in therapy ? no ? then why are you trying -so hard- to avoid -moving- your body
sports	the only satisfaction i have gotten out of this product is this opportunity to vent . if the price seems too cheap , it is . where to begin ? instructions , pretty bad . hardware , missing , inconsistent , inadequate . design , deeply flawed . mounting , not on my standard mountain bike . manufacture , cheap , cheap , cheap . what result culminated my frustrating evening retrofitting it just to see if it would work ? i 'll spare you the suspense , it did n't . not a glimmer .
sports	i am very happy with my choice . it is just the right size , nicely finished with glossy black paint , installs in a minute . usage is very convenient : it has that perfect click-into-place property : you push down on it with your forefoot and it snaps into the `` stand '' position . to `` hide '' it when you are ready to go , just hit back with your heel or simply start pedalling and it snaps back along the frame . it does the job perfectly and it feels great
sports	our kids loved this - so much so that when one dropped it and broke the plastic strip by the on/off button ( making the toy unusable ) , i bought another one . would n't you know the same thing happened a few weeks later ? this toy is supposed to be made for small children who have been known to drop things on occasion ... the manufacturer needs to correct this problem
sports	i did n't like these at all . the toes are too pointy and would n't fit . might be ok for younger children than stated .
sports	i have used this unit twice and have been more impressed each time . first time was a loaner from my favorite golf shop and the second was the unit that i just purchased . my reaction ... wow . great tool for golfers at all skill levels . the information presented appears to be extremely accurate and is much more accurate than guessing or finding a marker and then interpolating distances . i found the intelligreen feature extremely useful . i was able to shoot at several greens unseen whereas before i would have laid up in a safe visible landing zone short of the green . the target lists were consistent with the features i was concerned about on most holes . if anything , i found the target list to contain too many items i found registration and set up a bit tedious and would like to sky golf make it easier . be sure to read the installation instructions in the manual very closely . your internet browser must be set to allow cookies from sky golf . otherwise you may spend all day and never get set up or be able to download courses . the variety of plans for course downloads is adequate , but i wish they would include at least a 1 year subscription to the basic `` par '' sky player course download plan with the purchase of the unit . others have complained about quality and construction . i do n't know what their standards are , but my unit seems well constructed and of very high quality material . bottom line , if you can afford it and you 're looking for a great product to improve you knowledge of the golf courses you play ... then this product is for you .
sports	this will work only if you are doing work outs , while you are not doing work outs if you wear this , i do n't think it would be of any help .
sports	i was tired of the rental skates and wanted to be able to zip around the floor with my kids at the skating rink . so i bought these skates . at the time , it felt a little impulsive to spend so much on skates . well , now i know i should have spent more and at least be happy with what i purchased . i had such a hard time skating with these skates , and when i talked to the guy at the pro shop and 2 people online ( there are a lot of resources online-do a search for quad skates ) i realized these skates were made for beginning kids , never a 36 year old mom ! they are not made to do the kind of things on the floor you think you might be able to do . in fact , i could n't even turn . i kept having to push off because they would slow down . i kept adjusting them and had a professional at the rink adjust them for me , and forget it ! i 'm selling them at the resale shop and spending more money to at least get something decent
sports	three things to consider in a yoga block : size , material , color . this thing is purple = ugly . the material is foam , and this block will still be around 1 million years after i die - for a more environmentally sound purchase try cork , for double the price , of course . finally , i like the size of this block , most blocks are 3x5x9 , this one is 4x6x9 which means that its more stable
sports	this gun broke in the first few used . when i called for service , they inisted on waiting for the tech , and then the return was going to cost almost what the gun cost . overall ... this was a writeoff
sports	i like this whistle 's slim design . i wear it when shopping in rough areas . if i am apprehended , i intend to use the whistle to draw attention to me and the assailant . this whistle is much louder than my voice , and carries well across other sounds .
sports	not like the picture at all and very cheap looking and didnt form to the head correctly . must have been stuck in the box too long ! ... .husband said ... send it back ! needless to say , we got a refund
sports	i bought this ear plugs , are uncomfortable , my ears hurt , and in the first use , just fall down i just prefered the ones who are made of pvc , are better
sports	i use this radar `` gun '' to see how fast my shot is in lacrosse..it works perfectly..there is no use in buying one over 200 dollers ... i mean , its a radar gun ... it is worth your money :
sports	due to lack of space , and in need of activity i have decided to buy a mini stepped to increase my daily phsycial activity . this one i bought from a retail market and the reason for me to choose particularly this one was the price ( of course ) , the flexbands with counter . very limited documentation , it does n't tell you actually how you can adjust the difficulty levet , i figured out a better way after two weeks by experimenting the device . and then it sarted to make craking noises . so i used some olive oil on the joints that passed . then the suspensions got air inside and at the very begging of the step it started to make a crack noise which i could n't evade at all . while experirmenting the device , the electronic part got loose , it was attached with a soo thin cable , one touch and the cable was torn off . ok i said that was my fault , i should n't have touched it . but ... today , the `steel` cable that holds the pedals got apart . that is so suprizing , i am only 80 kg , and using it usually every two days for 30 minutes ... very bad construction . ok ... why i gave 2 stars ? the flexicables worked really well . that deserves a point .
sports	when one trips the safety key , one has to power the treadmill off then on to get the treadmill going again . this action looses all the time and distance information . the keys fitness , who manufactures ironman and a bunch of others , help line confirmed that this is normal for their products . i see this as a safety problem because many people will bypass the safety key by not clipping it on their body
sports	the goal arrived at my house assembled wrong , then after it was fixed be me , i successfully put it together , which was relativly easy . after several moderately hard training sessions two large holes were in the net . that is on top of the fact that the pins that hold the net together are weak . the weakness in the pins causes the goal to collapse if there is a shot off of the post . overall , this is probably not a good buy .
sports	i purchased the kwik kik for my 11-year-old to use as a training aid for the recreational soccer program he is involved with . it was fairly easy to put together and , once the base is filled with sand ( it can not be filled with water ) , it 's simple to move it from place to place . the kwik kik is a great way to build up the strength and stamina in his feet and legs ! i love the fact that he can use it either in-doors or out-doors , so he 'll be able to use it to keep training throughout the year . great product
sports	i had seen this table at an outdoor concert and have been looking for some time to find it . just recently i saw one being used at a resort while we were on vacation . it is easy to set up and very stable . we will use it for picnics as well as an additional table on our deck . the carry bag is another plus . no more bending over to serve food from the top of the cooler .
sports	only heats the palm of your hand , fingers stay cold . no elements in the fingers of the glove , only heating element is in the palm of your hand . not worth the money ,
sports	i love this machine . the strech is allowed to happen at a slow and gentle pace and the legs are nicely supported . the only draw-back is the retraction process sometimes i have to push a little futher in order to release the latch to pull the legs back in . other then that b e a utifu
sports	this software is completely useless with an explorist gps unit . i am sending the gps i just purchased , along with this software , back to amazon . the software will not communicate with the gps , and the company will not respond to any of my support requests , the web page has none of the patches that are supposed to be available , and the live technical support is a complete joke . after 20 minutes of being on hold , i spoke with a gentleman that barely spoke english , and offered me no help ... i knew more about the software than him , and i 've only owned it 3 days . i 'll never purchase from magellan again
sports	the brace or axle to hold the goal in an upright position was to short and could n't be used . a new one had to be purchased
sports	placed the order on 11/20 , delivery was supposed to be by 12/9 . on about 12/1 i contacted the company that amazon said was the provider , unbeatable sale , inc. to verify that they did have the order . unbeatable said that it was an amazon order , period , and gave me a number at amazon to contact . amazon said that unbeatable had the bike on back order because they fill their direct orders first . cancelled the order and found a similar bike for 20 dollars less at walmart .
sports	it is very well made . works very well for our use.we are into model rockets.we keep our motors in the box.fills our needs great . steven rushin
sports	this does not fit on super 9 rifles as far as i know . besides , it first off has a too high zoom and also is tiny ! ( most scopes are whatever zoom x30 . for example , i own a 3-9x44 scope . this means it is adjustable from 3 to 9 times zoom . the second number refers to the size of the scope lens . i 'd seriously reccomend a 3x30 if you can get one . also make sure it 's dovetail if its for the super9 otherwise make sure it is a weaver rail . if you are getting it for the super 9 do not forget to unscrew the rear sight ( peephole )
sports	this gun is a good gun after the first charge . the problems are : the clip jamms and u need to get a screw driver , the laserr is in accurate . thats all thats worrng . good things are : after the first charge its powerfull and accurate . its nice and ajdustable for anyones fit . its worth i would think atleast 50 bucks . its just a good gun , nothing special
sports	let me start out by saying that this rower is not perfect . it is , in fact , flawed . as you may have noticed , i still gave it a five star rating and i will try to explain the reasons for doing so . reading the reviews here , i noticed two complaints : one pointing out that this machine does n't perform to the same standards that professional gym rowers do and the other regarding assembly of this machine . i researched the various rowers available in the market for quite a while . i spent a lot of time and effort driving around and trying various models before purchasing this one simply because i tend to be an informed shopper who wants to get value for his money . during my research , it became very evident that my favorite rower is a water rower followed by schwinn 's windrigger - both were extremely smooth in their operation . both were also about $ 1000 ! at any rate , these sophisticated rowers gave me a benchmark against which to compare the integrity and it should surprise nobody that the integrity does n't really come close to the performance of either of the other two rowers . and it should n't , given it substantially lower price . and this is exactly what it important in considering this rower : you can not expect to get a professional-grade rower for such a low price just like you can not expect to get the comfort and performance of a rolls royce if you are buying a honda . nonetheless , what you do get from integrity is well within the parameters of what i would expect for about $ 200 . the machine is reasonably stable , it is reasonably smooth , and it does provide a great workout . the noise level is also not too bad and actually seems less than that of the windrigger . the electric monitor is basic and provides speed , time , calories burned , and distance . it also provides an option that continuously cycles through all these functions so you cant track all of them during your workout . the seat is comfortable and slides smoothly along the track and the whole thing actually has a pretty professional look to it and does n't appear flimsy . i was also quite surprised by the level of resistance this rower provides - it is much more than that of the schwinn windrigger . in addition , resistance can be adjusted pretty easily . i think my only disappointment is that the air-flow created during operation is not channeled toward the person using the machine to aid in cooling him/her down - but this is certainly a flaw i can live with . as a potential buyer you should also be aware that the rower tends to slide across smooth surfaces such as tile - which means you need to have a non-slip mat under it if you intend to use it on such a surface . as i said before , i also read that at least one person had a problem assembling this rower . i can not confirm this problem . assembly was extremely easy and quick - even though the instructions are not the greatest . however , it should be quite clear to most people where parts go and what needs to be hooked up where . winding up the chain onto the gear wheel is a breeze , too . all you need to do is unhook it from the retracting cord that you hooked it up to one or two steps before . i suppose the person who wrote the instructions could have switched these steps to make it more logical - but as i said , the instructions are not great . taking all these factors into account , i think integrity provides a fantastic product for a very low price . it does exactly what it is supposed to do and it does so in a surprisingly good manner . however , as with any product , your expectations should be realistic and if they are , you will not be disappointed . if you expect a gym-quality machine - you will not get what you are looking for . if , however , you are looking for a basic functional rower without all the bells and whistles of high-end products , then this is probably the best deal you can get
sports	the table appeared to be exactly expected regarding quality . the shipment was also timely . unfortunately , we had to return the table as `` the style was not quite right '' for the situation of our game room
sports	i did get a nice little buzz the first two days i took this product , and it does give you a boost when you take it right before you work out . you can push yourself a bit further at the gym . the gassiness and stomach discomfort are what cause me to not recommend this product . it was n't so good or effective that the side effects were worth it . i had no lasting weight loss when taking it , just lost 3 lbs the first 2 days taking it which climbed back on a day later . i 'd skip it
sports	the overall steel frame and structure of it is good , but there are too many flaws with this product , i recommend going with something else . flaws : 1 ) bands do not give you good increments of resistence . if you want even resistance on each side , you go from 20 lbs to 40lbs in one setting , which is crazy . 2 ) workout and assembly manuals are terrible . especially the workout manual - what use is a machine if the correct use of it is not demonstrated ? what does that really say about how much stamina cares about people using it correctly , without injury , and getting good benefit out of it ? only about 10 exercises are really shown , the rest are just single pictures that let 's you vaguely guess at what you are supposed to do , except that many are for some other machine , not this one . i 'm sure someone will get injured from incorrect use . 3 ) many of the pictures are misleading , such that you ca n't actually do many of the exercises suggested or inferred by the pictures . one customer service person told me the pictures were of some prototype machine . ridiculous . 4 ) several construction pieces i received were bad and caused problems , but replacement parts were shipped with no problem , albeit it meant waiting a week or so for each one , and then time to reconstruct the machine . i had to replace the main rail and a main leg support frame piece because they were both welded wrong . 5 ) leg padding is inadequate and painful 6 ) does n't seem to be a product that is understood or cared about by stamina , no one i called seems to use it or really can tell you about it . for a company that claims to care about health and fitness , they really do n't show it with this product or support for this product . i 'd go elsewhere .
sports	i just bought the speedbelt 2 , deciding that the 4 bottle belt would be more cumbersome for me . so far , the 2 bottle belt has worked well for me in the 5-10 mile run range . it fits 2 gels comfortably and 10 ozs of water in each bottle . for longer runs , i 'd suggest the 4-bottle belt , but this one is great for the intermediate range . the belt fits comfortably and i did n't feel that it bounced around much at all . recommended
sports	this lunch box is top quality , with lots of room for snacks and even lunch for two . the quality is superior and i highly recommend it . there is an area for your flatwear , salt and pepper shaker and other compartments for snacks . there is even a compartment for your soda . i have been shopping around for a quality lunch bag and this one is it . great for travel , work and picnics for two
sports	this may be the 'outdoorsy ' ubergeek watch . it 's big , it 's ugly , but has functions to make the fattest swiss army knife sit in the corner sobbing in jealousy . overall , i like it but there are a couple of things that sound better than they are . the timepiece : outstanding . it has hh : mm : ss dd : mmm , of course , with a year setting to avoid leap year issues . this should go without saying in a modern digital watch . stopwatch with lap function ( not that i ever use the lap function , but i 'm sure someone is interested ) . countdown timer that can run up to a 24 hour countdown ( very easy to set ) . three daily alarms . special kudos for the alarms , this is one of the loudest watch alarms i 've heard , and i 've missed too many watch alarms to not appreciate this . the altimeter : largely eye candy , but kind of neat . over four days , my bedroom went from 100m above sea level to 25 m below sea level ( by the maps , about 40m asl ) . not surprising because it is driven by the barometer , and i never recalibrated it , but a graphic demonstration of the importance of calibrating it when you want/need it . the barometer : yup , it 's a barometer . the part i like is the little display that shows the rising/falling trend , especially as this is always active ( even in normal 'time ' mode ) . the thermometer : take the watch off to get an accurate reading as the sensor is too close to the wrist . the compass : easily the best 'special ' feature . accurate , precise ( enough for orienteering , not for surveying ) , easy to use . it can be programmed for a declination , but knowing me , i 'd forget to reset it , so i do declination the hard way . the sighting notches are small but servicable . the spirit level bubble is unique among digital watch compasses to suunto , and greatly enhances accuracy and confidence in the compass . an outstanding wrist compass . the package : big . really , really big . but the controls are very easy to use and seem fairly resistant to accidental button pressing ( a problem for me with other watches ) . the battery has a shortish ( 12-18 month ) life , but has a hatch , so you do n't need to take it to a jeweller to get it replaced without ruining the water resistance . the display has large characters and high contrast to the back ground , and the display light is just right , readible , even , and glare free , but not an emergency flashlight . personally , i 'm going to swap the resin band for a velcro strap , but the stock strap is n't bad , just not great . overall , not a watch for the office or a suit but very good as a watch , compass and barometer , and about what you could expect as a thermometer and altimeter . well designed , thought-out , and manufactured , but really big .
sports	do n't buy these cards . they are of very low quality . i bought 4 decks -- several cards in each deck where visibly marked . you will be better off paying a few dollars more for high-quality cards .
sports	i bought this product to use during my camping trips . i had a minor issue with my order but was corrected immediately , great customer service . this is a really neat hammock , it packs really small but is very resistant . my friends loved it when they saw it and it was really easy to set up . you will enjoy it whether you go camping or on your backyard
sports	be sure you have a very flat , smooth surface for these bumper cars . there is almost zero clearance between the driving surface and the bumper part of the car . our girls rode them in our driveway/sidewalk and constantly got stuck on uneven surfaces or the edge of the driveway . we had to make the girls get out and pick up and move the car to a flat surface . these are probably much better for a basement or a perfectly flat surface like a tennis or basketball court .
sports	the pedometer is just too sensitive ! ! it tends to over state the number of steps that i have taken . i like the item but i cut the number of steps that i have taken by third . so , if i am tageting 10,000 steps a day i try to go 13,333 so that i can be sure that i really hit my target . the item itself is well made , light weight and easy to use and set .
sports	as the 'blow up ' float toys come and go , the sea breeze float still looks like new and is still the preferred float . the only problem is sharing . we love it
sports	overall , the system is useable but there are multiple areas of potential improvement . the most important area for improvement is the height of the weight bench . it is too high so there is no way to perform a traditional bench press . second , the pegs that hold the weight bar in place are positioned where one would normally place their hands . there is no way around this other than narrowing your grip . the fly bars are awkward and tend to bang against the bench support . the lateral pull bar provides resistance through some palstic housing which i am pretty sure will wear out in a short period of time . the weight bench has basically been relegated to my off day strength work outs since it does not provide the stability and support for a vigorous weight session .
sports	neoprene pouch keeps water cool , but it has a very strong displeasing smell , kind of like used motoroil , which overpowers the taste of what your drinking from the bottle . so you might want to pour your drink into a cup to enjoy it .
sports	this case is mainly made of plastic ! ! do n't be fooled by the `` aluminum '' description , only the corners were aluminum , the rest just painted plastic . the case came poorly packaged ! the box was too small for the case . the case had scuff marks , and scratches on it . obviously not brand new ! ! this was the worst purchase i 've ever made on amazon . will never buy adg sports again ! ! ! their label was crooked on the case too ! ! looks like a 4-year-old put it on ! ! do n't waste your money ! trust me ! !
sports	living in florida i bought two of these everlight flashlights . the party that said there was enough charge during shippins is a little shaking in the head . it takes at least a couple of minutes of of shaking before there is even a glimmer of light . after that if you do n't continue to shake it dies out very rapidly . this light may possibly come in handy during a hurricane power failure but there are other led flashlights with batteries that are superior to this one . the power used by these leds is low and the batteries last a long time .
sports	we looked all over for a quality dartboard with a cabinet , and this one was by far the best for its price .

sports	i ordered this sleeping bag on 12/07/06 , i chose standard shipping which is 3 to 5 days . this was more then enough time i needed to have the sleeping bag arrive before christmas . here it is 01/10/07 , and still the sleeping bag has not arrived . my account says it was shipped on 12/11/06 . when i track the item it says expected delivery date is 01/31/07 . nothing was ever stated when i placed the order that the delivery date would be 01/31/07 . only 3 - 5 days . this is the most ridiculous thing i ever heard ! i had other items placed with this order that i have received off and on out of the blue before and after christmas . there are 3 all together that i never received at all from target . i counted on these items for christmas and i am very disappointed with amazon and target . i have done alot of business with amazon and in the future i will never , never give any of my business to amazon if the order is connecrted to target in any way ! ! ! ! target amazon deserve 0 stars for terrible service , and false advertisement !
sports	i was impressed by all the reviews that said that how quiet the machine was when i bought it . assembly was not so bad ( 2.5 hours ) . then the squeeking started . just about after 100 calories burned , there would be a two distinct squeeks at a specific position of the flywheel . we called technical service and the service person called back on the 5th day ( he needed to respond before 5 days ) and scheduled a visit for a day 10 days after that . the technician inspected the machine and said that such sound was normal , and adjusted the tension on some screws and left . now the squeeking is starts right after beginning the workout . it is loud . as in , you need earplugs , loud . another call to tech support ...
sports	we found the system very hard to read . at night we could n't see it at all to read it . our family bought us the better model for xmas , so we are going to put this one on ebay . would not recommend it
sports	i bought this for my brother , he loved it ! i was worried that it is a little big , but apparently fisherman have a lot of stuff : - ) he said it was just right
sports	be forwarned , that this is more for isolated toning legs , arms , shoulders.hips , rather than pilates workout . does not strengthen the core muscles like pilates does and may weaken them . the trainer on the dvd has flabby abs , and thick torso , rather than long lean muscles and core muscle strength that is usually found when doing pilates workouts . i found the equipment bulky and awkward to use , hard to hold my body in good alignment and almost impossible to do the exercises from my power center , very disappointed in dvd training that accompanies the set . and serious questions about whether this routine weakens the abs , after my experience with it and seeing the condition of the abds of the trainer . it is not up to the caliber of what i have come to expect from pilates . also feel there is risk of injury related to difficulty of holding body in correct alignment , as equipment kept slipping down or up . need to go back to the drawing board on this one , there are better , less expensive , better made options out there , with better training . keep on looking .
sports	this really is a cool , pedal-free bike . we got it for our three-and-a-half-year-old , and he really likes it . friends of ours ( with more disposable income ) bought their daughter a like-a-bike , which is about twice the price . i have yet to discover any big difference in performance . the like-a-bike is certainly nice-looking , if a bit precious , since it is constructed primarily out of wood . the kettler looks fine , however -- more like a `` real '' bike , in fact , and less like a museum piece . the only reasons i would n't give the kettler five stars are : 1. you need to assemble it , and the instructions are not great ( my husband , who is generally a handy guy , managed to get it together , but not without some swearing ) 2. the wheel covers make it hard to inflate the tires
sports	i was so happy to order this . it has n't even been put together yet ... in box for two weeks . they sent the wrong hardware with it . i emailed them 2 times and got no response . after twenty minutes of trying i finally got a human voice . she was nice and shipped the parts . they arrived today and guess what ? the same wrong parts again . i ca n't get a response so i guess i will have to also go and purchase the stuff to put it together . at least i have a list from the owner 's manual . overall experience was a big fat bust
sports	i bought the trailer to take my granddaughter with me when i rode on vacation when i assembled the trailer , the chain was twisted . i bought a chain tool to break the chain and straighten it . then the chain kept falling off the front chainwheel . the sprocket was badly bent . i bought a large screwdriver to straighten the chainwheel . by the time i got it all working , my vacation was over . by the time i see my granddaughter again , she 'll have her own bike . i 'm going to try to find someone with a small child to give the trailer to
sports	the first time i used it , i hit it about 20 times before the ball broke off and went flying into nearby woods . my mom had ordered it from sharper image . she called them and they said the would replace the ball . they never did . i have not found a place to order replacement parts .
sports	front wheel was badly bent right out of the box and needed to be replaced . box had no signs of damage so it looks like it was put into the box this way . i replaced the front rim at my own expense and assembled the bike only to find it also needed a tuneup . the gear shifters were not adjusted properly and shifting would often result in the chain jumping back and forth . i did n't want to pay for a tuneup and hope there would n't be other expenses down the road to deal with so i decided to return the bike and buy something local i can get a look at before we buy
sports	i am not a big spender , but unlike a lot of things , the more money you spend , the better bike you get . i really did n't want to spend a lot for a bike for a 5-year-old , and i wish i would have gone with my first instinct and bought one from a bike shop . i 'm so frugal that i could n't stand the idea of paying $ 140 for a bike for a kid , so i got this one instead ( which was actually more expensive when i bought it . ) this is a mediocre bike at best , maybe one step above a big box store bike , just maybe . i wanted a simple bike that would last while , but i will be surprised if this one makes it one summer . paint chips easily and the white bike seat is clean for only the first few minutes out of the box . the components seem cheap and the frame does not seem very solid . the difference between this one and a good ( expensive ) bike is huge . i had a bike shop put it together and i added a basket , so the difference between what i paid for this and what i would have paid for a good bike was about $ 30 . i 'm kicking myself now .
sports	i bought this elliptical three month ago unwilling to pay big bucks ( over $ 1,000 ) for recommended models , hoping to make an exclusion from the rule . no , it did not happened . starting with the errors in assemble instrucions in the manual , inaccurate display readings , and so on , ending with a squicky and noisy piece of ... equipment . their customer service is just a place to order parts , although they sent me some parts i broke when assemling - a threat on the bolt , a couple of broken ( by me ) plastic part . i noticed that i 'm using this machine more rarely because i just do n't like the way it works . if i new what i was going to get , i did not buy it
sports	this skate was purchased for 6 year old granddaughter and given as a `` santa '' gift ... the hit of the day ! although she has n't had much opportunity to use them yet , she did try them out one evening at an indoor rink and they seemed to work just fine . they are nice looking and fit is true to size

sports	this pedometer is so cheap it is n't worth the $ 1.88 pricetag . unless you want to cheat yourself , this is not the pedomter for you . you gain 20 steps just putting it on your pants , then walking to my co-workers desk five steps from mine i gained about 30 steps . by the end of my work day i had apparently walked 11,953 steps that i mostly acquired turning in my office chair , and i wo n't even go on to say how many steps you gain driving in your car . on top of all this , the company would n't refund me on the pedometers i ordered for my co-workers
sports	after reviewing some of the other devices to hold the ipod mini in place while exercising , selected the armband carrier . it more than adequately fills the bill of what i was looking for . occassionally , you might have to adjust the tension on the armband to keep it from slipping down your arm , but it holds the ipod firmly in place . it can cause some chaffing if you wear a sleeveless shirt if you walk or run with the device . if you sweat a great deal while you exercise , i would advise removing the ipod from the holder after you complete your routine . would recommend it to anyone who asks
sports	not worth the shipping cost . completely flawed . i ordered the oregon scientific , which is perfect . should be zero stars . dr. parha
sports	good machine - excellent price - purchase shipping but remember ! you got ta get on the thing and do the work
sports	allright , thuis gun is so much more than i was hoping for . its accurate , and its an incredible price . its pretty hard hitting . i was putting holes in a cardboad box from 50 feet away . im not new to airsoft , and i really wish that my first gun was as nice as this one if you take it out to have a little fight with your friends , i reccommend extra clips . the mag capacity is about 45 , and the load time is annoyingly long a very good gun for all abilitie
sports	i bought this hoping it would be a cheap and easy way to do crunches in the living room while watching tv ... i wondered how the thing worked since the pictures and blurb are less than descriptive . what it boils down to is that this is a `` foot hook '' tied to a bar with a nylon strap . the nylon strap is cheap and appears that it will wear quickly . the idea is you hook the bar under a closed door then do sit-ups/crunches ... the problem is that the nylon strap does n't actually hold your feet down . i wanted a product that would hold my feet down and allow me to use it in the middle of the room . negative on both accounts . you need a good sturdy door to implement this product , and then it still does n't truly hold your feet down . looks like i 'll break down and buy one of the bars that actually clamps to the bottom of a door to hold your feet down
sports	... for more than a couple of minutes ( no matter what i did ) and the toilet monster kept falling into the drink . overall it was quite underwhelming as a practical joke . i 've gotten much better results for the same money with other products
sports	i bought this sword on the 25'th of december . got it on the 27'th of december . paid for standard shipping . amazing delivery time ! the sword is amazing too ! thanks for the great product x-bows , i will be coming back to you soon
sports	i actually bought this for my husband . he loves it , it has a lot of great features . the only thing that we found was that you had to really wet the device in order to get it to read the heartrate .
sports	i was surprised when i received what appeared to be a sales brochure . i searched carefully through the shipping materials to see if i had missed the book entirely , but in fact the small , clumsily put together manual was in fact the $ 3.75 book that i bought online . it has some new exercises in it , but most of what we needed to know came with the therabands in the little manual that ships with them .
sports	i saw this design and thought it was a great idea . after using it twice my wrists still hurt . now i know why i could n't find this design at my local sporting goods store
sports	i bought this for my son ( recommended by his special ed teacher ) and the whole family has been using it ever since . it 's a nice , sturdy , trampoline and it 's not too expensive . the `` folding '' part is a little disappointing which i why it 's not getting full stars . however , we have n't needed to use that feature so it was n't that important to us . overall this is a good quality trampoline for those who are looking for something less expensive
sports	for the price , i should n't complain , but what the heck ? what ever happened to quality control ? it came double shrink wrapped . there was a plastic handle guard that did n't fit the sword , so i had to just throw it away . very little pride in the product . the wood was roughly sanded before it was painted . well , it 's just a stick afterall . i 'm just glad i did not purchase a more expensive item from this vendor , dreamobjects . read their feedback responses -- sounds a lot like aggressive ebay sellers who get their jollies replying to negative or lukewarm feedback . sorry -- waste of my time and a few dollars . i gave them a 4 out of 5 feedback simply because you ca n't tell quality from a single digital photo
sports	the ab roller was a big disappointment for me . it was more difficult to assemble because of shoddily constructed parts . then , once that project was done , i was unable to use it as the design is clearly for someone at least 4 or 5 inches taller than me . as a very petite ( 4'11 '' ) woman my hands barely reached the top bar , making it impossible for me to get the leverage to use the machine properly . so beware shorties out there
sports	i bought a sight from airsplat for my son 's airoft rifle as a christmas gift . the screws were too short to attach it to his kitty kat ( a shortened m-4 ) airsoft rifle 's weaver rail . yes , i could go out and find screws the proper length , but i though i 'd make airsplat do their job . so , after several e-mails with the service department , they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size . wrong . the diameter of the new screws is so big they wo n't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight . obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws . why by a gun from these guys ? if it arrives broken , you pay to ship it back . want a refund ? you pay a 15 % restocking fee . take a pass on airsplat .
sports	my friend and i both bought this gun . we both charged it for the recommended time and it never worked . i could throw bb 's with my toes faster than this if the gun worked on a good day . in ten minutes only 1 bb came out of the barrel and it just rolled out . it does n't work , 'nuff said . all it 's good for now is to be my back scratcher . buy a pack of bendy straws to shoot bb 's , they will work better than this gun . thank you for your time . good nigh
sports	the gloves looked great online but in actually , the quality of the product was not what i imagined . the gloves lacked padding on the inner hand and palm . instead , it had a thin sheet of nylon . the closure was not secure enough so i was able to slip my hand out even with it fastened on . on the bright side , the gloves were pretty and i had no problems returning the product back to amazon.com
sports	love this backpack , it 's been with me to numerous cities and countries and survives the trips very well , while protecting the contents well , laptop included . the outside large pocket is larger than you think when you realize just how much stuff you can fit in there , and still fit under an airplane seat . love the two water holders on the outside . love the zippers are a loop so you can attach a carabiner , compass , or whatever . the support is great , you 'll barely feel its there , and if you do , just use both straps , and then strap the front for great support . the pen storage area could be larger to accommodate larger pens , but thats quite minor . my only con is that the outside two pockets have gotten stuck twice already . i am now on my third backpack ( got ta love rei 's return policy ) . hopefully this one will last as i have yet to find a better more complete backpack . update 1/30/2007 - third backpack , third zipper to get caught , time to return , again . i wish i could change the scale down to 2 stars :
sports	i ordered this for my daughter when she played t-ball . she played on the cubs team and it was great . very durable , and adjustable
sports	this pair of pistols is quite entertaining . i have purchased quite a few airsoft guns in the last 6 months , and these are surprisingly the more powerful of what ive purchased . dualing spring pistols is a challenge , but there are ways to work the slide with 1 hand . they 're flimsy , but with enough care and responsibility theyll last a while . definitely worth 16 buck
sports	i just bought this product and it is sturdy and cheap . but there is not instruction manual on how to use the buttons or explain that stupid twist plate . what is it for , i can twist without it . anyway , 10 mins after using the machine i got a severe knee injury . i didnt have an injury before using it but i got one now . i am going to have to get rid of it .
sports	this bokken is only for looks and not hitting ant thing i used it for less than five mintues and broke . it has a nice look and feels good but does have blemishesand . also say if you accidentally hit something even a little hard it breaks . the company does a lousey job of wrapping the sword too . the barcode sticker failed to come off in one piece and i ended ripping off some of the finish of the burgundy version of this bokken . i spar with my friends all the time and would have to recommend the bokkens from karate depot instead of this inadequate piece of whatsit . anyone , honestly , that tells you differently is wrong
sports	i do n't think i have ever run across a more overpriced , flimsy piece of camping gear ; and for this very poorly engineered and built table to actually come from coleman was rather a shock . the first time i opened the box containing this table was while setting up the camp site . too late : the table was so delicate that the main parts that hold it together -- the leg anchors that support the equally flimsy and fragile aluminum cross pieces -- had been broken in the simple act of shipping . i looked closer , and these main supports were made of some incredibly cheap , delicate plastic . this thing would n't have lasted a day on a campsite , even if it had survived shipping ! ( we placed the table in the campsite 's trash dumper the next morning ) . buy a lower cost table from another company -- no need to even go to a higher priced unit , since anything else would be better designed and constructed than this table .
sports	i purchased this skateboard for my 7-year old daughter . her older brother is into rollerskating and she wanted to share in his activities , however , she did n't like the `` boy '' skateboards . she loves her new barbie skateboard
sports	this review will focus on the specs since there is minimal information available unless you buy the bike . first off , this is my second mongoose . i started out on a crappy low end cruiser model , so anything even half a step up from that model is a vast improvement . the theory weighs about 38 lbs and is actually light grey in color despite the image on this website . i thought i was getting a white bike , and i 'm a little ticked it 's actually grey , but , whateva . assembly is n't too bad as long as you have half a clue as to what you 're doing . the documentation is adequate , but do n't expect to be able to assemble this bike correctly if you have n't done it before . the documentation will frustrate you . but the average person can probably install the pedals and the saddle , and maybe even mount the handlbars correctly assuming the brakes do n't arrive screwed up like mine did . the front cable had to be relocated because when it was assembled at the plant , it was threaded immediately under the fork and the tire was rubbing against it so it had to be removed and resituated , which entailed messing with the front cable . simple enough , i suppose , but this assumes you know what you 're doing . i could n't install the front tire correctly because of the disc brake , and , wanting to be safe instead of stupid , i took the bike to an lbs and had them install it . it was then that i found out one of the disc pads was missing . no problem . i just went back home and found it in the box . apparently it had become dislodged from the housing on the front tire during transit . i did n't even know it was there because i have n't worked with disc pads before . it was a good thing i did n't toss the box right away otherwise i would have been sol . just be advised , however , that if you are missing one or both disc pads and do toss out the box before you realize one of the pads is missing , depending on where you are , you may or may not be able to find replacement pads . you may end up having to upgrade to a better brand disc brake . now onto the specs . the front disc brake is promax brand , dsk-400 , which in the world of mtn biking , is the generic low end . i had to do some digging around on the web to find the following site because you wo n't find a `` [ ... ] '' website . it was n't really all that much more helpful and did not help me to understand disc brakes any better , but at least you 'll have a better idea what to look for . the documentation on the site have color images vs the black and white images that come enclosed with the bike . go here instead : [ ... ] i would n't call the promax disc brake crap , but , close enough . note : if you plan on doing any kind of semi-serious mtn biking , as in on a trail considered `` intermediate '' level , then upgrade the disc brakes . and if you 're planning a real mtn biking trip with rocks and logs and the whole nine , then the theory can probably handle it , just do n't expect miracles . as to the gears , there are 21 shimano flavored and they work flawlessly . they 're a pleasure to have because there is n't the usual slipping and dragging you see on lower end mongoose mtn bikes . the only problem i had was the upper gears do n't seem to want to shift into any gear definitely unless you downshift say , to 2 , then upshift to 3 , for example , and so forth for the others . if you want 6 , then go to 5 , then upshift and vice versa . this may or may not be because the cogs need to be lubed . as to the ride , the theory is a dual-suspension bike and you can really feel the difference vs a hard-tail bike . wow . just riding on the street and going over speed bumps and rain gulleys is amazing . you have very little to no shock at all because the suspension absorbs it . overall , this bike is good bang for the buck , but i would n't pay over $ 300.00 tops for it . if you 're going to go that high , you can get something else with higher end parts . oh , one last thing . if you value your reproductive organs , and do n't want to find yourself numb from package to exit and/or sitting on a bag of frozen peas for a week after using the bike , then do yourself a favor and switch out the saddle . the one that comes with the theory is horrible . get a thicker padded , gel lined , split saddle instead .
sports	i recieved umbrella from unclesams umbrella shop of n.y. , then returned it as it was too big . i have never recieved a refund of over $ 25.00 . i would like to know what happened and when i will get my money back . umbrella was picked up by ups on 03/07/05 . i can be reached at : vlb47 @ earthlink.net i look forward to a resolution to this problem . thank you , vick
sports	we opened 2 razor bumper buggy 's for hanukkah that we got as gifts from a family member . both of them were missing the charger for the battery ( and other hardware ) , so our kids could n't even play with them . they were very disappointed . what is worse , razor 's customer service is terrible ! they would not send us the missing chargers without a receipt . of course , since they were gifts , we did n't have the reciept . razor refused to help us until we could get proof of purchase from a credit card statement , which wo n't be for a couple of weeks . then of course it will take a couple more weeks to actually get the chargers . all this hassle , all the hours on the phone , when they could have just sent us the missing chargers , like any decent company would for such a high price item ! our poor kids , just looking at their motionless bumper cars . of course , we ca n't actually review whether the prodcut is any good or not until sometime in februrary when we actually get to use it . happy hanukkah to you too , razor
sports	we just got it , i first gave it a 60 second shake and it worked fine , and i let it sit for a day and a half . it lit up again without shaking so the capacitor holds the energy a very long time . shaking it for over a minute continuosly gave me a bright shine that lasts pretty long . we are in the caribbean with literally no electricity most of the time without even moonlight . this works perfectly .
sports	this product was constructed better than the one i use at the gym . it is very heavy duty and has lots of padding . it is comfortable for both myself and my husband to use .
sports	thanx for the great mat ! i hope to become a better golfer because of it
sports	we bought this trainer over 4 monhs ago from a local fitness store . from the beginning the heart rate programs never worked properly . i train using a heart rate monitor so i can follow my heart rate during excercise , if we tried to use the schwinn 's 418 's hr programs it read anywhere from 40 to 60 bpm too low ! ! ! , what that meant is that the machine kept on increasing the resistance thinking my wife or myself were cruising along at a nice 99 bpm when we were going aerobic at over 150 ! ! ! . not only is that dangerous , especially for someone who never trained before , but it made 30 % of the machines functions unusable . add a display that 's hard to read , controls that are anything but logical , and this unit is a loser , no matter what consumer reports says . on top of that spare parts took forever to get delivered , and when they arrived , the machine still malfunctioned . the only thing good out of our experiance was the sales person who worked with us to exchange the schwinn for a better trainer from another company . bottom line , stay away from the schwinn 418 , there 's a reason schwinn only put a sx month warranty on labor and electronics , they knew this machine is worthless , do n't you find out the hard way
sports	may be okay if you take it to a climate controlled office , but not much good as an outdoors job food jar .
sports	these seats , while they are as nice as they look , do not fit into a `` seat '' at the stadium , rendering them useless ! they take up 1.25 seats per , and if you are at a sold out game you will not be able to use them , especially if you have 2 . they need to make them a few inches smaller
sports	i just got the sword and i liked it but i thought that it was a little small . then the sword broke from its hilt on the third day that i had it ! ! ! ! ! now you might think that i was doing careless things to it but i just swung it a few times slowly in the air and i realized that the sword wa n't on there very good . after that i was just swinging it slowly around the house and it just fell off . so do n't buy the sword if you going to do anything but look at it
sports	the product is well made , and a great idea for travel without a mat . however , i bought it so i would slip less in my postures once i started sweating . however , although the paws do n't slip on the floor surface , your skin slips out of them when you sweat , making them worthless . guess i will stick with having a towel around !
sports	i bought one of these for friends that have children , and one for a friend who is married without children . they all seemed to love it !
sports	my daughter got these at 6 years old and she loves them . she learned how to move about on them although a year later she 's still quite wobbly . the shoes still look pretty new after a lot of use . my problem is that there really is no way for her to stop . no knob brake like normal skates have , so most of the time she 's pretty out of control or walking like frankenstein . also , the button to pop the wheels in and out is very difficult for her to push on her own , so we have to dot it for her . it was n't like that when i first bought it , though . we bought her normal skates for christmas to replace these .
sports	this is a great helmet . my daughter has been very happy with it and loves to wear it
sports	deep gouges caused by feet of sofa where all finish was off in 2 6 '' x9 '' areas were discovered during move-out ; this product saved us from complete refinishing of otherwise gorgeous oak floors . simply rubbed the felt-like stick over the area , and the gouges seemed to `` fill in '' ! applied 2 more layers , and were amazed ! could n't tell where they were .
sports	the display is pretty much perfect , but as a display it is supposed to keep balls facing forward . a litte bump inside holders allow balls to move
sports	i used to have ddr for xbox and when my xbox broke on me , i decided not to spend the money on a new one . however , i missed my ddr workouts everyday so i bought this as a replacement . i should have spent the money on a new xbox . this product is not worthy of having the name ddr on the box . imagine a dance pad game for atari . then imagine it is the worst possible atari game you have ever seen , and that would be a close description of this game . there are 50 computer generated `` beeping '' monphonic sounds that irritate more than energize you . the rythem and the timing is off on all the songs , and the dance pad is very poor quality . it was n't even worth the cost of the shipping to have it delivered to my home . i wish i had sent it back without opening it . now i 'm stuck with a game that even the pawn shop will not take .
sports	one has to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of this product based on one 's needs or requirements . imo , the pros and cons are ... pros : these tabs weigh only a few ounces , but can treat up to 20 liters . they are very effective at killing off viruses , bacteria , giardia , and cryptosporidium ( epa accepted ) . this product is great if you ca n't build a fire or boil water . cons : one tab for one liter so unless you stock up , you can only support one person for 5 days if you use 1 gal . or 4 liters per day for roughly $ 10 . compare this to 96oz ( ~56000 drops ) of clorox for $ 4 and it only takes 16 drops to treat 1gal . of water . katadyn claims that their tabs leave virtually no taste to the water , but i disagree . there is a very strange taste in the water that is less tolerable than chlorine imo . minimum treatment time is 30 minutes for both . alternative : boil water for 5 minutes at any desired quantity at virtually no cost ! :
sports	i am the captain of a walking team and i purchased several of these pedometers as incentives for my team members . i wore my pedometer before giving the rest out just to test it . on the very first day , the pedometer lost count of my steps on three occasions , and by the end of the day , one of the buttons had fallen off . i do not feel comfortable giving these pedometers to my walkers . i should have invested a little more money per item to get the best value for my money
sports	i bought the x-lander because i am a pilot and wanted a bit more information when i needed it . the watch is well designed and of good quality . a few things did disappoint me , but i think they are outweighed by the features , however . - it appears that it does not have a second time zone . why they would not include this is beyond me . as a pilot i want local time in 12hour format and zulu time in 24hr format . a traveler would want time here and at home . it is not there , but is on other models they offer . - the dial is not the easiest to read and i had to use a magnifier to see the units information on setup such as feet vs. meters and celsius vs. farenheit . the display needs to be more vivid . the company does offer a white face with black numerals , which might be better . it is a nice watch , but not the greatest execution of the concept , especially for $ 300
sports	if your toes get hot it has a zipper for that . ( useless ) better off getting a rectangular if you need more legroom . its small ( even the long one ) for a big guy . i wouldnt use it for anything but the summer ( and you will most definatly need a good pad
sports	if you study pilates then you will see how the performers do not have the proper body positions . one of the girls keeps staring at the camera for no reason and moving her body when it should be still . as a lover of pilates and how much it has done for me , i urge you to buy something else
sports	the dials/gages appear to be very good quality and look very nice . they are very accurate as far as i can tell in comparing them to my lacross clock/weather gage and the local weather reports and web reports . the hygrometer may be off by 2 % but am not convinced this is true as yet and i can adjust it . i set the barometer to +1.1 '' for my 1050 ' above sea level . i wish the clock was not a loud tick tick tick . it is not that bad , but i would rather not have that at all as my ears very easily pick up on things like that . the one thing i do not like is that i should have checked the dimensions of it . i am not sure if they were listed when i bought it . so check the size of what you think you life before you purchase . this one seems a little small . not the gages but the mounting board . it could be a little wider and a little taller . i also , somehow messed up on buying one that had such a boring mounting board . i would have liked a beveled arch on the top or such . the wood is good quality and the varnish appears to be top notch . i do n't mark down for this . i mark down for the size of the mounting overal as it could be taller and wider . not buy much , but maybe an inch wider and 2 ' taller . overal i like it alot . i just did not realize how plane jane it was in mounting and size .
sports	one of the worst ! the braces that secure the material and the tent together broke ! after taking it down we noticed cracks in the rods . when i went to set it up the second time one was split end to end and another snapped . it sits on our from curb for garbage as i write this review
sports	i woke up repeatedly in the night with more pain that the plantars faciitis was giving me for the following reasons : -the front part of the sock device is extremely narrow . i do n't have wide feet , but the pointy ends crowded by toes and caused cramps that i had to adjust for constantly . could never get used to it . -the strap around the ankle was too stiff and chaffed . took forever to find the right tightness that did n't cause my feet to swell painfully in the night while not being so loose that it moved and chafed horribly . -honestly , even wearing a hard plastic brace was easier for me to sleep with . a simple strap that supported the arch and wrapped over the instep has been the most effective , along with faithfully wearing the arch supports during the day . do n't waste your money
sports	this is a nice bag with a fatal flaw . the major zippers break very easily . after my first bag broke within a few months , amazon kindly provided a free replacement . deja vu ensued . for a few extra dollars , delta could use more robust zippers -- they really should .
sports	is it squeeky ? yes . but i did n't mind . what i did mind was the fact that the tether which acts as a pully broke about a year into its use . i did n't use it vigorously , and i 'm only 160 lbs . i 'd say avoid
sports	my husband and his friend likes to hike and one day he and his friend met some people out of state -- they wanted to share email address -- -no one had a pen/pencil so my husband 's friend pulls out his pocket knife and inside it is a pen to write with . everyone was so excited to know there is a swiss army signature with a pen to write with inside . my husband looked everyone where in stores for this same knife set cause he wanted one just like it -- -could not find it so i did some searching on the net and bought it for his christmas gift -- -he was so excited to receive it on christmas morning . thanks
sports	received the order in a timely fashion however , the box was badly i mean badly damaged . it was a birthday gift for a family member . i always order early , mistake , returns are 30 days . we had the party 45 days later when we opened the box rust went on the carpet did you ever try to get rust out of off- white carpeting . to make things even worse it was missing all the hardware for putting it together . probably fell out of the hole in the box that was there before they shipped it to me . happy birthday ! ! ! ! ! ! and your welcome for the carpet stain , all new things come rusty , you did n't know that
sports	the following were the problems : 1 . bent fender - poor packaging 2 . sratches in paint in several areas 3 . three nuts were missing 4 . the front wheel hub had lateral play - can not be fixed planning to return cycle if amazon accepts it
sports	i have been looking for nice ti set for camping , and finally found it in amazon at very cheap price ! the ti set is really light and good for backpackers . unfortunately , i found one my of set ( i bought 2 sets ) got manufacturing defects , the fork is bent at a smaller angle , which looks quite weird when i stack them together . hope brunton should do better qa on their products . apart from this , the ti set is quite nice ! but buy with your own risk ( you never know the angle problem if you buy 1 set only ! )
sports	this is the second nike watch i ordered . the first one did not work and isent it back to amazon . amazon was great and sent me new one . this one worked for a few days . i then had the battery replaced . two weeks after it stopped working . by that time i had thrown out the box etc and now it is sitting in the basket in my kitchen . i have hopes to return it but it seems to much of a problem to explain . i am am glad i have had this opportunity to vent . in short , the watch is awful .
sports	wow ! i was really pleased with my purchase . i 've never owned a heavy bag before so i did n't know what to expect . i just started martial arts so i wanted a bag to practice on , but i did n't have a lot of money to spend . this purchase was not only well within my price range , but the bag is high quality and includes a speed bag with gloves ! the gloves are n't very padded , a boxer friend of mine told me the gloves included were really for use on the speed bag . the heavy bag comes filled and is very solid , the chain is heavy duty , and the connections for the chain on the bag are well attached with double stitching . i was a little uncertain about just what the nevatear material was , now i know . my description would be a heavy duty nylon with a slight rubberized feeling . in my opinion better than the abrasive canvas bags , yet not as soft to the touch as a leather bag . two other purchases i would recommend are a good set of padded gloves for use on the heavy bag ( i purchased some padded grappling gloves ) and for the speed bag you will need two things : ( 1 ) a swivel attachement ( i bought the everlast plastic ball swivel for about $ 15 at a local academy sports store ) and ( 2 ) you will need to make or purchase a backboard and stand or wall attachment ( i made mine from 2 x 6 's and 3/4 '' mdf ) . all in all , a great purchase ! i could n't be happier
sports	i hate to feed into the mentality that causes knifemakers to hype their blades as `` tactical , '' because the last thing we need to give lawmakers is another excuse to heroically protect us by banning the tools we carry . but the first and last thing i have to say about the ken onion tactical blur is that it is one fearsome knife . a curved blade would be suited to your usual cutting and slicing applications , such as skinning mastodons and so on . this knife , on the other hand , has a chisel-like tanto point , which is ideal for thrusting effortlessly through beef ribs or car hoods . it would be equally at home cutting up cardboard boxes , linoleum flooring , or metal garbage cans . technically , this is n't a switchblade . switchblades are bad . we know this because our lawmakers have heroically protected us by effectively banning them at various levels . this is only an ordinary liner-lock knife with spring-assisted opening . but if i ever found a switchblade with the deployment speed and cutting power of the blur , i 'd say it was quite a knife . the blade is shaving-sharp from the factory , and the handle is lightweight but sturdy aluminum with some kind of gritty sandpaper-like stuff glued on to give a better grip should the knife become slippery with any sort of fluid . use your imagination . i have n't tried shattering any cinderblocks with it yet , but it 's sturdy enough to use as a yawara stick in a pinch . folded , the whole package can be palmed even in my small hands and feels much like a disposable lighter with a glandular problem . i do n't even notice it in my hip pocket , which is where it rides whenever i happen to be wearing pants . if walking around with something this fearsome seems too naughty for you , remember a couple of things . one is that you can buy it from the wall for $ 55 , and the wall would not sell naughty things to naughty people . another is that crimes , to my knowledge , are not generally committed with knives like these , but with such evil implements as kitchen knives , screwdrivers , and whatever happens to be lying around near the crime scene . lastly , you will probably not need a knife this fast and ferocious , but if you do , you will *really* need it . and you 'll have it
sports	me and a friend bought 2 of these . they look really cool . however they are not sharp at all ( hence only 4 stars ) . for $ 15 they are really good value though . the hilt is plastic and the blade is a little thin . other than that they are quite good .
sports	i bought this croquet set late last summer for backyard get-togethers with the neighbors . none of us had played before , so we did n't need top-of-the-line , and the price was right on this set . it 's everything it needs to be : weighty , colorful , and compact in its case . the widgets are pretty bendy , but if they bend out of shape , they bend right back . turned out to be a good investment . a word of warning if you have small dogs : put them in the house before you let your neighbors loose with mallets and round projectiles . my little dachshund picked up the bad habit of chasing the balls and pushing them further off-course . it was funny , until she darted into the path of one bright orange ball , which made solid contact with her little head . ( she 's fine now , but is no longer a fan of the game . ) all in all , i would highly recommend having a set like this around if you have the room in your backyard and fun neighbors
sports	i bought this for my son who is 4 . he loves it and can operate it whith out any help . good quality and can take alot of abuse
sports	the drishti yoga strap is just great ! i 've tried a lot of straps in my time practicing yoga . ( several different studios , borrowed friends ' , etc . ) this one is excellent . it 's 2 feet longer than standards straps , but it 's offered at the same price as standard straps - what a deal ! it 's also thick and sturdy . i would certainly recommend this product
sports	***** this is an upscale designer water bottle , top of the line , and so much fun . the designs of sigg 's water bottles are gorgeous , from the plain , solid color bottles , to the ones with intricate designs . they are simply beautiful ! i switched from regular plastic water bottles because of health concerns , thinking it would take more work to maintain . these do necessitate regular cleaning ( i clean mine every day ) , but having something so beautiful to drink from makes the cleaning fun . sort of like my rings , glasses , and watch , i now consider my sigg personal water bottle a vital accessory , reminding me to drink more water , making a statement about my values , and expressing myself with a special design . yes , all in a water bottle ! sigg of switzerland water bottles are very high quality , made of light aluminum on the outside , slightly insulated , and covered with a special powder coat on the inside that prevents any leaching whatsoever , unlike plastic and polycarbonate water bottles . they are light , durable , and perfect for any activity . well water tastes spectacular in these bottles , just like from the tap . sigg bottles come with several different types of tops . i bought the screw top because i do n't like sports tops , and i do n't mind unscrewing the top when i want a drink . it is totally leakproof , which is important to me . the top is pretty and can be hooked onto a carabiner . i get comments on it all the time , `` what 's that ? i love it ! '' the sports top version is ok ; i just am not a fan , as i do n't feel like i can get enough water from the little stream from the sports top . however , for convenience , you might prefer it . for children , there is a cap-type top . all are leak-proof . if you are ever unsatisfied with the top , you can buy a screw top separately to fit your sigg bottle . sigg makes their personal water bottle in .6l and 1l in this style . i have both . i use the .6l for sports activities because they are smaller . when i wo n't have to carry the container , i like the larger bottle . sigg also makes a smaller .3l bottle for children that is a perfect size for young people . you can buy siggs in alternative sizes too , such as .75l , .4l ( for kids ) , .6l , .5l . you can occasionally find this bottle in the 1.5l size , also . search amazon for the perfect size . pick a style and pattern you like , as this bottle is a personal accessory , and should reflect your style . the colors are vibrant and even prettier than they seem in the pictures on amazon . they are expensive , but they are so durable that you can plan on them lasting many years . i consider them both an accessory and an investment in my health , so they are well worth it value-wise for me . highly recommended . ****
sports	does not work like advertised . ball falls way to low and right next to the pole way before you can hit it again . it may also damage a wood or aluminum bat . last time i buy anything before reading the reviews on amazon .
sports	this is my 4th pair of aqua fitness gloves , my 2nd pair of this exact speedo aqua fitness glove . allowing the fingers to protrude through the ends of the gloves is a great benefit . with other gloves , water builds up inside the glove and , if lycra-backed for example , the glove becomes like a big balloon after a short while . these speedo gloves allow the water to pass through the glove and out the finger-holes . in addition , the material the gloves are made of is much sturdier than other gloves i have had . the palms hold up well as do the backs . i recommend these gloves and will always use them in my water fitness exercises
sports	i ordered the pogo roo pogo stick on dec. 6 , 2006 and i am still waiting for it to be shipped . they just bumped it back another month to mid may for delivery and yet if you go to the web site it says it is in stock . best of luck to anyone who wants it within 6 months ! very poor service
sports	i really like the heart rate monitor and it works great . as has been said , it takes some time learning all it does , but it 's worth it in my opinion . the only thing i was not real excited about was the pace jumps around quite a bit , but from what i have been told by others and their brands of running watches , they all do this to an extent . everything else i 'm quite happy with and would highly recommend it to anyone . the distance reading has been right on the money after calibration .
sports	we registered for two of these mobiles for our twins . we recieved both of them . upon putting them together , we realized that the mobile ca n't operate without the pieces hitting the bar that holds it to the crib ! how annoying ! we returned them both
sports	hey , i decided to review some things i did n't buy off amazon , but i have owned for sometime that are really great items : the kind i would buy again for sure if they were lost . i would say lost or broken , but jansport has lifetime warranties ! if anything happens to your backpack , all you have to do is mail it to jansport with a note of the problem , they will fix it for free and send it back to you . they will even send you a card while they have it telling you it misses you and will be back soon . overall , these are such great products , you just have to get a jansport if you 're thinking of a backpack . also , i am in a review writing competition with a friend of mine and if this review is helpful , which i hope it really is , i would love to have your yes vote ! with care , sa
sports	this chin up bar works well . i 'm 160lbs and it holds me with ease . great addition to any other home gym equipment , or if your on the road and need to work out in your hotel room or whatnot
sports	this item is a piece of junk . all you get is smudges and black marks . it does not work . buy your balls already labeled or get a better stamper . just please do n't buy this thing
sports	this rack works perfect for me . it as easy to assemble and its easy to use . it folds up to put in the corner of the garage when not in use . my bikes have curved cross bars , so this mounting style was my only option , and it works great
sports	if you order this sword , you may not get what you see . yes you will get the same 'style ' of sword , but as for the look , forget it , the steel is pure black . now if that 's what you want great , i personally wanted the 'silver ' steel look , but got the 'jet black ' steel . do n't worry , it was the same sword , just a different color .
sports	i ordered the schwinn 203 just a week ago . it was eligible for free delivery and i took advantage of that offer . it stated that it would take extra time for delivery , however it arrived within a week . though several have stated it was difficult to put together and took several hours my highly non-mechanical wife and i had it together in about an hour and fifteen minutes . the directions are a bit tricky but knowing that in advance from the other reviews helped . once we were finished assembling it i got on it and started it up and began peddling . i was sure it was not working correctly becuase there was absolutely no sound at all -- mechanical or otherwise . i then reached over and increased the resistance and found out it was working correctly . my wife and i both use it and love it . i am 325 pounds and it works great for me and based on several nights of extreme sweating during my workouts i do n't expect to be 325 for long . super bike ! ! very pleased ... besides this is what my knee surgeon suggested for rehabilitating a knee i torn up last year and it 's doing fine
sports	my box arrived somewhat banged up , but apart from a cosmetic scuff on one handlebar , it was ok . but , after 2 days i started hearing a noise , seemed to come from the interior of the pedals/gearbox , sounded like a loose object bouncing around . i was afraid i would have to ship it back . i called schwinn , and the woman asked me to take the pedals off and see if i could reproduce the sound . i assured her , it was not the pedals . she said , `` yes sir , now please take the pedals off '' . i did , and , it was the left pedal ! sounded just like the interior . anyway , they will send me new pedals , so problem solved . sounds like they have encountered this problem before . also , i was frustrated by the inability to see the blue display screen , so i bought 2 doorstops , removed the standard mounting screws , and used `` goop '' adhesive to make the screen lean forward . now i can read it ! someone at scwinn did not do the q.c . on that screen issue . anyway , great bike , now i 'm happy .
sports	my 24 month old son loves this bike - it was fairly easy to put together , and works well . thanks
sports	on the basis of the first review here , i ordered this bike and could n't be happier with it . this is the first piece of exercise equipment i 've ever tried that is worth the space it takes up . i use it every day
sports	while this rack looks good , and appears well constructed , it 's mounting system leaves something to be desired . while attempting to lock this unit down tight enough to keep it from constantly twisting around , i managed to bend the locking lever . now do n't get me wrong , this is mounted on my wife 's bike ( a cruiser ) and has had at most 10 lbs of groceries in the handy basket you can purchase that slides right on . but having to stop every so often to straighten this thing out is quite annoying . i suppose i will end up modifying the locking mechanism to avoid further aggravation . by the way , i have a delta rear rack on my atb that mounts to the seat post using a 4 bolt clamp . much sturdier , and it was much less expensive , as well
sports	when i was assembling this product i discovered that not only were the instructions vague , and that the product pictured did not appropriately match the product given , but that the product itself was sloppily manufactured . the predrilled holes were only half the depths that the instructions required them to be in order to properly assemble and adjust the final height . my thought is ... how hard is it to drill a hole to a proper depth ? luckily i own the tools necessary to fix their mistakes , but how much money are they really saving by inconveniencing their customers ? i wish i could give this product a higher rating , but hopefully there are better alternatives
sports	the ball is good overall . one big issue , however , is that it picks up dirt quickly and becomes slippery to the hands then . you 'll notice this well as your hands become dirty after using the ball for sometime . yeah , i used it on a indoor wooden court : -
sports	i bought this helmet for my 3 year old . he likes it , it seems to fit well , seems to adjust fairly easily , received good reviews from consumer reports . the only thing i do n't like about it is the chin straps seem to twist a little bit between the ears and chin . my son has n't complained about this being uncomfortable , but it looks like it might possibly be . i ca n't see any way to straighten them out all the way from ears to chin , it 's just the way they are attached to the helmet . generally though , i am very happy with it . oh , another thing , in the photo , the helmet looks almost red , white , and blue . it 's really dark gray and black . i think the photo does n't show this actual helmet but the design ( style and stars ) are the same
sports	on the advice of my chiropractor , i decided to buy an inversion table , but did n't want to spend a lot of money because i feared it would be yet another piece of equipment that would end up collecting dust in my spare room , along with my rowing machine and exercise bike . so i purchased this calm system because it was inexpensive and i figured i could sell it or send it back if i ended up not using it . well , so far i and my spouse have found it to be very good for relieving back pain , and best of all you do n't have to spend a lot of time on the machine . about 3 or 4 minutes a couple of times a day is all it takes to relieve lower back spasms and stretch out the spine . also , the machine is quite light weight and easily folds to shove in a closet or behind a wall unit . overall , i am pleasantly surprised and would recommend this system . there is no need to spend a lot of money in order to experience the benefits of inversion therapy
sports	i did n't want to invest a lot of money in an exercise bike as i plan to use it while recovering from surgery . this one seemed to be pretty well rated and the price was very reasonable . it does the job , but only just . i 've had it for about 2 months and the monitoring device has stopped working reliably . sometimes it tracks speed/distance/calories/time and sometimes it just wo n't come on . at first it worked great . also , the seat is not very stable and is a bit wobbly . not in danger of falling off or anything , but just not a secure connection to the base . overall , the bike works about as well as you would expect one for this price to work , but i did hope for better quality
sports	great item but really too large for 3 year olds . maybe good for 5 or older .
sports	i just received this toy today in the mail and it was a total bust . i gave it to my 14 month old daughter and she handed it back to me . they legs that are supposed to make the music are hard to push and she can not do it herself . i only paid 5.29 for it with free shipping so i ca n't complain . at least my 3 month old likes to look at it . i would not recommend buying this toy
sports	the console that came with mine is broken ... so i have n't been able to use it . i have been told by the customer support people @ schwinn/bowflex - since the middle of february - that a replacement is on it 's way ( even the `` supervisor '' said this to me ) . hear that ticking ? yeah , that 's the clock on my warranty - it is just going away without ever even getting a chance to try the thing out . am i happy ... no ! ! maybe i 'll write another review when i get my new console and i can tell you how wonderful this piece of equipment is - until then - i 'm one heck of a ticked off customer . save yourself the headache and just go to the gym
sports	i purchased three of these units to mount in a utility trailer . they did a great job on the trip of holding our bikes rock steady . very easy to get the bikes in and out of . great product
sports	we researched for a secure and good value inversion table and decided to buy this model . this is a very low price for such a good quality inversion table . the ankles are comfy and secure . the dvd shows how to incline gradually and adjust it just right . as you assemble it you can notice that there is little room for something to go wrong from its good engineering design . the best part is using it . it feels so good to feel your spine expanding and blood flowing to new areas . i ca n't wait to use it again . we love it .
sports	mine is blackened , scratched , dented and i do n't even carry the insides any more , but i love it . this is usually the only cooking pot i carry backpacking because so much of our cooking anymore involves boiling water . the wide mouth is perfect for scooping up water or snow . i think it 's part bucket . this is the one
sports	my buddy died wearing this mask . well he did n't die but he lost his eye . the mask got hit in the mesh and broke and all in his eye .
sports	i purchased 3 of these for a very old bike with no holes to mount a water bottle . one of them worked perfect , snug fit and everything worked . the other 2 had nuts that were too large to fit in the plastic . this is my second , and last purchase from zefal , i was happy it wasnt made in china ... but i guess the french dont believe in good quality merchandis
sports	positive : -size , good surface area -chipping net negatives : -poor instructions -very hard to set up by yourself . really takes 2 people , because nothing fits tight , so as you try to get one side in , the other side pops out . -nothing locks in . plastic caps to hold rear poles do n't fit tightly . the 'male ' sticks that go into the 'female ' section of the rear poles are not tight , so a wind from the rear pushes it over . i have had to make some modifications to this item to make it usable . i taped some eyelets to the bottom of the rear poles and attached to ring with caribiners . i 've had to tape the caps onto the top of the rear poles and add some tape to the ends of the front pole to make it snug
sports	my husband is an airline pilot , and since they took away his crew meals he needs meal replacements . there frequently is not enough time between flights to grab a bight to eat in the airports . this is his favorite flavor and often the hardest to find in the store . thanks for offering these by the case
sports	we 've gone through about 2 or 3 generations of infusion basketballs from spalding . the gimmick is n't worth it and there are better balls like the original zi/o and the excel for outdoor and the tf1000 for indoor
sports	i 'm a big fan of topeak 's gear . i own two of their racks , couple of pumps , bags , etc . i use the mtx trunk bag/panniers to commute , and i live in florida so i needed rain cover . i purchased this , and to my surprise -- -- topeak failed to include a strap for a rear blinkie . yes , the cover is yellow . yes , there 's a reflective triangle . but that 's not the same as a blinkie . gee , topeak , do you think people might want to run a blinkie in the rain ? stupid lack of planning .
sports	i love the workout dvd that comes with it - but the ball developed a slow leak after only a few uses . very disappointed with this product
sports	not very bright for an led . and , guess what ? this is about 2 1/2 inches long if it is standing on its tippy-toes ! given the picture shows a spike on it , one could have the impression that it is big enough to spike into the ground and mark a trail or something ... well , the spike is more like a thumbtack . i realize the images are provided by the manufacturer , so i do n't blame amazon - but there is no excuse for not accurately listing the actual size of this .
sports	this is the best ab workout machines i have ever bought ... and it works ! i had no problem with the shipping or the actual product
sports	pros : 1.great compartmentalization everything is easy to obtain ( if you know where to put it ) . 2.lots of room able to put just about everything in it . gym clothes , several text books , laptop , camping gear , etc . cons : 1.its bulky , even when nothing is in it , its bulky . if your one who likes to show off your back or want a sense of style this is not the product for you . tip : to make less bulky , put more stuff in bigger compartments relative to smaller compartment . 2 . the shoulder strap strain resistant does n't quite work ... i 'm consider myself an average male , strain works in about 25lbs . if you want less strain i 'd go for the targus or wenger brands . conclusion : if all you want is lots of space to put ur stuff w/o the style involved this product is for you
sports	more of a novelty than a useful flashlight . need to shake it a lot to get a charge and even then the emitted light is too low to be useful . the switch has also broken and we havent even used the flashlight more than a couple times ... would not recommend buying this flashlight , trying to return mine .
sports	when the scope arrived , it came slightly cracked on the end you look through , which was n't a good start . then , when i looked through , there was no magnification , just small red crosshairs . if you are looking for a functioning scope , do not buy this scope . but if ur looking to decorate your gun , then this looks pretty cool on it
sports	i recieved the arachnid electronic dart board and it looked very cheap . the numbers looked like a child put stickers around the board . the entire left half of the board would not register that those numbers were hit by the darts . i bought a different dart board from walmart that was cheaper and way nicer .
sports	i was extremely disappointed in this item . i think it is a good concept , but it does n't work well at all . it says on the back that you have to take big sips for it to register that you are really drinking it . i tried to really take big sips and it would barely register that i drank anything . it is awkward to drink from too . i can not believe this thing was really tested out by people before it went on the market . not worth buying . just buy a regular water bottle for a fraction of the cost and save yourself the aggravation
sports	i gave this product one star because it was the lowest option . what i really give it is this : warning ! the outback hitchback 4 product is a dangerous piece of junk . i installed it on my suburban ( which required the - needs to be redesigned - adaptor to 2 inch ) and put one full-sized and three kid bikes on it . it swayed a range of 10-12 inches newly installed . my wife had went on the target web site earlier and read that the sway was normal . by the time i had traveled 1/3 of the way back to the bay area from laketahoe ( in the middle of the night ) i noticed in the lights of the car behind me the hub of the full sized bike wheel sticking out from the side of the vehicle . i pulled over in the dark and checked it out . due to the constant side-to-side motion of the winding mountain roads the main metal braket had bent and the sway had increased to a now dangerous 2 feet ! needless to say the rest of the four hour trip was nerve racking . roping the rack to try and stabilize it . i 'm taking the rack back to target
sports	this compass fails to do the one simple task i purchased it for , which is simply telling me which direction i am going . i spent $ [ ... ] for a [ ... ] compass made out of crap materials . it works only for the direction you set it at . for example if you set it while facing north , it will be correct when you go north- but if you change directions , the result is completely random ... . this compass only works for one direction- and therefore it is utterly useless for a car situation where you actually ( gasp ) might turn . absolute rippoff .
sports	works well . much faster than the `` cheap '' metal swivel that has only the hook . if you do n't have a wealth of speed-bag experience , be prepared to `` re-learn '' when you upgrade to this swivel
sports	three of these broke . granted the company sent me two replacements for nothing after the first one failed , but to no avail . my wife received something similar from spri ( doctor 's tubing ) and it has lasted for a few years now
sports	i 'm very happy with the craftsmanship of the swoard and the delivery service . the exactness of the finish and , the wrap was done with every bit of care as a swoard made of metal . my son was also very happy with the workmanship and quality when he opened it on christmas . thanks everyone , g. hanso
sports	being a bodybuilder , i hoist heavy weights all the time ; a major stress especially when it comes to squats . i ordered the boots when i realized i had shrunk to 5'10.5 '' from being 6'0.5 '' . i was thusly very happy when after approximately 5 weeks of hanging ( 5 times a week , 10-15 min intervals ) that i am nearly back to my original height ( 6 ' 0.25 '' ) . i highly suggest this product as a supplement to good [ emphasis on good ] chiropractic care . to those who have/will order this product , do n't be discouraged if it seems to hurt your back at first ; that 's totally normal because your back is trying to readjust while the discs [ which cushion the vertebrate ] start rehydrating . also , it will take some time to find the strap tightness that 's right for your legs . generally , tighter on the top strap and looser on the bottom is a good combination . p.s . hang from a real pull-up bar and make sure you have someone to spot you if you are not strong enough to pull yourself back up the bar to unlatch yourself .
sports	i agree that this is hands-down the best water bottle on the market . take a regular water bottle and add a flip-up bite valve that prevents leaks ( just like on camelbak hydration backpacks ) . the bottle also includes a removeable straw so you can drink without having to turn the bottle upside down . my only criticism is that the bottle is hard plastic and may break more easily than the soft plastic water bottles that you can buy elswhere . however , the lid is a standard size and will fit on most other water bottles . thus , by combining the lid from this bottle with other water bottles , you can get the best of both worlds . also , it would be nice if the bottle had an insulation option , so as to prevent condensation from forming on the outside of the bottle
sports	i wanted to order the puzzle sports mats but they do not tell you how many you get with your order . i also tried the company web site and could not fine info there .
sports	i do n't really write reviews , but i felt like i needed to say something about this one . maybe its me , but i could n't get the pump to work . so i bought a new basketball . i bought a regular one , and bought a pump . i wish that infusion thing worked out , because it would have been great to deflate it , put it in my bag , and then pump it up again at the court . but my friend warned me they do n't work so good . i 'm just stubborn i guess . that 's my 2 cents . take it for what its worth
sports	i ordered two of these to save on shipping and figured the extra tube would be good for relube in another year or two . after applying one vial , it seemed even worse than before . ( tread `` catches '' as i walk . ) so i applied the second vial just to make it usuable . ( still not great . ) this stuff is overpriced and either they do n't give you enough or it 's poor quality
sports	the thule sidekick was the perfect size - not too big , not too small . it did not appear clunky-big on top of the car , nor was it too small to fit anything in . the assembly was a snap ( did it with only one person - no problem ) . it withstood freeway speeds in oregon rain without even letting a drop of moisture into the box . highly recommended
sports	the way these bags are constructed - or supposed to be - is that they are stuffed with fibers , and filled with sand , for weight , at the bottom - the part you do n't punch . i was wondering why it felt like i was punching a brick wall on the left side : that 's where they stuck the bags of sand . just what a fighter needs before a fight ( or anyone needs at any time of their life ) - to be punching compacted bags of crushed rock . this is a clear defect : i am considering returning it . not sure if they 're all like this , but i assume mine is not unique . ca n't find where it says it was manufactured , but in this day and age , and based on the `` craftsmanship '' , it 's reasonable to assume china . hey - at least the cardboard box it came in was made in missouri ! mine also suffered a little damage during shipping : the box had a small hole in it and the bag got scuffed . it usually takes years of pounding before this type of damage occurs on it 's own . hey , it 's hit or miss when you order online , particularly with oversized items , as far as shipping an `` handling '' are concerned . the shipping box was damaged and oil stained , the product poorly constructed . so , i 'd call this a `` miss ''
sports	this gun is a piece of $ # ! my bro got it some time ago . he was so excited . it made me glad to see that he was so gung ho about his new airsoft . he loaded it , aimed at a 1-foot target not more than 20 feet away , sprayed as accurately as possible , and guess what happened ... ? yup , out of the 20 in the clip , about 5 or 6 hit . not on the bull 's eye , i can tell you that . the 20 shots went wayyyyyyy too fast for comfort , and the accuracy sucked like mad , but my brother 's hopes were not dashed yet . ( -_- ) he filled up the 110-shot mag , winded it up , aimed , and the same thing resulted , only this time , the spray lasted longer than 3.5 seconds . out of maybe 50 shots fired , about 12 hit . i checked the gun all around , but it was not defective at all , except for the part that this gun was made very cheaply . my brother tried it on semi-auto , which is usually more accurate . not for this gun , though . in fact , the semi-auto was even less accurate than the automatic feature ! ! ! out of 10 shots , one or two hit ! i could n't tell because this gun 's 140 fps made barely a sound when it hit the target ! ( we were shooting in the dark . ) let 's not even talk about the `` red dot scope , '' or the `` silencer . '' i only gave it a two because ( 1 ) that is the next lowest you can give , and ( 2 ) this gun 's looks is okay . please buy a different gun off ebay or something ! ! ! you can get an m16 with a grenade launcher with 300 fps and 300 mag cap for less than 20 bucks ( if you bid correctly ) ! by the time my brother had finished playing , his dopamine levels were probably under normal . in simple terms , he was disappointed
sports	this rack was great and easy to install . but i never got a chance to put my bike on it for the night i installed it some person backed into and ran off . what made it even more sad was the bolt that locks the rack into my hitch was bent in the hitch . since i was poor and not willing to pay someone to cut it off i painfully unscrewed it which took hours and blisterd hands . over all i though it was a great rack i just wished someone did not back into it but i know for a fact it did some harm to that persons car/truck .
sports	except for the nifty little metal clips that keep the strap at the length you set until you press on it to lengthen/shorten the strap again . does exactly what it is supposed to do , and makes for challenging exercises due to the inherent instability . great for spotting oneself too . i would buy it again , tho i do n't think it is as indispensible as some might have you believe . so if you can burn the $ 35 or so , get it with no fear . otherwise , use your frustration to fuel your desire to workout
sports	my wife and i love this product . now , it 's not for backpacking , but it does work great as a car camping or base camp stove . it does require one of those disposable propane tanks ( which can be tough to dispose of ) , and it might make sense to get the carrying case ( not seeing it attached here ) . but besides that , a great , simple stove which can be used in all kinds of conditions
sports	the bike arrived in fine condition , no problems with bent or rusty parts like other people have reported . it was really easy to assemble . once i had assembled it i tried it out and found that it made a really annoying noise as the wheel went around - as if the gears were scraping against something . so , i undid all the screws ( a pain ) and opened the plastic-enclosed base . there was a bracket that was meant to hold the pulse wires out of the way , but the adhesive on it had worn off or something and it was just kind of hanging , and would interfere with the gears . so i taped it to the side , closed the plastic up , and that was that . since then the bike has worked really well . i wish there was more ability to move it back - it is a good length for me but i can see how someone taller could have trouble with it . the seat is not terribly comfortable , which gets to be a problem on longer rides , but it 's fixable with a pillow or cushion . the console is great - has all the information displayed all the time . plenty of resistance . overall there are some problems with it , but for under two hundred dollars , i suppose i ca n't complain too much . definitely worth the money
sports	... for more than a couple of minutes ( no matter what i did ) and the toilet monster kept falling into the drink . overall it was quite underwhelming as a practical joke . i 've gotten much better results for the same money with other products
sports	this ramp set is really fun to skate on , but keep in mind that it takes a lot of damage . first it will begin to slide when you skate on it due to lost rubber bottoms . screwing screws into the edges of the ramp can somewhat solve this problem . the worst thing that happens is when the front of the ramp begins to curl upward , making it so you have to constantly pull it back down . i forgot to do this one time and my skateboard wheels locked up and i went flying . but do n't let this turn you away . it is a good fly box nonetheless , but just keep in mind that a homemade wooden one would last you a lifetime , not a year .
sports	when the product came i realized that it was n't what i was looking for in a fanny pack but i was impressed with its rugged construction . i needed a pack to walk around disney world and thought the two water bottle holders would come in handy . i like to freeze my store bought water bottles so that they stay cold all day . the water bottles that come with this pack are double wide and have a wide top - meaning you ca n't wrap your lips around it like a store bought bottle . plus you have to wash and refill them as opposed to just buying another dasani . unfortunately , you ca n't use the water bottle holder for anything much narrower than the included bottles because there is just a single strap across the bottom preventing their bottle from falling through but that would n't stop a regular 16 oz . job from slipping passed . so i 'm returning mine , but if your looking for non breakable , wide mouthed water bottles , in a rugged waistpack then this is for you . ps for some reason the blue one is cheaper , at least when i bought it
sports	my treadmill came with a heart monitor of the same chest-strap type that only worked about half the time . i never had a problem like that with this one , once it 's on , it keeps reading until i take it off . it 's also compatible with all the treadmills/ellipticals/bikes at the gym , so i do n't have to hold the handles any more
sports	most posters here have n't actually bought/used a toilet monster . it 's a really great joke/prank . we bought one and used it for my mother-in-law . she was stunned and a bit disoriented ... then ... wait for it ... she laughed really really hard . it 's not scary , just startling . the way we installed it , if someone opens the lid and seat , they wo n't see it , so it 's best to try on women . great for the price
sports	i bought this for myself to play with ( i 'm 35 ) and after all the presents were opened and toys , video games , and everything were forgotten ( about 4 hours after christmas ) , this was the ongoing favorite of the season . everybody , younger ( down to 8 ) and older ( to 45 ) had a blast with this thing after a couple minutes coaching . it 's already on everybodys wish lists for upcoming birthdays and such . this is a great present for 11-18 boy . fair warning though , there will be some good spills on the fairly short , steep learning curve - helmets , knee pads , blah , blah , are a must ( and a video camera !
sports	after reading the horror stories of the assembly process/instructions i was a little worried . myself and my 12 yr old daughter put it together in about 3 hrs without issue . all parts were included , instructions were clear , she did the step check off 's the base took 400lbs of sand vs the 375lbs stated in the instruction
sports	ok so i read a horrific review but that sounds like a lemon of a stove . our stove is great ! we took it out for a trial run with 12 or so friends and what do know it performed flawlessly . the ignition was quick the cook temp was even and we had our coffee before many others using their colemans . in fact several friends could n't believe the heat this little guy produced . we love this little stove and will be using it for many years to come
sports	rec 'd this pitchback and assembled , the cords that hold net to frame disintegrated and broke free after a short period of time . park sun was unwilling to replace or address faults . very disappointed .
sports	i ordered this pilates ring because i had used one in my health club- big mistake . it is plastic with little resistance and is totally useless . would n't even be of much use for a wheelchair-bound old lady . ( the vendor sent it fast though .
sports	this is a great tennis bag with good space . fits 3 racquets easily and several separate areas . i love it
sports	we opened 2 razor bumper buggy 's for hanukkah that we got as gifts from a family member . both of them were missing the charger for the battery ( and other hardware ) , so our kids could n't even play with them . they were very disappointed . what is worse , razor 's customer service is terrible ! they would not send us the missing chargers without a receipt . of course , since they were gifts , we did n't have the reciept . razor refused to help us until we could get proof of purchase from a credit card statement , which wo n't be for a couple of weeks . then of course it will take a couple more weeks to actually get the chargers . all this hassle , all the hours on the phone , when they could have just sent us the missing chargers , like any decent company would for such a high price item ! our poor kids , just looking at their motionless bumper cars . of course , we ca n't actually review whether the prodcut is any good or not until sometime in februrary when we actually get to use it . happy hanukkah to you too , razor
sports	keeps the drinks chilled but not cold what do you expect for $ 20bucks would no buy again . would go for the more traditional fridges
sports	i have a small head and this was way too tight for me . it pulled my hair and left me with a headache . plus it has a strong chemical smell that did n't go away after wearing in the pool . i tried it 3 times , thinking it might get better , but gave up and threw away . spend a little more and get the fabric or silcon style instead
sports	i bought mine at the same toys r ' us sale and had the exact same issue . both my husband and i own trek bikes and it would n't work his bike at all . it fit on mine only to find out that my heels would hit the footrest of the carrier . i woulud only recommend buying if you have the patience to install it on your bike only to find out that it wo n't work comfortably while you 're riding . not to mention that my two year old is very tall and he did n't look comfortable in it anyway . the free helmet is way too small for his head . we 've returned it and have yet to purchase a different one yet . i think we 're going to a bike shop
sports	i 'm on my 5th cap now i think . silicone is great and lasts forever . unlike rubber ( which can snag hair ) and latex ( which some people are allergic to ) silicone fits smoothly over wet hair , has a glossy finish so it looks great and does n't lose elasticity . i have a some advice if you want to try this product that i 've learned overt the years : 1 . always rinse and hang dry . i 've left wet caps in my gym bag and after a month of two of neglect , it develops black spots . i do n't know if it 's mold , it does n't wash off ... and you 'll have to buy a new cap if you do n't like the spotted look . 2 . pull it on gently . i 've ripped one when i was trying to stretch it over my head because my long nails cut right through it . it 's not cloth so you have to be careful . this goes for latex and rubber , too . 3 . wet your hair first . if your hair is dry when you put it on , you will trap air under the cap . and since it 's not a permeable material , the cap will start to come off while you swim because of the air trying to escape inside . 4 . pick a fun color . that 's it . have a great swim
sports	i got this watch to help me decrease my times for 5k , and it defiantly not 95 % accurate . i run ~10-11 minute mile ; yet , both on the treadmill and outside , this watch was reading ~7.5 to 8 minute mile . distance was also off by +20 % , when running . speed and distance ~98 % accurate for walking 15 min/mile .
sports	i car camp around 6 weeks a year . every night on a different spot . i was looking for a light and sturdy table . easy to setup and easy to pack . this table is not the right table for me . yes it 's light . that 's the only good atribute i can find for this table . it 's cumbersome to setup . the plastic tabs that hold it together are very fragile . the end caps on the ribs of the top surface started falling off even before the table was assembled . it 's low to the ground . i would not buy this table again , nor i would recommend anyone to buy it . i give it one star because i ca n't give it any lower . alvaro sacramento , ca
sports	i bought the large for my 90lb 11 month old lab/great dane mix and it is pretty big on him . admittedly he 's still pretty skinny despite his weight but i had to tighten the straps all the way in order to fit him . probably better for broader dogs but i 'm sure mine will grow into it : o ) the quality is excellent and there 's plenty of packing space , overall i 'm pleased with it especially for the price . if your dog is skinny/narrow i 'd order the next smaller siz
sports	we bought our machine 2 weeks ago . it looks wonderful , nice sturdy , with alot of different features , but we have n't been able to use it . it did n't work from the day we brought it home and have been fighting with ironman 's customer service department ever since . they keep giving us the runaround saying different technicians are coming but nobody ever shows up . evertime we call their 1800 number we 're on hold for at least 30 minutes before we even get to talk to a person and then they just lie and say they will either call us back or have someone out that day . well after 2 weeks , we 've had it ! we 're taking it back and never buying another ironman product again . they 're nice machines with good warrentys but what good is it if they wo n't get anyone out there to fix it ? nothing against the store , they 've been great . just 2 big thumbs down for the manufacturer
sports	on the basis of the first review here , i ordered this bike and could n't be happier with it . this is the first piece of exercise equipment i 've ever tried that is worth the space it takes up . i use it every day
sports	the last ball i had requirted the bicycle pump to fill it . i 'm just too lazy to run out and find the bike pump every time i need a little more air . the pump that comes with this ball doubles for filling other things too . at my kids birthday party i used it to fill some inflatable decorations and i 've used it to fill an air mattress . so two things : the ball is easily inflated and the pump is handy
sports	three days after i put this on my keyring , the two parts of the highgear smartlatch broke apart and i could n't put them back together . then , a week later , the compass popped out of the case . it 's now in my tool drawer . perhaps , only mine was this fragile
sports	do not waste your money . i wish i could give it zero star
sports	i purchased these teva 's for kayaking . these are the most uncomfortable sandals i have ever worn . they are even painful while sitting in a boat . i do not recommend them
sports	if you are out in the cold and its important for your hands to be warmed then you need these hand/pocket warmers ! they are even great for just being outside for a walk ! i have poor circulation and must keep my hands warm to avoid pain and these warmers do the trick
sports	perfect way to ensure you are drinking the minimum requirement of 8-8 oz . servings of water each day . fill it up in the morning and make sure it 's empty by the time you go to bed at night ! very sturdy and best of all - no plastic taste to your water !
sports	i own several led flashlights including 3 different ones from c crane company . this little unit from garrity outshines them all . it is a bright far reaching light and the long battery life is impressive all in a light that fits in the palm of your hand . if you need just one handy convinient flashlight to carry with you , throw that old 3 cell mag light in the trash and welcome to the new age of flashlights
sports	the sportline 353 talking pedometer works ok as a pedometer and as an fm radio , but it has 2 issues . the good : the talking part of this pedometer can be turned off or on . it is nice to hear when you are rolling along , `` 9000 steps . '' the fm radio is very elementary , but functional . there is no dial to tune . you push a button and it rolls to the next station . there is a volume control on the earphones . the pedometer uses aaa batteries that can be purchased anywhere . the bad : the pedometer was constantly slipping off my waistband and bouncing on the floor . it did n't break , but it was very annoying . several times it popped off w/o me knowing and i left it in a restaurant or in a friend 's car . the ugly : if i accidentally bumped the reset button - on the kitchen counter or on the arm of a chair - the pedometer lost the day 's count and went back to zero . the pedometer does not have a memory feature - so the tally is lost . this would sometimes happen 2-3 times a day . very frustrating . the clip broke after about 3 months -- so i retired it . i bought a omron hj112 premium pedometer and have been very pleased with it . it has a teather so if the clip slips off my waistband , the pedometer dangles -- it does not bounce on the floor . it has a 7-day memory feature and automatically resets at midnight . it has a clock . it uses a button battery . it does not have a radio and it does n't talk , but it works and works well . the sportline would be good if it had a teather , a clip that did n't break so easily , and a reset button that could not be pushed accidentally .
sports	the attachment is n't textured enough to stay where i put it . as i ride the entire assembly slowly spins around the handle under my hand
sports	i am very pleased with this rack . the only thing i do not like is that to install the rack you have to hand tighten it to your roof rack . i would have thought they would have a quick release latch or something . i guess i 'm just lazy . i reccoment this product
sports	we just got this bag today for our son . we got the short version of this bag , but i do n't see that version on amazon anymore . the outside is a very nice rip-stop nylon material and soft and cuddly , and the zipper is very smooth . the inside is a little scratchy , but i am sure it will be better after a washing . the drawstring around the hood pulls nice and tight to keep out the air . the only thing i was disappointed about was the color . the picture on amazon , and on the box it came in , is turquiose . the bag is definitely not turquiose ! it is a darker blue - closer to navy - color . and the yellow is more of a mustard color , not a bright yellow , and the inside is dark gray . but my son likes it anyhow , and of course it does n't affect the quality of the bag . i like the fact that the hood turns inside out , too
sports	the schwinn airdyne is built to last out of steel . for upper and lower body workout , it uses a fan/flywheel to create resistance rather than a friction belt or magnetic motor ; hint -- fewer repairs and failures since there is no friction mechanism to fail . the onboard computer allows your to select what information you wish to see such as mets , calories , distance , speed , rpm and even displays your pulse if you wear a chest strap . you can select miles or kilometers for distance and `` club or home '' for setup ; hint -- built to withstand use in a fitness center/health club . it even allows you to imput your geological elevation to facilitate a more accurate calorie count . assembly is straight foward but does require a few basic tools such an adjustable wrench and phillips screwdriver . this represents a good way to go if you want a well built durable piece of equipment intended for serious use to achieve your goal of cardio-vascular conditioning , weight loss or just plain old exercise
sports	when i first got the bike , i thought it was great . by 2nd ride the chain broke while i was trying to do a simple down shift . unfortunately it also took out the shimano shifter mechanism which equates to big bucks in repair cost . looking at the metal used it is no wonder it did n't last . very poor quality . too bad , because it is a great looking bike . i guess i 'll give wal mart a try next ... ... ...
sports	i got this for my daughter awhile ago , but due to no snow , i had to wait to actually see if it worked . well , it did ! nicely made and durable . daughter loved it .
sports	this was a bitter disappointment . one of the features we expected to get the most use from was the volume control . however , if we raise the volume much more than a quarter of a setting , we get horrific feedback ( screeching ) . nothing seems to help and when i sent a note to the manufacturer for advice , i never received an answer . unfortunately i 'd already disposed of the packing info when we discovered the problem , so it looks like it 'll hit the trash . save your money and do n't purchase this item
sports	i will never purchase an item from babyride again . this canopy is misleading . it said it keeps out the sun and it is made of net . the sun came right through and blinded my baby . not only that . it is not worth the price ! ! you could go to a fabric store and buy the same netting for $ 5 . also , when i went to return the item they charged me a restocking fee which i had never heard of ! ! ! bad item . i ordered the rayshade by kiddopotamus and loved it ... get this one instead !
sports	this is not as described..it is very hard to move - heavy and bulky . if you have a place to set it up and leave it , fine , but this is not going to be pulled out every day for a 'stroll in front of the tv ' , as described . performance-wise it seems very nice and is a good solid piece of equipment , but definitely not an item that can be put away after each use . i 'm disappointed
sports	easy set up and directions and great functionality . no problems what-so-ever picking up the wireless signal .
sports	first off you can find this price lots of places . it is probably the minimum sale price allowed by schwinn . i choose to buy mine through amazon becasue i got 3 % back with my visa , free delivery , and did n't pay sales tax . that made up for most of the cost difference between the 212 and the 213 . i wanted the extra programs . delivery was smooth except they had to come back once for me to sign for the delivery . no problems with the packaging in our case . assembly took about an hour and a half . it was pretty simple and the tools you need were included which was nice . overall this assembly was much easier than most things i have put together . the bike is stable , quiet and smooth . easy to ride and easy to adjust between the big guy and the little woman . overall we are very pleased and look forward to years of use . i did n't rate this a 5 cause we 've only had ours a week
sports	some of the pros of buying the sniper rifle is ... it shoots crazy fast and is very accurate i shot my uncle with it and it made him bleed none of the kids in my neighborhood want to fite against me any more some of the cons of buying the sniper rifle is ... the safety ca n't be pushed to hard or it comes out the handle starts getting kind of wobly and mine came off the battery takes longer than it says to charge to work please take my advice because i have had this gun for more than a year now and i know it front and back
sports	very heavy easily torn -- reinforcement non fucnctional -- doubt i can cover my bike 10 times before it is torn to shreds -- i would not reccomend it at all -- wasted my mone
sports	i bought this for my medium sized 9mm . luger with the laser sight attached to it . my cousine , who has been in the military for several years , recommended it to me . i 'm only 3 feet 6 inches tall , and it fits me well . he is over six feet tall , and it fits him just as well . it takes a little time to adjust it to your liking but , well worth the money . it is comprable to holster costing 5 times as much
sports	description of bike was misleading . weight limit of person using this exercise bike should have been part of description . small print in booklet accompanying bike says it is unsafe for more than 250 pounds . although i weigh slightly less than this , i am afraid to use the bike for fear of it falling apart . i would not have purchased the bike had i seen this limit in the description . also , the directions for operation of this bike are very complicated . i thought i was purchasing a simple exercise bike , not such a complicated piece of machinery . this bike would be perfect for a younger , more athletic , slimmer person
sports	there were a few minor imperfections , but i 'm overall happy with this sword . the attention to detail and replication of cloud 's weapon are commendable
sports	this gun is absolutley terrible . the third time i shot it , the thing broke ! the pellets it came with were not even perfect circles and you could not load them . i would tell you more of how bad this was but i really do n't want to waste any more of my time
sports	this works pretty well to get back and forth between classes , although you can tell that it 's a toy at heart . if you 're looking for something fun and easy , i recommend this scooter
sports	i bought this backpack last minute for a weekend in the columbia gorge area , it worked great . the backpack does n't strain my back at all , the load felt very even . and the attached rainfly came in handy once as well . it comes with a bunch of extra attached straps to secure all the extras ( tent rods , sleeping pad , rope , etc ... ) i am thoroughly impressed to have found a good pack for such a bargain pric
sports	i trained for a marathon and several 10k races using a heart rate monitor . they are very good instruments for training and i recommend them to everyone who wants to lose weight or get in shape . after you 've purchased one or two of them , you become a better shopper . i purchased an f-4 for a friend , and i was very , very disappointed in the battery life when i found out how soon the battery in the main unit wore out . some of the newer heart monitors - nikon for one- have user replaceable batteries so you can save a lot of money and time replacing batteries after one or two years
sports	we had been looking for a light-weight backpacking tent with enough room for two . that seems simple enough , unless you 've actually been inside of some of the `` two-person '' tents . some of the expedition tents meet the size requirements , but are too heavy to be considered backpacking tents . we have just used this tent for the first time , and we are so far pleased . plenty of room inside for two adults with large sleeping mats and sleeping bags , and a bit of gear . a large vesitibule on each side provides plenty of room for packs . i believe this will be a great warm-weather tent , with all of the mesh . the night we used it , it dropped below freezing . we woke to a ceiling ( rainfly ) covered in ice ( on the inside ) . did n't really expect that , with all of the ventilation , but as it was ice , it did n't drip on us . i 'll chalk this experience up to extreme conditions until we use it in warmer weather . one thing that i do n't like , although thus far it has not been an issue , is a seam running through the middle of the floor . it has been taped and sealed at the factory , but i just do n't like the looks of it . i will seal it again before spring use , and edit this report , as we are sure to end up in a downpour here in south texas . the tent is in fact lightweight and roomy , and so far , i am pleased . i will amend this report after having enountered weather with it
sports	i am not an exercise person . but , i need to keep moving and others in my family have bone issues that mean they should n't exercise in a manner that stresses the joints . this machine is perfect for all of us . i put the machine together and found it to be quite sturdy and fairly heavy . the electronics on it are working just fine . it 's the kind of exercise machine that i can get on , watch tv , and forget i 'm actually exercising
sports	the scooter is fine . the post office lost the package , though . i called the company and they told me they would issue a refund only after so many days/weeks , and would not send a replacement unless i was willing to pay for it in advance . i opted to purchase another one through a different company that used ups instead of usps ( more reliable shipping ) . several days later the first scooter arrived , three weeks late . the cost to return it was high enough that it made more sense to just keep it . so , now i have two and only needed one . i realize usps is at fault for the shipping , but a better action plan from the seller could have resolved this quicker . the scooter was a present for a birthday . i ordered in plenty of time to receive prior , but ended up with a very late present
sports	this paddle is a bargain here at amazon . sports stores would easily sell this for over $ 20 . having said that , i found it to be slightly heavier and the thicker sponge made it difficult for me to adjust my game . `` but '' , i still eliminated many a younger player at our men 's retreat . there 's nothing better than seeing the face of a 23 year old when a 53 year old kicks his rear ! thanks , stiga
sports	i thought this would be the ultimate gym bag . the main compartment is too narrow . your shoes will not fit side by side , you have to stack them . the pockets do not expand wide enough and are not deep enough . the zippers are cheap and stick . it is very pretty but not very functional . my $ 16.00 bag works much better .
sports	i bought these gloves for my wife who has problems keeping her hands warm . the description of the gloves would have you believe that the battery powered gloves ( using d cell batteries ) would provide heat to the hands for 6 to 8 hours . in actuality , the battery will only provide heat for 35 to 40 minutes before it ends . to make matters worse , the only heat provided is to the palm of the hand , no heat is provided to the fingers ! i did not use a cheap brand of battery for these gloves . the first battery that i tried ( it takes one d cell per glove ) was duracel with an experation date of 2013 ( in other words , brand new battery with lots of shelf life left ) . that battery provided heat for 40 minutes before dying . the second set of batteries that i tried ( with the same experation date ) were made by eveready . that battery lasted 35 minutes . you should also note that the duracel fits poorly in the connector case and the eveready battery fits even worse ! these gloves are on their way to goodwill . maybe they can be used by some one as work gloves or something . if you are considering these gloves , think again ! the chemical packs work much better although they ( the chemical packs ) do have a shelf life . it just seemed such a waste to us to use a chemical pack for a one hour walk and then have the pack continue to provide heat for another 4 to 6 hours . still , that is better than using up two d cell batteries for less heat that only lasts about 40 minutes .
sports	safety key was fine ... except i purchased treadmill without book and it was not the size i was looking for . i took a chance at the size so my own fault
sports	the pedometer worked great for the first two weeks . than my 1 1/2 year old snatched it off my jeans , it fell on the tile floor and broke the casing of it . it still worked , but i had to be careful when i opened it because the back was broken and no longer attached . last w/e it stopped working completely . everthing is set to 0 and wo n't move . my husbands odometer seems to be working fine . however , i 'm dissapointed for the short life-span ... . m. l. mcdermot
sports	this is a great light , perfect for a `` be seen '' and backup light in addition to a stronger source . the plastic handlebar mount failed on mine the first time out , apparently cracking from vibration fatigue . the customer support from princeton was terrific , though , and they sent a replacement mount ( i contacted them on friday and had the part monday ) . i may try to rig a velcro strap through the clip and attach that directly around the bar instead of using the supplied part
sports	the bike was delivered 70 % ( rough guesstimate ) put together . it was relatively easy to complete myself ( only had to use manual a few of times ) and i 'm certainly no expert . the only problem i encountered , was getting the front brake pads to align properly on the tire . with that being said ... . i spent a few dollars at our local bike/cycle shop to have it looked over ( basic tune-up service ) to make sure it was safe to ride . the bike now rides nicely and serves as my cruise around town bike . overall , i think this is good value for the money ... but only if you 're looking for a hybrid type bike for shorter ( more casual ) trips
sports	i just returned from a 20-day trip , and this new backpack went along . it is comfortable , commodious and just the ticket . i have a 25-year-old jansport backback ( still ticking , but a bit tattered ) that i have used and used , and i expect this one will provide the same service . it 's great
sports	i 've never been a fan of propane stoves . they always seemed flimsy , made for those toy-sized backpacking pots and pans and potentially dangerous - until now . after two weeks of rv-ing , the fold 'n go has become a welcome addition to our set up . it is very sturdy and seems extremely well made . the wide separation of the two burners and heavy-duty pot supports allow for two large , heavy fry pans and/or stock pots at one time . few stoves of any kind can handle simultaneous large pots . and it seems very stable when set on a table . and because it folds in half and becomes its own carry-case , even though it handles such large tasks , it 's easy to carry and takes up very little storage space . it also has an instant start feature - you just turn the nob and then press a button and that 's it . you 're ready to cook . and after you 're done , clean up is a snap . unlike other stoves where you have to take them all apart to try and get at that nasty , spattered grease , this one is pretty much all sealed - just take the pot supports off , wipe off underneath , flip the pot supports over to store inside and then fold 'n go ! it 's great to get cooking moved outside the rv - especially for things like frying bacon or cooking anything that gives off a lot of steam . and because our meals seem to entail usually one or the other , we plan on getting an extension hose off our main propane tank to run this frequently in the future .
sports	great little knife . i 've taken to carrying it with me on every occasion my native is too big . super sharp and keeps its edge even after some pretty heavy use . only beef is that it 's a little hard to open and close with one hand because of its size . i 'm going to have to get the leek
sports	i had a similar experience as did others with the packaging of this product . the box was literally falling apart when it arrived . luckily no parts were damaged . on the plus side , the package arrived very quickly . the bench has lots features for the price . it was not difficult to assemble . it folds up very nicely as advertised . it is sturdy and easy to adjust . this is a very good value
sports	two years ago , i tore one of the transverse ligaments in my wrist playing racquetball , which was the unfortunate combination of a dusty court , 200 pounds of player moving about 15 miles an hour , a poorly timed forehand and very hard wall . i had two surgeries to repair the injury , and it was mostly successful . the biggest side effect has been weakness in my injured wrist and hand . i have moved beyond squeezing toys and putty , but i lacked the strength to do weight training . this device has been a tremendous breakthrough for me . i have been able to make some rapid gains in my strength without risking injury with weights . i am already seeing the difference in just two weeks . if you are recovering from surgery such as carpal tunnel or other wrist related injuries , i strongly recommend making this device part of your recovery plan . of course , check with your doctor and/or physical therapist before starting up a new exercise
sports	i agree with the other reviewers that the idea for this product was going in the right direction , but took a bad turn somewhere . i get lightheaded trying to suck hard enough on the straw for it to register , and even when it does it is consistently 8 to 10 ounces off the mark of what i 've actually consumed . and if you 're really thirsty , forget it - you 'll pass out before ever getting enough fluid to quench your thirst . at $ 30 , it 's a hefty price to pay when it 's much simpler to just refill a 20-ounce plastic bottle 3 times a day . sorry to say i 'll be returning my hydracoach
sports	the first thing that i thought was `` this is a lot of equipment for the money '' . it comes well wrapped and is easy to assemble . took me about an hour . it 's relatively sturdy , although there is some minor movement of the frame when changing exercises ( eg , the frame will move slightly forward when moving from leg lifts to dips ) . overall , i do not see how they make money selling it this inexpensively based on the good quality of this machine . keep in mind , that in order to use the chin up bar , there needs to be enough clearance from the top of the machine to the ceiling , as your chin will touch the top of the machine . most residential ceilings are about 8 feet
sports	when i received the flashlight it was broken i have tried to contact mark golden in delray , florida , the place the flashlight was sent from , and have heard nothing back this week
sports	this stand deserves a 0 , but that wasnt an option . the engineers that designed it were smoking something wicked . it is of poor design and quality . i wouldnt take if they were givin it away . i 've had it set up in my basement for a few days and i couldnt wait to take it down and return . which i did . pronto . do yourself a favor . stay away
sports	i 'll be returning right away . suction cup does not hold at all . completely useless..
sports	was billed by the company and they never sent it ... had to challenge the company to get a credit ... still waiting for my bill to see if credit was done..
sports	this is the kind of gift you will give to someone you really , really hate . this thing does not shuffle plus it will eat up your cards badly . do not buy this piece of garbage ... that is unless you wish to annoy the hell out of someone and have fun doing so . if you do go ahead and spend your hard earn mula on this purchase , here are some suggestions on how you can use your brand new card shuffler . 1 . pet dog 's chew toy 2 . door stop 3 . play street hockey 4 . stress release stomping toy 5 . mother-in-law birthday gift 6 . modern art for coffee table 7 . nerf ball target practice 8 . condom dispenser kind of think about it , this is a great toy . have fun ! ps . if you are looking for a shuffler that really works maybe you should take a look at : excalibur professional 6 deck card shuffler ; you might like it .
sports	i 've owned three pairs of these so far , and they 're easily the best gloves i 've ever used . i had previously only used unpadded gloves , and the padding in the palm seemed a little thick at first . the padding does make it more difficult to get a solid grip in some exercise machines that also have large rubber grips on them ( lat pulldown bars , for example ) , but that 's the trade off for excellent support and protection when using the gloves on machines with uncovered metal grips . i found these gloves to be more durable than the other non-padded harbinger gloves i 've worn . the gloves can be safely washed and air dryed , as advertised . my only complaint with regard to wear is that the unreinforced leather where my thumb meets the padding in the palm seems to wear out before the rest of the glove . every pair i have owned will eventually wear a hole in this particular area .
sports	if you study pilates then you will see how the performers do not have the proper body positions . one of the girls keeps staring at the camera for no reason and moving her body when it should be still . as a lover of pilates and how much it has done for me , i urge you to buy something else
sports	i consider my dogs to be small - they are all around 25 pounds . i have had to tighten everything on the backpack to keep them from being too loose and i still feel like they are a little bit too big . i think that for a `` small '' backpack , that they are just too large . thank you
sports	i wanted a high quality yoga mat that was long in length because i am a tall person . i thought i had picked the perfect mat when i ordered this one . i did n't have a problem with the length ( although it smelled that new plastic stench ) but i did have a problem with the weight . this mat is heavy ! i knew it would be heavy when i purchased it and being a person in somewhat good shape i did n't think i would mind it but i did n't realize that it would be cumbersome . the last straw that made me want to return it was when i was in a yoga class ; sweating and i began to slip on the mat . if i am going to spend this amount of money on a yoga mat i do n't want any problems . to amazon 's credit i was able to return it and they paid for postage . if i would have had to pay for the return postage myself it would have cost a lot because of how heavy it is but i would have paid it anyway ( that should tell you how much i did n't like it ) . i am now looking for a long mat but lighter and toxic free . i want something that will be biodegradable . the problem now is there are so many mats available ( too many choices can be just as frustrating as too few ) .
sports	i have bought over 20 of these knives . i trim my nails , open packages , write notes , tighten screws , and strip wire ( great for stripping wire ) . you can buy replacement toothpicks and pens . i put toothpicks in place of the twizzers . i have never used the twizzers in 30 years . i can use the toothpick a couple times a day . i would love to see a thinner version with an led , toothpick and pen . airport security keeps taking my knives . remember to remove the pen and toothpick if they do take it . the pen just pulls out . this is the best most used tool i have ever owned
sports	we bought these so the children could have something to play with during the winter . we backed our vehicles out of the garage , and zoom ... .they were off having fun . the box says `` ages 3+ '' and up to 55 pounds . the bumper buggie looks small , but it is roomy enough for my 5 1/2 year old . he weighs 45 pounds and is 45 inches tall . he can stretch his legs out in the car , but chooses to keep his knees bent while driving . my two year old can also work the controls . it is easy to use and the kids can do a complete 360 . my only complaint is that it is a little bit noisy , but no more than other battery-operated vehicles . i highly recommend this item . it is so much fun ! best part is that there is little assembly required . the only thing we had to do was screw the seat into the car
sports	i try to use this but do n't work good ! ! . the best option is play in a court
sports	this gun is not good . it is a piece of crud . beginners could buy a gun thats about 100 times better from walmart for only 20 bucks . get it if your a idiot . i wish i could give it 0 star
sports	the front wheels came off the first day ... christmas day ! very frustrating !
sports	the first schwinn fitness 212 that was sent never arrived because it was damaged in transit . the second one arrived but does not work . after calling technical assistance and being instructed to re-examine the contacts ( which i did ) , it still does not work . this is absolutely useless . they will have to do something
sports	the fat mouth clamp-ons were easy to install and withheld a 15 hour trip from texas to colorado and back again . they came off my luggage rack very quickly and when when we are ready to use it again , will be quickly put back on . i would recommend this product to anyone looking for an attachment for ski rack to thier factory installed luggage rack .
sports	i was a little skeptical about the gazelle at first because it did n't look like you could get a work out from using it - but i was wrong ! but let 's start at the beginning : it 's pretty easy to set up - the directions on the dvd were great and i could do it all myself . i was really excited to use it so i hopped right on ( i 'm already used to ellipticals ) and enjoyed a great workout . i was sweating and after watching the training dvd , i worked my upper body and lower body . i look forward to using it tomorrow . now i do n't have to drag myself to the gym . i can work out at home ! downsides : it does squeak , but some wd40 or petroleum jelly should fix that . it folds up but it 's not extremely portable . i have it in my living room currently . all in all i recommend this product . i can feel the toning and with good diet and weight training , you 'll see results
sports	i have been purchasing a few of these self charging flashlights lately to find the best one . this one puts out a a poor amount of light . it also does not retain its charge well . you will have to shake it frequently to keep it charged . i would say it is one of the worst ones i purchased
sports	this product is not very good . the speed registers at least 6 miles per hour faster than radar gun . getting the grip on the ball correct to make it even register a speed is difficult and frustrating . avoid this ball
sports	it is amazing to me how something like this could even be approved for the market - this pump is 100 % junk . so bad , that i am finding my self actually writing a review about a bicycle pump . the instructions were a disaster ... . and why would i need to look at instructions for a pump ? - well , that is because it does not work , and i mean does not work at all ! the lever on the side is a total gimmick ( does nothing as the previous review states ) . save your money here - do not buy this pump .
sports	it works like a hook for clothes of my wife ;
sports	i 've always loved victorinox swiss army knives , but i must admit that i when i purchased this one , i was not sure if i made the right choice , but my expectations were soon exceeded . it was right before a trip to the boundary waters canoe area wilderness in minnesota , i had lost my other swiss army knife ( a tinker ) , and i was looking for a versatile knife with a locking blade . i did not need dozens of other tools for my pending stay in the wilderness . i settled on this one because it was on sale , and i have not been disappointed . the handle has a mild contour that made it very comfortable to handle . for its size , it had just the right heft , but it was not too heavy to weigh down my shirt ( where i kept it in my buttoned breast pocket ) . the 4 '' locking blade worked wonderfully . i could close it with either one or two hands . when closing it , the blade pauses at the halfway point , reducing the risk of closing it on your fingers when closing it one-handed ( that said , it does not eliminate all risk , so close the knife with one hand at your own risk ) . during my recent canoe trip , i lost my fillet knife on a portage trail and was surprised that cleaning a 24 '' northern pike with this blade was quite painless ( though it did take some skill ) . beyond the blade , i 've always found the leather awl and the screwdriver handy , but the can opener blade is a primary reason why i prefer victorinox swiss army knives over those produced by wegner . the knife shipped in a simple cardboard box . a sheath or pouch would have been nice , but i was able to fabricate one with duct tape before my trip . since i kept it in my shirt pocket for most of my trip , the sheath was n't necessary , but it is one accessory you should consider purchasing if you choose this knife . i recommend getting one . you will not be disappointed
sports	estos son los guantes que mas me gustan para nadar . mucho mejores que los aqua sphere . el asunto es que duran poco . despues de unas 50 idas a nadar , ya estan muy rotos y hay que conseguirse otros . tambien hay que tener cuidado con el tamaño . yo tengo manos grandes y solo me sirven bien el tamaño medium . por el resto el producto es muy bueno , y comodo .
sports	this backpack is a great size but the zippers are nylon and are already separating and getting stuck , it would have been better with metal zipper
sports	i am a 71 yrs young female . i purchased these `` men 's '' skates for myself . i bought a size larger and they are very comfortable . as an older `` re '' learner these skates worked out just great . the wheel 's do n't have speed , which is what i was looking for . they are indoor // outdoor skates . they work better for inside skating . a great price and a great quality skate . especially for a beginner ( the wheels ) . no matter what age you are , these skates are the best . i love these skates
sports	i have had this stroller for one day and i 'm going to send it back or sell it . i am so disappointed . i was so excited for this to arrive . we set it up ... instructions were a little shady here and there , and i try and adjust the seat . i have the strap pulled all the way back and my two year old looks like he is almost laying down . he hates it . he is a very happy kid and loves to ride in his stroller . he was miserable because he could n't sit up and look around , plus the tray was at such a weird angle in relation to the seat angle that he could n't even see the cheerios on the tray from his angle ! his playtex sippy could n't fit into the small hole for a drink in the kids tray , and my water fell out over and over again from the parents tray . the construction is great , the fabrics are nice ... .overall i could have given it five stars , but the seat positioning is so extreme that it makes my son start to cry ... .that makes it a really crummy purchase . if you are wondering about which one to buy , do not buy this one unless your kid loves looking at the sky all through your walks
sports	do not buy this bike . i got to ride mine for about 35 minutes before it was broke . the crank is cheap aluminum and the peddals are steal , well the steal threads chew right through the aluminum in no time flat .
sports	i just got mine 3 days ago . i can see that it might help toning the areas . and the video is not annoying . what is a problem is the wonderful bruising on my legs where the device sits for the workout . i did n't purchase this item for weight loss , i thought it would help for toning . but the bruises , while they may go away with continued use , are not worthe the $ $ . i am sending mine back today . sorry
sports	before buying ddr , i read everyone 's reviews , and thought that after all of the bad reviews i might still like it . this product really fools you , this is why : ~if you 've seen regular ddr you know what the pad looks like , well the dance pad and the box looks normal ... untill you turn it on ! ~it says 50 songs , right ? well , it 's not really 50 different songs . about 20-25 of these songs are a trick-they combine 2 songs and make it into one track . ~the graphics are horrible ... a screen looks like pieces of moving clip art stationed around the middle of the screen where the arrows are . i would n't reccommend buying this ... at all
sports	i bought this for my pilates class and in middle of my plank my feet slid right out ! very dissatisfied , socks do not have enough elasticity to stay in place . i much prefer the yoga socks where each toe is apart from the other . i would not recommend these for anyone
sports	... ..that 's the day that the first wiffle balls ( invented a year earlier ) went on sale in this baseball-crazy country . mr. david mullany created the first wiffle ball in fairfield , connecticut after seeing his 12-year-old son struggling to throw a curveball . mr. mullany ( to whom we bow down and show obeisance ) cut eight oblong slots into plastic orbs that were used to package cosmetics and the wiffle ball , an american institution , was born . oh , wiffle ball , wiffle ball , it nearly compels me to wax poetic . i 'm now 46 years old , but the love that i have for the game of wiffle ball will possess my heart long after my body has any capability to throw a breaking pitch ! my brother and i were born to a beautiful , baseball-loving woman . shirley grew up following the cincinnati reds , and as a child , she acquired a nickname based on a long-forgotten big league pitcher . as an adult , she worked for the los angeles dodgers and the los angeles angels ( that was before they became the california angels , and then the anaheim angels , and then the los angeles angels of anaheim , and then the chicago white sox victims ) . she instilled in her two boys and one daughter a love for america 's pastime . ( in fact , my sister was the first girl we ever heard of to play on a boys little league team . ) but when we were n't on a baseball diamond with 7 other guys , and when we could n't scrounge up two other guys to play a game of `` over-the-line '' at the park , my brother , doug , and i were battling it out in a game of wiffle ball in the yard . we had some outrageously competitive games in our `` glory days . '' we perfected the art of pitching a wiffle ball , and baffled many a batter who tried to hit us . i remember 1990 and a young , athletic college student who , claiming to have played wiffle ball throughout his childhood , challenged this old geezer on the ucla field behind the john wooden center . well , my screwball was only breaking about 10 feet that day , and after taking it for strike three about a dozen times , he just shook his head , and i concluded that whatever game he was playing as a child , it was n't what my brother and i called , `` wiffle ball . '' if you have never owned a wiffle ball , you 've never really been alive , my dear friend ! although they do tend to crack between the oblong cutouts after some time ( especially if you hang too many curveballs for my brother who swings with great authority ) , they will last for countless hours of baseballesque bliss and excellent exercise ! they can be used anywhere outdoors because the wiffle ball weighs only two-thirds of an ounce , and if doug never knocked one through a window , neither will you ! and although the wiffle ball is light , it does not follow that it should be taken lightly . after san francisco giant ( man , do i hate the giants ! ) , kevin mitchell won the 1989 national league mvp award , he publicly stated that he had really learned to hit the curveball by playing a lot of wiffle ball the previous off-season . one of the greatest hitters of all-time , san diego padre , tony gwynn used to hit wiffle balls off of a batting tee because he could tell from the spin where he had struck the ball . play with a wiffle ball and you 're in big league company ! the wiffle balls offered here are the regulation 9 inch variety . ( and surprise ! they 're still made in the u.s.a . the day production moves to communist china i 'll jump . ) twelve wiffle balls are currently going for $ 14.95 , that 's only $ 1.25 per ball . do you have any idea how much fun you can have with a wiffle ball ? well , take my word for it , you 'll get more than a dollar and twenty-five cents worth ! now all you need to do is get the regulation , old school , plastic yellow ( `` banana '' ) bat . of course , if you really want to splurge you can purchase the newly invented aluminum wiffle ball bat . funny story : my dear ol ' ma bought an aluminum wiffle ball bat as a gift for my brother on his birthday . but she was n't sure what size to get , so she called the company . `` how old is your son ? '' the representative asked . when she said , `` 41 '' , he laughed loud and said , `` i think you 'll want to go with the heaviest model . '' one of the great disappointments in my life ( seriously ! ) is that they did n't think to organize wiffle ball competitions until doug and i were in our 40 's . we scouted out the competition at the `` wiffle ball world series '' here in phoenix a few years ago . ( players fly in from all over the country ! ) we figured that even at our advanced age and with my arthritis , we could still give those young studs all they bargained for and more , if we polished our long-neglected technique over the next year . alas , it never happened , what with work , and life , and all the other crap that gets in the way of wiffle ball play . but that does n't mean you ca n't fly into phoenix next year and win the title ! get to it , man ! get yourself a dozen wiffle balls , a `` banana '' bat and start practicing . hint : the ball breaks in the direction of the solid half . want to throw a drop ? make sure the solid section is on the bottom at your release point . then get inventive ; there are innumerable variations on that theme ! you can thank me for the hint when you see me . you 'll recognize me because i 'm always the guy who picks up the suitcase that comes around on the airport luggage carrousel with a plastic yellow bat strapped across the top of it !
sports	i bought my son and daughter a pair of these shoes for christmas . i have a hard time getting them to wear regular shoes anymore , they love to wear them everywhere they go . great way to get the kids physically active !
sports	first of all it took like 2 weeks for then gun to get to me . 2 weeks later ... .the piston broke so its not a high quality airsoft gun . but it looks cool and its worth the price
sports	i too recieved this bag in a box semi-beaten up , but then again an 80 pound item in a lightweight cardboard box is bound to cause a little box damage . and no there was no interior protective bag , and my chain pack was tied with pink ribbon . now to the bag itself ... the toughest , most well filled , and economical bags i have ever seen . i use light bag gloves and with the amount of filling and it 's density i can punch for hours ( if i had the stamina : ) ) , without getting the sore knuckles or the wrist pain that i used to get from denser packed bags . plus it 's an everlast ! ! ! this is a must buy for anyone who is looking for a heavy bag . good luck and train hard ! !
sports	i use this pillow in the car and plan to take this on the plane . i do not like the neck pillows and prefer the rectangular shape of this pillow . it rolls up to a nice compact size
sports	this count up/down timer is exactly what i was looking for . no bells , no whistles -- just timings up and down . it 's small and light , and can be clipped or held . it even has a magnet for attaching to metal surfaces . i only wish it had a shut-off switch so that it does n't start counting ( and beeping ) if it 's accidentally brushed
sports	i ordered 2 of these kickboards in blue after reading another review . they are not exactly the same size , but we really like them . they are very versatile and easy to use . i do think they need to put dimensions on the website
sports	i am 6'1 and this jump rope was too short for me , it says that its adujustable , but it can only be made shorter and not longer . for a kid this is a good jump rope , but its definitely not for a tall person
sports	the bowflex series 7 treadmill is as good as advertised . it was easy to assemble and the instructions were thorough . it is also very easy to program and operate . no time is wasted figuring out the instruction manual . i also love the quietness of the motor . because the machine is sturdy you will need some help moving it into place . go ahead and get it ... ma
sports	because you ca n't give negative stars , i 'll give this product one star . i bought this product instead of the ablounge because it could actually support a plus sized weight . i 'm glad this product was cheap , because it was the worst exercise machine i ever bought . everytime i swing on it , i feel it creak and wobble . i feel like its going to break under me each time i use it . it makes a better decoration then it does an exerciser . i 've been useing it for a few months , and all its done is make me feel akward . do n't buy this product if your plus size . if your not plus size , go get the 210 lbs weight limited ab lounger jack knife system thing . if your are of plus size , order the bean full body ( i just did )
sports	not amazon 's fault , but everlast 's . even the box promises 2 10-pound weights , but it is in fact a 10-pound set of 2 5-pound weights . this is not a bargain , but fairly expensive . quality is just ok. not flimsy or dangerous , but not what i wanted , either
sports	my first impression is that the unit is very rugged and nice looking . then i tried to use it . i mostly bought it for the altimeter and thermometer . in the first day of use i just ran out of patience and plan to return it . here 's the problems i had with the altitech2 1 . most of the time the buttons work fine , but several times i pressed the mode button and the mode did not change . 2 . when setting declination page 25 of the manual states that you can press set/reset/light to reverse the digits , but as soon as you press the set/reset/light button the unit ends the calibration mode . 3 . the temperature was stuck at 87.5 degrees for about an hour after purchase . finally after cycling through the mode buttons the temperature instantly dropped to 81.5 degrees . i held the unit in front of the ac vent in the car until the car was cooled down to 70 degrees , i suspect the air coming out of the vent was actually cooler than 70 degrees . the temperature display never budged from 81.5 degrees . 4 . i constructed a rudimentary chamber and placed the altitech2 unit and a digital thermometer in the chamber . the digital thermometer registered 78 degrees , the altitech2 registered 81.4 degrees . i blasted hot air in the chamber with a hair dryer . the digital thermometer quickly rose to 116 degrees and i turned the heat off . the altitech2 stayed at exactly 81.4 degrees . after removing from the chamber the altitech2 slowly increased to 94 degrees , went down to 92.6 degrees and stayed there for a good 5 minutes . despite the room temperature being about 78 degrees . 5 . the compass will only stay on for 10 seconds , then the display turns off to conserve battery . this never seems to be long enough to get a good fix while using in reference to a map . when the display shuts down you need to press the start button again to turn on the display . since this button is recessed , you have to reposition your hand to press the button with your fingernail ( i had to ) . this moves the compass in relation to the map again and is very frustrating to have to constantly have to press the start button . i 'll stick with my 19th century compass for now . this unit might be worth keeping for me if the altimeter is reliable , but after all the other trouble i had i did not even mess with setting up the altimeter as i had lost confidence in the device .
sports	this is a great starter board for the price . my son has really enjoyed using it and the price was unbeatable . seems to be holding up well and it serves the purpose for a beginner
sports	i love my jansport odyssey backpack . it has a lot of room and the straps are much more comfortable than any other backpack i have ever owned or tried . i have a lot of very heavy books and this backpack ca n't be beaten for tranporting books . a little more padding in the straps ( or smaller textbooks ) would make it perfect , but it is still better than anything i have seen out there . i would highly recommend it to any high school or college student
sports	this watch/heart rate monitor is everything i wanted . i can get a heart rate in about 5 seconds by putting your index and middle finger on the two buttons on the top and bottom of the clock face , i havent used the other features yet , but appreciate not wearing a strap hrm anymore
sports	this is a great cot . it is low profile , and made of strong materials . i was worried about the wire legs , but they are very , very strong . so strong that it takes some muscle to get them into their holes in the frame . this might be a drawback for someone who is weak in the arms . it folds up easy and is very portable . also , i have a smaller frame , and although this cot is perfect for me , a larger frame person might want to consider a wider version for comfort in the shoulder area . you wo n't be disappointed in this one for the money
sports	this thing is great - my wife put it together in half an hour and she 's an idiot . nonetheless it is very solid . as a long time alcoholic i have a hard time getting up and a harder time going up and down stairs or walking in the grocery store , etc . because this thing is low i can have the tv on , a drink on the floor on one side and my cigarettes on the floor on the other side and can reach them both while i pedal ! i did 1 mile the first day at medium drag ( despite what other reviewers have said there is a huge difference in drag between settings ) , 2 miles the second and am up to 5 miles per day now - now i can drive my car to the store because my legs work again - this thing is really good . plus it 's silent - dropping two ice cubes in a glass makes more noise as does lighting a bic lighter . but it is made in china ... note : shipping was free and it came in just a couple of days
sports	we bought this for our 2 year old daughter . it was a nightmare to put together , then it did not fit . becareful when installing in larger mountain bikes . we bought a 20inch frame , men 's mountain mike and it was 3 inches too short of fitting . not worth it ! !
sports	mfg by northpole ltd , this roomy chair features padded seat and back for additional comfort . seating position is leaned back , lacking adjustment for more upright seating . fabric appears to be a durable rip stop nylon . the arms are padded with foam , and i question foam durability over the long haul . the chair could benefit from the addition of a cup holder . chair is rated at 225 pounds , and is close to 4 feet in length when folded and in its carry bag . nfl team logo is embroidered on front and back of seat back and looks sharp . team name and logo is also printed on carry bag . overall , a comfortable , well constructed chair ( with exceptions as noted ) with an eye catching logo of your favorite team
sports	i just read the other reviewer 's comments . yes , the bag is n't huge , but it certainly gets the job done . it 's not the over-sized bag where you can stuff 6 full sized textbooks , but it 's a bag that has style . that 's why i got it . it 's a bit more european in its design , and is of good quality . i dont expect zippers to break anytime soon . look to be good quality . also , at this price -- it is such a good deal
sports	i never found the fork part of a spork to be very useful . now we have this light my fire spork , and i have to wonder why nobody thought of this before ! nearly perfect for typical backpacker meals - probably mre 's too . if you 've a friend or relative `` over there '' , send 'em one
sports	i ordered it for christmas but i did n't get it until december 27th . it 's now in a closet waiting for another gift-giving occassion
sports	if you search for the keyword 'illuminator led flashlight ' , you 'll find that this same item is offered from varies sources at wildly different prices . so naturally , you should just go for the lowest price , right ? not so fast ... i already bought one illuminator flashlight elsewhere ( see my `` customer images ' above ) , and was going to order a few more as gifts . the lowest price i found here is from 'iggfactory handhelditems ' at $ 7.95 . but during checkout , i found out that their standard shipping and handling fee is $ 8.21 for just one item . the flashlight itself weights only 7 oz. , but the company charges 4 lb . for shipping weight . what a rip-off ! with such inflated shipping cost , you may be better off buying this item from local drug stores ( such as walgreen ) for $ 15 . at least there you can return the item easily if you 're not happy with it . [ update on jan 21 , 2007 ] : please check out my review for the garrity power lite , where i have made a comparison betweeen it and the illuminator . it is my opinion that the garrity is a better flashlight .
sports	i purchased a new 26 '' men 's huffy cranbrook cruiser bike . after assembly , to my surprise the rear wheel would not inflate because of a bad inner tube . so what do you do , disassemble and return ? no , call huffy and they take you through nine hoops . finally they sent me the right part which took ten days , and i took the bike to a local fix it shop which charged me $ 15 labor to fix the rear wheel . no savings ! p.s . the bike is a piece of junk made in china . the instruction manual is nearly useless
