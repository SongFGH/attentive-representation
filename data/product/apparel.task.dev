1	i was pleased with all purchase . i did not feel that i was given enough consideration on shipping costs as a very old and loyal customer . in addition for reasons that are not clear to me , i continue to get duplicate orders , or the order is sent to an old address . the return process in this circumstance is cumbersome and communicating with you and receiving a cogent response is quite difficul
0	i am in great shape . however , i can not get over that so many men 's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension . obviously they are made in china where the average waist is about 25 inches . the idea of `` medium '' as marketed is ridiculous by healthy american standards . my body fat is low . i am not profoundly muscular bound . as is common in men of my age , lower back problems are not unusual . i have a 32 '' waist . is that not `` medium '' sized ? i think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether . one size fits all does n't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems . the draw string is fine . it allows flexibility . so what if your pants fall down ? it seems to be the fashion , anyway . just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary , uncontrollable constrictions . also , these boxers do n't hold up well to any kind of washing . they looked like crap after the first time i washed them . i wish i could get a refund because i wo n't wear them again . my life partner told me they looked like `` old men 's '' underwear . that is sad and embarrassing because i agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry . i am not a mean hearted kind of guy . so , i am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again .
1	the service was expedient and the bras fit perfectly . just what i expected and wanted
0	i bought these shoes to do aerobics in . they look good and are comfortable , but only to walk in . there is zero arch support and when i walk in them i feel as if my feet are flat on the ground . there is zero shock absorption and no cushion for doing aerobics . my old shoes that are 8 months old has triple the cusion of these new ones , but i ca n't use the old ones . the gym on the base here do not allow dirty shoes . they are 8 months dirty full of sand and dirt . i am really let down over this as it took me three weeks to have them delivered to my remote location . now i have to look again
1	there are n't many articles of clothing that allow people to support their favorite team , as well as appear smart and sexy at the same time . red sox hats , however , are just such an item . go sox
1	fits great on my ipod nano . does not slip off like other silicone covers . pretty durable and great protective piece for the nano . con : do plastic cover or protection for the screen
1	i bought these slippers as a christams gift for my 16 year old daughter , she was very happy to get them as i guess they are the `` in '' thing for teenagers in her school . she loves them and actually wears them to school they are so comfy ! price is high , but they are well made and will last much longer than the typical slipper , these are more like shoes than slippers . the sheep skin wool lining is very sturdy luxerious
0	the fast delivery and reasonable price for these shoes almost make me ignore the not so perfect pair of shoes i received . they look like some floor model and somewhat tried on with part of the heels on both shoes cut off resembling rejects . i am sure i will not show them off much when i wear them
1	i bought these for my son for christmas , they were first quality , arrived in time for christmas , and at a great price
1	this shirt is a dressier than the usual shirt jacket or big shirt . it is unlined , has a bit of stretch for comfort , and is just slightly fitted to prevent that big blob shapelessness of some other courduroy shirts . i think it runs true to size and matches the color on-screen . i bought this as a gift for a friend who likes the comfort of big shirts in the winter , and maybe she can have that comfort even at work with this shirt . it was almost thirteen dollars then , but i have seen it for less than ten which would be a really good deal
1	at first i had my heart set on a different cloak , but when it was no longer available i decided to go with this one . i am very pleased that i was not disappointed . this cloak looks and feels beautiful . it has a nice button closure at the neck , and for those that are petite it is floor length . this cloak is just what i was looking for to add a last minute touch to my halloween costume . it is very comfortable and soft , no itchy feel here
0	i got the largest size they had ( size 10 ) and my toes were crunched in . they fit my mom just barely , and she 's a size 8. i wanted to get my money back for it , but it 'd probably be more money just to ship the incredibly small slippers back , then it actually costed to begin with .
1	the product was as advertised and delivered on time
1	this item was a great buy , fast delivery and was given as a gift ... thank
1	like wearing a moccasin only with more support . more supple than most driving shoes , and light weight too . soles wear very well , as do uppers . a great looking shoe that has become my favorite knocking around shoe , yet plenty dressy for evenings eating out in southern cal
0	beware , this item is not a zip front hoodie as the item description says . it is a pullover !
1	this is a very sexy pair of underwear . guys : if you 're new to the thong/g-string scene , this is a good place to start . i recommend g-strings because there 's less coverage on the back which makes them more comfortable than thongs . the reason i did n't give it 5 stars is because it 's pretty expensive but go ahead and splurge on one fancy pair of underwear . your girlfriend will love it . mine did
1	i love these shoes , they are so comfortable and give great support . these are my second pair . the merchant got them to me really fast and i appreciate that . though when i ordered i thought the amazon site specified free shipping so i was surprised at that
1	i love these shoes and so does everyone who sees me in them . i am the envy of the girls at work
0	one of the pairs of magnets that is supposed to keep the flap closed are oriented in such a way that the same polarity face each other . genius ! not . the result - the flap would not close and leave a gap that just keep on repelling each other . grrr ... one more thing , only the screen is protected by a clear plastic . the wheel is not
1	these are my single favorite pair of underwear . not your typical jock but much more comfortable and stylish . i 'm in the military so at first i thought `` thongs are not for `` real men '' but after wearing these i found they are , and a lot more guys wear thongs and jocks than you realize . i wear these for every day activivties , sports , work , and leisure . there is n't much fabric so they 're great under jeans and my girlfriend thinks there sooo sexy . after wearing them for a while it 's like nothing is there because they support you only where you need it . if you 've never owned a thong , i think you should give these a shot.i definately recomend the 2xist y back thong
1	not only are these shoes great looking on ... they are extremely comfortable . i went back and bought two addtional pairs in different colors
0	i purchased this scarf as a christmas present for my daughter-in-law . it was so cheap and thin it was mailed to me folded up in a 9 x 12 envelope . i had to go out at the last minute and purchase a scarf at a department store . i would have been embarrassed to give her the pashmina scarf . it was a wasted of money
0	these look and feel good but the little nobs do break off pretty quick , ruining the shoes completely . do not buy them .
1	this is a beautiful shoe by rockport , but beware , it runs really narrow . i even went a size up from my usual to compensate . i ended-up sending them back anyway . so if your foot is on the narrow side you may enjoy this sandal
0	the jacket is cut undersized , typical of foreign makes with poor quality control . the lining in the sleeve keeps coming ot at the wrist which interferes with activity . exterior shell has nice feel , but overall , a poor piece of work
1	this is a very nice leather bag . it has two pockets in the front that the flap goes over . the pockets do not close and i have found that you can lose things out of those pockets even with the flap closed . that is the only problem i can see with this bag
1	these black satin isotoner slippers are extremely comfortable and fit extremely well . they are flexible enough to mold to the shape of your feet but strong enough to cushion your feet , as well . they are well worth the purchase
0	nice looking picture but what are the dementions of the thing ? it looks good but is it 4 '' x 8 '' or 12 '' x 8 '' ? sure would be nice to know the size before i buy ... ... ... ... . da trol
1	if you have the body to show for it , by all means wear it alone
0	turn around time to receive item was good . material of the shirt was sub-par ( very thin ) for the price .
1	very nice sandal , lookes great with a dress or jeans . low enough to wear for hours at a time , but high enough heel to make it look chic
0	i purchased this skin to accompany my daughter 's new mp3 player . we managed to tear the skin first thing out of the box even though we were being careful , or so we thought . i expected higher durablity
1	i love birkenstocks and when i saw the eaton clog at such a low price , well , say no more . once you know your size , you can buy birkenstocks from anywhere . i just never expected to find them on amazon.com . they 're a little dressier style than my usual bostons and i just love them
1	i love this bag ! i purchased the pink/chocolate color and i get alot of compliments on how cute it is . i am in my early 20 's and i have a 2 and half year old and this bag can hold what i need for him as well as my things and still not look bulky or overstuffed and at the same time , is very stylish . i really like those trendy baby bags for those young moms , but they are very expensive . this is lightweight , made of cotton , so very easy to clean . i chose standard shipping and it came so quickly . i am very satisfied with my purchase
0	i ordered 4 toddler long-sleeved tees ' in the same size , i thought . when i received the shipment , all 4 tees ' were different sizes [ even though they were all labeled the same size ] . i have returned the items since the tees ' run two sizes too small , and the workmanship is questionable , which translates into ... that i will not be able to give this item to my loved one for christmas .
1	this swim jock is a great all around jock . very durable and very comfortable pouch and straps . mine has taken a beating , and has not fallen apart like other jocks i own . the swim style is cut very low in front , with a fairly small pouch . not only is it great for working out under your workout pants or shorts , it actually turns out to be a very sexy pair of underwear for everyday or play . the low rise cut pairs very well with low rise jeans , not to mention the barely there skimpy factor . heat it up a little and try this jock under your low cut jeans ... ..looks and feels hot ! if you 're looking for a jock with less coverage and a lower waistband or just a comfortable sexy pair of underwear , this jock is a great buy for the price .
1	was delivered quickly , was priced right , and folded up into a small size so i could stuff it into a suitcase before going on vacation . when unfolded it held more than the suitcase . high quality material and excellent workmanship . i think i 'll buy another one for a spare
1	this is the most comfortable sports shoe that i have worn and i own just about every brand made
0	you can use this case for storage which is what i do now . it does n't allow me to click the buttons , the bottom two since it squeezes it already and it 's down so i ca n't access them . overall , it 's ok for just keeping your player in there . i really recommend an invisible shield , it works better than this case for sure . this case is a bit bulky , but it 's alright if you do n't mind taking the player out to press the buttons to change songs and put it back in . sometimes when you put it back in , it will accidentally press one of the buttons which can be annoying and pretty much is . basically , if you want a case to keep it in this is n't too bad , but another product is better for sure . either my case was jinxed or they are all like that .
0	i bought these for my younger than three month old son , he did n't even move around alot and in the morning the fabric that the snaps are attached to would be ripped off from the shirt . i ended up having to throw them all away or keep sewing them back together . i do not suggest that anyone buy these
0	on sept 17 i ordered a cashmere wrap . i finally got the company 's attention when i placed a negative review on this forum . i was told if i removed the review after recieving the item , i would be credited for shipping . the item arrived oct 16 . as of today , november 20 , my credit card had not been credited . i emailed the company and was told the credit should appear in four to five days .
0	the bought 3 polar fleece caps and they are all one size fits all , but either i have a big head or something becuase it does n't cover my ears all the way . as for my husband that actually has a small head it fits him fine . so i guess if you have a big head do n't get it becuase it will not cover your ears .
1	i love this umbrella . it 's just the right size and works perfectly . it 's so pretty that i do n't want to get it wet ! !
0	this is a very styling money clip , however , it is not like a big paper clip . it opens like a butterfly , then closes together with the strenght of the magnets . it feels that your money and other cards might fall off . i 'm not sure if the magnet could wipe of your credit card information
1	after all these years buying this wrangler product this by far has been the cheaper price that i 've ran across . i love it .
1	i bought these for my husband and he loves them . they 're well made and super comfortable . he liked them so much he bought another pair in a different color . highly recommended
0	the robe does not fit me . i wanted to return it , got a return item number , got busy , and did not get it in the mail soon enough . they have a strict 30 day return ploicy . nordstroms does not do this . i could exchange it there . sorry i got a job and not time for petty rules . i will go elsewhere next time
0	i was very disappointed with this bra . i would definately not recommend it . if you are looking for a good and supportive nursing bra try the maternelle bra instead . this bra looks sexy , but does not offer the support and coverage needed for a nursing bra ( at least not for a size 38dd )
1	this is a wonderfully comfortable and good looking pump especially if you 're looking for a slightly wider toe box . it looks great with a skirt or slacks . my only complaint is that after finally accepting that a wide width is the most comfortable , and kindest to my feet , i ca n't find my size ( 6.5 w ) in navy . i have the shoe in black . if anyone from naturalizer is reading this message ; how about making more sizes and colors in wide widths available
0	this bag is so cheap looking i am embarrassed to use it . when i saw it online it looked identical to a us luggage bag i bought at tj maxx , which was stolen . so , i was very excited to find what i thought was the same bag on amazon to replace it . when i got it , i was shocked at how cheap it looks . the handles especially are plastic leather and just hideous . the return policy through ebags is such a hassle that i am just going to keep it and use it for bringing my laptop to and from work , but i will still need to find a better travel laptop bag . i 'm very disappointed . if you 're looking for a professional looking laptop bag , this is n't it . i should have known better for the price , but like i said , i thought it was the same as the other us luggage bag i had , which was gorgeous and i loved it . oh well .
0	this is an okay jacket . the padding in it is okay . sizes tend to run a little smaller than normal . there is no liner , and you will get cold riding at night . overall the jacket has only 2 layers , and if you hold it in front of you you can see through the mesh . spend a little bit more and get something that will hold up
0	i ordered a pair and they were too big ... so when i asked for a rma number to return and get a smaller pair they said they could only snail mail me a ups lable ... one month later it did not come ... each time to emailed customer services they said they could only smail mail it and not email it to me ... . whereas i know it is do-able.. bargain outfitters can as well as can online shoes .. so finally i paid $ 15 to send the boots back . on my dine.. and no doubt they will not reimburse me for my $ .. i not only had to pay shipping to get the boots but also they will no doubt chaarge me a re-stocking fee . i will never ever buy from the sportsman 's guide again ...
0	after wearing the betula birkenstocks for about an hour , the snap button kept coming undone near the buckle . happened pretty much every 10 minutes when i walked . midwest wont take them back since i wore them .
0	apparently there is an error in the item description . these are not gore-tex and are just about as waterproof as a seive . i new they probably were not waterproof when i put them on and saw my socks through the mesh upper but desided to test them out anyway ... stupid me .
0	i bought this as a surprise for my wife . when we opened it , i thought that 1 ) we were shipped a pillowcase by mistake or 2 ) they had n't finished it . edges are raw and unfinished . it is a complete waste of money because returning it will mean that the shipping both directions will cost me more than the dress cost . i understand that `` you get what you pay for , '' but this was a piece of garbage . this dress in the picture is obviously pinned and pulled back to give it any shape whatsoever . the picture does not accurately represent this item at all . this will fit like a potato sack , folks . i notice that the `` raw edges '' are now listed as a `` feature . '' ahem . in a recent e-mail exchange with them , i was told that ( their words now ) : `` quality is a subjective issue . '' they have pestered me to change my feedback and i have challenged them three times now to point out any inaccuracies in my feedback , and i would absolutely recant them . in their defense : my money has now been refunded . now ... anybody want to buy a pillowcase with three holes in it , worn for 90 seconds ? it would have been off sooner , but my wife was laughing too hard to get it back over her head . wish i could rate as a `` zero
0	ordered gray , they shipped black . since it is from canada i 'm not even going to waste return shipping charges . minor inconvenience , yet still folks , i ordered gray ! pants are also not new , the tags are ripped and torn , it looks like return or wholesale merchandise . i feel cheated , angry , but mostly just disappointed . for shame people , for ... .shame ... .
1	these are so great , and keep my baby 's feet warm . she even slept with them on with no problem . she 's been a master at getting her socks off up until now . they also protect her feet as she is starting to stand and was breaking toenails . she 's chewing on the toes but i have n't seen any scuff marks yet , so they are holding up very well
0	i bought this dress because i thought it looked so good on the model in the photo , but i should have taken into consideration i couldnt see the front . the boobs on the dress were very weird and pointy , and the ties up the back looked awful . it might be good for someone with a different figure than mine , but i think my boyfriend would have been more amused than aroused if he had seen me in it
1	ordering was easy , arrived in 4 days , gloves fit , well and good quality , good buy , recommend to purchas
1	my baby is large for her age and wears 6-9 month sized clothes even though she is only 3 months old . i ordered two of these hats sized 6-12 months . they are way too big for my baby but will probably fit her when she is actually 6 months . hats are made of t-shirt fabric and look just like the picture . you do have to tie your own knot on the top . andrew christian sent each hat in a separate envelope and they arrived on different days , but within the shipping time specified
1	i 've got really sensitive feet and i get blisters really easily , sometimes within 5mins of wearing a new pair of shoes . my quest for the comfortable ballet flat has ended here , after months of searching ! the heel is nice and soft but there 's still sufficient support here ( for me that is . for those of you out there with back problems , it might not be sufficient ) . i got them in the gold , which is a gorgeous pale lame , and am currently lusting over the black :
0	i was informed in october that the item was no longer available and my account would be credited . i think maybe i should check my bank statement for that time
0	i am in great shape . however , i can not get over that so many men 's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension . obviously they are made in china where the average waist is about 25 inches . the idea of `` medium '' as marketed is ridiculous by healthy american standards . my body fat is low . i am not profoundly muscular bound . as is common in men of my age , lower back problems are not unusual . i have a 32 '' waist . is that not `` medium '' sized ? i think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether . one size fits all does n't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems . the draw string is fine . it allows flexibility . so what if your pants fall down ? it seems to be the fashion , anyway . just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary , uncontrollable constrictions . also , these boxers do n't hold up well to any kind of washing . they looked like crap after the first time i washed them . i wish i could get a refund because i wo n't wear them again . my life partner told me they looked like `` old men 's '' underwear . that is sad and embarrassing because i agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry . i am not a mean hearted kind of guy . so , i am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again .
1	i 've been buying these sandals for 30 years . i just love them
1	this is a well made rugged coat . sort of a north face/ mountain hardware coat for the farm/ ranch . not a summer coat too heavy ! ! ! the next model needs to have pit zips !
0	this hat is not suitable for a small child . it is way too big and the material it is made of is too hard and stiff . if i had been there when it arrived , i would have sent it back
0	even for only $ 12 , these were n't worth the money . they came smelling extremely strongly of turpentine , or some other noxious chemical and now , at least 2 months since i have received them , the smell has not dissipated . they are extremely stiff , so even if they did n't reek , i still would n't wear them b/c my feet would be in tatters by mid-day . i guess that 's what i get for buying cheap shoes
0	i purchased these sandals thinking they would be comfortable and because they looked like they were made of leather . they are more like a vinyl material and are stiff and not attractive . they will be returned .
1	love these little gems ... perfect at 1 size below normal size . you wo n't want to take them off
1	these shoes are so comfortable and cute ! i 've gotten a lot of compliments on them , and i like their old-school pony look
0	i want to start by saying fred flare- shipped this product very fast ! ! and the transaction itself was very smooth . i do however , have extreme problems with the product itself . the product is not leather , its nylon , and it sort of looks cheap ? the inside material is sued , but that 's only the lining for the base of the wallet . also , the wallet part is very hard to use . you cant really put too much in the wallet- the credit card slots are a little too snug , and there is no place for my i.d . the wallet included a small `` note book '' but it also does n't fit in the wallet ? i was very excited about this product , but now i feel duped . the pictures made the wallet seem like it was of higher quality , and that it was user friendly , but it 's not . i do not recommend this product
0	would love to order these , but sizes are not clear . does small fit a toddler , is small a size 7 ? not sure how to order .
0	i ordered this wool wrap at the beginning of december and never received the item . i am disappointed that this seller is ripping people off and plan to report the fact that my money was basically stolen from me . if people ca n't be honest in their transactions then online buying will eventually die out . two thumbs down
0	not as expected , too short , nothing special for the price - took forever to receive ( about 3 weeks
0	i love vanity fair . their bras just fit me perfectly . when this bra arrived i quickly found it was not vanity fair . not only that , but it was made of the most rough and uncomfortable material . i tried it on in hopes it may fit . it was the most uncomfortable bra i have ever tried on . not because of size . it was bulky , rough and obviously inexpensively made . the tag said something along the lines of , `` made in hong kong .
0	i have yet to reccived tham so i can not review tham till i reccive them . thank you , robert but
1	my daughter 's school requires that they where white knee highs with their uniform . i had an awful time searching the net to find any until i came across these . they are very soft and comfortable . my daughter only wants these types of socks from now on . but from a mom 's point of view they are hard to keep white . even with soaking in bleach i ca n't get out any of the foot wear and tear discoloring . other than that , they 're great
1	recently , i took a motorcycle trip from atlanta , ga to ft. lauderdale , fl . unfortunately , i did n't have the option of riding at night when it was cooler and with my thermometer on the bike showing between 100 and 110 , it felt like riding through an oven with a hair dryer set on high blowing in my face . i also did n't have the luxury of air conditioning so to simulate this so i would pour water on my t-shirt and let the wind cool it down . after getting home , i recalled seeing a demonstration of a cooling vest that you soaked in water for a couple of minutes then wore under a jacket , preferrably mesh . i was amazed at how well it worked in the demo so i went online and ordered one . the particular model i ordered from amazon is the deluxe evaporative cooling vest in black . it came about a week after i ordered it via usps priority mail . they offer several styles and colors , including some that have removable sleeves the outer shell is quilted black nylon with 2 outside , zippered pockets and a zipper up the front . the neck has a velcro closure so it can fit snuggly around your neck if you want . the inner liner is blue and is 100 % nylon taslan , a water repellant fabric , so it keeps you from getting all wet wearing it . out of the package , it weighs just a few ounces but when you put it in water , the special material , called polymer embedded fabric ( pef ) , between the inner and outer shells absorbs water and the vest ends up weighing about 2-3 lbs . you only need to soak it for about a minute . there are spandex panels on either side that allow for some for expansion . i got the large size and it fits great , not too tight , not too loose . once the water is absorbed , the instructions ( on the tag in the vest ) say you can wring it out or use a towel to blot the inner liner dry . not being like a sponge , wringing it does n't do a lot of good so i 'd suggest blotting if you need to . while the inner liner is water repellant , there might be some water on it right after you soak it so putting it on might get you a little wet but if you do n't soak it too long , the inner liner will be relatively dry . the material that holds the water does n't expand like a sponge , it just holds lots of water ... it 's pretty interesting stuff . the first thing you 'll notice after a few seconds is that it 's cool to the touch . the principle of it relies on the cooling properties of water as it evaporates and it really works . i have n't had a chance to ride with it in sweltering heat yet , but putting it on under my mesh jacket and riding without a windshield kept me nice and cool . i do n't think i 'd like to try it in anything less than about 65 deg ( f ) because i 'd probably freeze nor would i want to use it under a leather jacket unless there was some way for the jacket to let wind flow through it . the inner liner stays pretty dry but you might get a little damp . the cooling effect will last several hours depending on how long you soak it and if you want to put things in the front pockets , they are lined with the same material as the inner liner so they 'll stay relatively dry . one thing i 've found though , it 'll take several days to completely dry out unless you ride with it . the water is very slow to evaporate but once it does , the weight goes back down to a few ounces . bottom line , i highly recommend getting one of these if you routinely ride in hot weather . they 're an inexpensive way to keep cool and they 're stylish ( except for the hi-vis lime green ) . wear it under a mesh jacket and you wo n't know it 's hot outside .
0	the other reviewer is spot on . these are pretty ( but not truly mirrored ) and they broke after only 4 weeks use . i bought a pair of aviators at a gas station that was made of much sturdier materials for half the price . definitely not worth the $ 16
0	these pants were washed one time , following the washing instructions , they were not put in the dryer , and they shrunk not only around , but lengthwise . i had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and did n't have any problems . i look forward to your reply
0	i had this bag on my wishlist and got it for christmas . i wanted it for when i take daytrips to the beach . i am really disappointed with the size . it 's pretty deep , but not very wide at all . no way i 'll be able to take everything i need to the beach in this bag . still , i 'll be able to use it for other things
1	my mother loves these pants . i know they are for men , but she loves the way they fit her . they are stain resisnt and that makes them that much better .
1	my husband thought this was a great shirt as an avid golfer .
0	i have ordered this coat 2 times and returned both coats . i 'm very disappointed . this is supposed to be a reversible coat . however , the hem of the black side is too long . consequently it hangs below the hem of the bronze side when reversed . and , it does not look good at all . the company needs to revise this pattern
1	this is the the most comfortable and motion limiting sports bra ever . i highly recommend it
0	these pants did not look good on me . they seem built for thin people . while not obese , i am not a stick figure either and these just did not flatter me . the material is nice , though
0	and no customer service on weekends at even before xmas
1	these are great socks . in the description it mentions that they fit sock sizes 10-13 . i assume that is the same as shoe size , but it is not explained . this , however , is an important point , since i wear a size 10 shoe . i can wear the socks and i really like them but i wish they were a little smaller . one size does not fit all .
1	nice , soft leatherette . the inside is roomy , and the pic is fairly accurate for the size to body ratio . the tie-front detail stays so , you do n't have to worry about it unraveling or loosening . nice silver buckle accents on strap . great
1	the presentation of the product is claer and attractive and the product is durable , comfortable and goodlooking
0	i ordered what should be my size and what is my size in all my other lingerie . there 's there 's zero stretch in this , it was difficult to get the panties over the hips and then the waist is big . since they 're short from crotch to waist anyway , it does n't much matter . the top fits better , since you adjust it . the cut is still quite poor and , again , there 's no give to the silk so it feels tight across the shoulders . it 's one thing for lingerie to be snug in the hips or bust . it 's another when the cut is so bad that the shoulders are a problem . if you 're narrow through the hips , shoulders or bust , this combo will probably be a nice fit . if you 're curvy , you might want to rethink this . it 's a shame since it comes in plus sizes . maybe i should have ordered up about two sizes but it should have been better made and a truer fit imo
1	arrived fast and in time for v-day ! thanks for your high quality product and its fast arrival
1	i love my soft and comfortable green robe that i received last year for mother 's day ! whenever i wear it , i want to just relax with a magazine or watch tv , and then fall asleep in it . the matching green slippers complete the feel , and i really feel pampered . i never knew i could feel so good wearing a robe , especially since i was not really a robe wearer before receiving this wonderful plush robe ! this is such an excellent product and great gift !
1	this is the best brand of slippers i have ever owned ! i have a cute pink pair that i slip into the minute i get home . they have lasted for several years now , and they are still in good shape . these slippers are so comfortable , and they stay on my feet without any effort . they are very soft and keep my feet plenty warm , and my feet never sweat in them , even without socks ! this style runs large , and i wear a 1/2 size smaller than my normal shoe size in these slippers . after wearing them the first week , i noticed they got a little roomier , but they still stay on just fine . they are my only pair of house shoes at the moment . i just ordered a new pair in a different style ( in pink , of course ) , and i have no doubt they will be just as good as this pair was to me . try dearfoams and your feet will thank you
0	this coat was listed as camel , but when it arrived it was actually tan . even the tag says tan . i was disappointed because it was the only christmas gift that i had for my husband . i never would have ordered a tan . also the coat fit like a whole size larger . i had to return it and it has been well over a month and i still have not received my refund
0	i bought these slippers as a present for my husband for christmas . i ca n't return them because he wore them for a day . these slippers were so badly made that he is wearing his old slippers . the shape of the sole on the right foot is the same as the left . do n't waste your money
1	shoe pretty true to size , good shoe for the money . i buy nike shox often and decided to try these for the price . not as cushy as a nike shox but also half the cost or less ! for the price it is a comfy shoe and i would recommend it if you have wider feet and or do n't want to send $ 90.00 and up for shox
0	i am still waiting for a credit to my credit card account . the item was not available and they said i would be credited . still waiting !
0	this shoe looked nice and stylish , but turned out to be very narrow ( even though i 've ordered it in size wide ! ! ! ) and uncomfortable . also had some glue marks on it -- i had to return it
0	i have done a review on these socks already , which has not appeared . they are not a good buy
1	just got them in the mail today . as other kenneth cole reaction shoes , it runs one size larger . i 'm usually a 12 but i ordered an 11 and they fit just right . these boots look great with jeans . the color is a bit darker than the one shown in the photograph .
0	i purchased two of these sports bras based on brand , price , and product description . this is a very uncomfortable bra for runners . the seams chafe and it does not `` wick away moisture . '' the slow shipping did n't help my opinion either . it is a nice bra for less active endeavors .
1	i ordered this boot in a size 7 , pewter . very cute boot and fits perfectly . very comfortable fit and feel . everyone who saw them wanted to know where i got them ! simply darling boot
1	i was unable to find my size in local stores and located this product on amazon for less than $ 30 , retail price , even on sale , was $ 60 . the jacket arrived in about a week . its nice and warm , very good quality . the upper torso/shoulders and elbow patches are covered in a heavy nylon which repels water and will help it hold up to wear and tear . it fits great and looks good . only small complaint is the elastic draw string around the bottom which cinches at the side and is a bit too long so it sticks out a little . but all in all i 'm very pleased
1	my baby loves his new kicks ! ! they came quick and would recomend them to anyone
1	hesitantly , i ordered my first pair of folk readers ; now i 'm back for a second pair . they 're comfortable , unique , well-crafted and the company offers excellent service - a winner
0	too bad there was n't a rating of 0 star . this is the worst piece of junk i ever bought . first of all we were looking for a brand called sports afield . this item fell under it when we did a search . when it arrived it was some off the wall brand.they were paper thin but thought maybe they were warm being it was from an army and navy store . wrong ! ! ! ! ! ! ! they served no purpose at all.were not warm at all . .we washed them per directios on tag and shrunk so bad i do n't think a 2 yr old could fit in them.do not buy ! ! ! ! ! ! jun
1	i like this fragance and the shipment was awsome , i did n't know what they supose to be here and when i check de tracking it was like delivered and i check my mail and it was there ! awsome awsome awsom
1	not very pretty but the comfort makes up for that . i am on my feet all day and used to wear reeboks , nike etc , i decided to try the crocs and have not gone back ! ! ! its like walking with slippers on . i have been wearing them for about 7 months or so and just recently tried my tennis shoes again and barely made it through the day . by that night my feet and back were hurting so bad i didnt want to do much but sit down . right then and there i made up my mind to never go back to tennis shoes again ! ! ! i do wish they were a little cheaper so i could add all the colors to my wardrobe . buy them you wont be sorry ! ! stay away from the look a likes they are nothing like the original crocs in comfort !
1	i got my adidas adissage wht/pnk sandals in record time . i was able to take them on my trip with me as intended . also , the price was the best that i had seen on the internet .
0	the elastic in these shoes makes them too uncomfortable to wear . otherwise , the quality of the lace shoes is good . i 'd wear them if the elastic did n't dig into my foot ( i have small feet too ! )
1	i was asked by my daughter to get these for christmas . i got some for myself for my morning walks in -30c temps . they do not muss up my hair for the rest of the day , even when i have just gotten it done , and keep my ears toasty warm . great product and worth the money . my daughter is equally impressed .
1	this is a great item to have if you are loosing weight . you can adjust the belt as needed without having to buy new ones
0	i ordered these white tank tops and 3 colored tank tops . i have never received these white tank tops and have requested a refund and requested another size they had in stock and have received neither . i have sent emails requesting this and still no resolve
0	company sent me two of one shirt and this shirt . i ordered 3 different shirts . this shirt is large in size but very short ! not what i had expected . asked the company to fix the problem with the shirts as they were christmas gifts for my daughter . i received a fill form two weeks later with no correction to the problem .
0	i 'm just not too crazy about this thing . does n't quite fit right or look right ... at least i only paid 5 bucks..
0	the cheaper variety at walmart ( $ 8.92 versus $ 19 and up ) , no boundaries brand , is better for me due to the fact that they are harder and more firm , more like a birkenstock cork sole which i also find very comfortable , for me anyway . they do last longer too and are not affected by heat in any way . walmart also has a real color explosion going on . you can get some really wild color combinations which give the shoe have a little personality for those occasions when you feel the need to express yourself . so , for the cheaper price walmart offers , i feel the value and quality exceeds the more expensive brands out there . if you are looking for a firm birkestock type sole , the no boundaries brand croc is a shoe-in , no pun intended .
0	when i purchased this , i was under the false impression that the idea of a silicon skin was to provide the unit with some shock protection in the event that it were to get dropped . the skin is so thin , that it does nothing but keep a little bit of dust off of the buttons . the belt clip is made of brittle plastic and broke the second day that i used it . do n't waste your money , spend the extra bucks to get something that will last a while .
0	the pajamas are way to long . they look like they were made for someone 7 feet tall
0	these socks are okay , but after one wash , they were covered with so much fuzz and didnt look good . so the next pair i washed it with hand and dried alone to avoid the fuzz . also they are too warm socks
0	are customers to guess what is a `` small '' size compared to a `` large size ? '' is the small for a todder , pre-schooler or teenager ? what a waste of time trying to find information on this web-site about the sizes .
0	i am ex us army , national guard and army reserve . i did not expect to receive dress web belts made in china and taiwan from an army navy store . i have other belts made in usa that are heavier materials ( belt and buckle ) . the belts have lasted 10 to 12 years and the buckles are still good as new ! i ordered 3 belts with buckles thinking i would not need to buy a new belt for the rest of my life . the web material is very thin for a belt . the buckles 2 out of 3 are stamped made in taiwan and the 3rd has a sticker says made in china . they are cheaply made and are likely to break or snag clothing . i will not recommend this product to anybody . after shipping this junk cost me $ 47.00 !
0	i am a 38 ff , and i was hoping this would help hold me in while running - not ! this bra is no better than my 18 hour bras and is double the price ! i 'm still in search of the bra that will hold me in ! this one is going back
0	i bought this bra because the ad says 100 % cotton . there is no cotton in this bra . it is 86 % nylon and 14 % elastane . if you want a cotton bra , this is not for you
1	i was very satisfied with my purchase of these items.reasonable price and am very happy with items
0	easy to install . we used it for less than a month and it no longer rotates- you can still hear the engine running , but no movement . hardly any use at all- maybe 10 times . we tried taking it apart to see if something simple was wrong and the screws are set so tight you ca n't open it to see the inner workings . i have never received a bad item from amazon before- i am very disappointed with this product .
1	every time i wear this tie , it always strikes up a good conversation of the way things were , and when cartoons were cartoons . also working in a place with a lot of kids , they tend to be more at ease when they see me with this on . i 've had this tie for 3 years now , high quality , and does not stain really easy ( at least for me , great quality ) . only downfall , a little dated with a 32 cent stamp . kids do n't notice , and neither do most adults . worth picking up , great price
1	purchased these for my husband . he absolutely loves these sandals . he initially thought the little nubbies would feel strange . however , he got over that thought fast when he slipped them on and went tromping around the yard . he uses them for a quick slip-on shoe to run outdoors . wears them every day . thanks for a nice slip-on ! also these are sturdy though very light weight
1	i 'm the type of guy who has never bothered to buy slippers . i run around the house in socks . i 'm getting a little older now and my feet seem to get cold , plus i run outside to do quick things like grab something from my shop , turn on the water for a tree or plant , etc ... things that normally require me to slip on some shoes . these slippers are very soft , but have a substantial enough sole to step a few steps outside without worry . the light color and porous surface do tend to stain easily however , but so far i 've managed to wash off the toothpaste drips and such ( laugh with me ) . yes i 'd recommend them for now and will let you know later how they held up
0	i returned this bra to exchange for size the day after i received it in october . it is now january and i have not yet received the replacement . i have called several times but to no avail ! i ca n't give a good review of this product because i have n't actually gotten to wear the bra
1	soft , durable , breathable fabric . perfectly flexible for vigorous practice . i 'm glad i bought these
0	really uncomfortable . i wore them twice and then threw them out . they sagged like a sad pair of tights you used to wear when you were little . and they became transparent like they were going to rip at any moment . not worth the $ 5 i paid
0	i bought this wallet for my niece and then ended up returning it . the quality is poor . the wallet is really hard to use because the compartments do not open all the way . also , the wallet actually looked fake ( not sure if it is ) because the xoxo is upside down . you can not tell from looking at the picture .
1	these boots are gorgeous ! i got such an awesome deal on these boots ; i searched online for about an hour to find another website that has a picture of them ! i 'll put one up here . they 're comfy , rich leather , well made . i 've always wanted frye boots
1	i love the shoes , very comfortable and i can wear them with just about anything
0	boots run about a size too big and unfortunately it cost $ 20 to return/exchange
1	very smooth transaction and timely delivery . first time on-line shoe buyer . i tried those cute shoes on at a local shoe store and loved them but was not willing to pay high price for them . i saved about 35 % by purchasing here !
1	i love these shoes ! they are so comfy and look good . the price is a bit steep , i think , but considering i could wear them practically every day and not get tired of them , i guess they are worth it . definitely considering purchasing another pair in brown !
1	got this for my father . he loves it . great coverage . easy to use
0	ordered mens 6.5 for my son , shoes are sized a womans 6.5 ( say mens 6.5 on box and shoe ) . i 'm going to have to pay $ 6.50 to return them for a larger size . do n't waste your money , buy nikes
1	the robe is very warm and heavy , perfect for cold mornings and the `` just out of the shower chills '' that you get . it doesnt quite have the `` luxurious '' feel of a spa robe , and the thread loops are matted in certain areas , but quality wise it is better than anything else i 've seen for similar prices . the length is much shorter than pictured . i bought this for my boyfriend , who is 6 ft , 190 lbs , average build , and it comes just above his knee ! all in all , it 's a decent robe for the price and he likes it .
1	great price . i have another pair of these shoes i bought elsewhere at twice this price . very comfortable . true to size .
0	poor quality , belts do not fit correctly , can not be returned because it is swimwear according to policy . do n't trust skinny dip swimwear
1	it will definitely get her attention in the best possible way
1	well constructed blazer . great color . you can wear with jeans or shirt and tie for church .
1	i found this product to be of very high quality and the transaction of the product was great . i recommend this for anyone looking for great bag , especially as a gift
0	i just mailed those back this past week to beall 's in florida . however , when the mailman took it from my mailbox ( i am 83 and no car ) he brought it back the next day because of insufficient postage on it . there was $ l.71 due . so , i put ( 5 ) 39 cent stamps on it , which would have been $ 1.95 . however , the next day the mailman brought it back and there were only 3 additional stamps instead of the 5 i had put on it . i called the post office , and fortunately , the postmistress believed i was being honest , and told me to send it back with the mailman . he was n't a happy camper , but i did send it back , and i trust that she went ahead and mailed it for me . i was concerned that it might have been too late for an exchange . other than the fact that the pants were too large in the legs and around the hips ... .they were okay , but by that time , i had changed my mind about them , too . also , i had bought these with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and never could find a place to apply it . jeanne alle
1	very warm and comfortable for the price . for any price , really . nice , looks good , feels comfy , keeps warm and cuts wind without reducing hearing in the least
1	the carhartt a110 cold weather merino wool socks were a gift for my son . he has been very happy with them , keeping him very warm in the cold of wyoming and colorado . i would definitely buy another pair for him and maybe for myself
1	this is the best sports bra i 've ever had ! i show dogs for a hobby and was always aware that , as i gaited the dog around the ring , i was bouncing ! now , no more bounce and extreme comfort . i 've had the bras for over 6 months now and they 've held up well . everyone that i 've recommended the bra to has had similar experiences
1	the slippers were perfect , exactly what i wanted . the price was good and they were delivered sooner then i expected . i 'm very pleased with my purchase and it was so easy to do . thank you very much
0	the sling support feature on these underwear is practically useless . my testicles always slip completely out of the sling before i 've had them on for even an hour . if these briefs enhance a man 's `` profile '' at all , it 's because they 're so darn tight ; it has nothing to do with the sling support . and talk about `` low-rise '' -- the top of my crack is exposed even when they 're pulled all the way up . i 'm in pretty good shape , but if these things shrink in the dryer , i wo n't be able to fit into them anymore . my advice : anybody ordering c-in² briefs should go one size larger than what he 'd normally wear
0	had only 4 wks ... ... poss . washed 2x ( and hung dry ) and underwire is coming out of side and poking me
0	i had high expectations for these socks given my previous experiences with the brand . the socks were too narrow in the foot and too tight around the ankle . they are not comfortable to wear and overall , a big disappointment
0	i washed 'em and they shrunk up so small i ca n't wear 'em anymore , bummer
0	this is a nicly styled jersey that could use a fabric or fabric finish makeover . the plain polyester is rough to the skin requiring the use of an undershirt to prevent chafing . the collar is cut high enough to cut across the base of the neck leaving a nasty burn mark . a cotton , cotton blend , or silk would have made a better choice of fabric making this an unbeatable jersey for many uses
1	as an advanced exerciser , i am always looking for a new , innovative challenge . the firm body sculpting ball workout provides just that . this workout comes with a sculpting ball , which is available in three weights ( four , six or eight pounds ) . i used the eight pound variety , and by the time we got to the ab work , i was ready to put the ball away ! my arms really got a workout , as did my core . there are several moves that require you to hold the ball out in front of you , over your head , and move it diagonally across your body . i could really feel it in my core after the workout . once we completed several segments of standing work , including grapevine , squats , and lunges , we go to the floor for bridge work and abs . you have to hold the ball between your thighs during the bridge work , which i found challenging since by that time i was sweating and the ball kept slipping away from me . you also hold the ball between your thighs to do ab crunches , which is difficult with such a heavy ball . afterwards is a short cool down , which i thought could have been longer . tina leads , and she is very fit and quite personable . she cues well and gives a few form pointers along the way . as with all the new firm releases , the background is sterile and boring . there are four background exercisers , with allison showing beginner moves . allie is holding the eight pound ball showing more advanced moves . the music is nice and non-intrusive . beginners will enjoy this workout . it is n't complicated and with a four pound ball you could get a really intense workout . unless you 're advanced and have some good upper body strength , i would not recommend the eight pound ball . you could injure yourself if you go to heavy . in fact , i was wishing i had another , lighter ball for the floor work . i have all eight new workouts , and i 've done three so far . of those , i liked this one the best . i felt i got a good workout , but i wish it were longer . the entire workout from start to finish is about 32 minutes long . another 15 minutes would have been great , although i suspect my arms would have been totally fried if we 'd kept going much longer . overall , i give this workout high marks . it 's definitely a keeper
0	i purchased this item to keep my wife warm and cozy for the 12-hour flight to japan . however , it was way too thin to keep her warm . after using it for about an hour , we ended up packing it back to the case and use the blanket given to us by the airline . since i spent over 40 dollars on this blanket i could n't even throw this away . i had to haul it around for the entire trip . i do not think it is worth 40+ dollars . 10 dollars blanket would do the same ( or even better ) job than this
0	the skin is fine and all the extras were nice . the one thing i really needed was a good elastic band for the arm . this product does not have a good elastic band . it 's too thin and not durable enough
0	bad shoe for sure . it is not for running . but want a cheap shoe for some dirty yard work . this may d
0	i ordered this dress and when i received it , i thought that it was very pretty . when i put the dress on , it was completely see through . you could see my bandaid on my thigh . i would not suggest this dress for anyone based soley on the material . it 's a shame because they dress is very flattering and also comfortable . it would also be impossible to wear anything under this dress ( including pasties ) because it seemed to show everything
0	i would not buy this sweater . it is flimsy , and not very quality feeling . the price was too good to be true
0	i bought this item because it said `` optional belt clip . '' the belt clip is only `` optional '' if you `` opt '' to leave it on and not use it . you can not `` opt '' to take it off . i would not call this belt clip `` optional . '' i would call it `` will ruin your new phone case if you attempt to remove it , '' which is what happened to me mere moments after taking it out of the paper envelope it shipped in
0	these gloves are very soft and seem to be made well , but they have a big flaw : the fingers are too short . ordering up a size may not solve any fit problems
1	i love my new steve maddens ! they are brand new as described and i received them verrrry quickly
1	i found these at lane bryant and i absolutely love them ! i wear them under my work clothes every day . you 've got to try them
1	i purchased this bre several weeks ago and found it to be the most confortable top i 've worn to date . since then i have purchased 4 more
0	i want to help overseas products , but this advertises itself as cashmere . it itches my neck ! cashmere does not itch . color was not represented appropriately
1	this top runs small , so order next size up . vibrant colors , nice fabric , comfy , attractive fit .
0	this bag is much smaller then i was expecting . the zippers do not open/shut easily . i was very disapointed
0	this bra works okay but the material is really uncomortable . the lace cups is n't feel like flour sack material .
0	oh my . it enhanced my rolls instead of hide them . it did not help having the bones sticking out above my butt , which was very noticeable . not worth the money charged for it .
0	judging from the picture , i thought this thing looked like a turban ! it actually has no wrapped fabric , but is a firmly fitting cap . hidden in the back is an elastic band that will adjust for larger heads , which is attached to the edges of an ugly looking triangular gap . aside from this , the coloring is too bold . old glory will select random coloration for each customer , but my selection has over twice the color variety as the one in the picture ! i do n't see how i can wear it without attracting stares
0	have purchased from this seller in the past with zero problems . this time was different . they sent the wrong shorts . i paid the shipping to send them back . i asked , please send the right shorts . they credited my account an amount smaller than i paid . and that was that . certainly not satisfied .
1	to echo another reviewer : i am a heavy runner with high ( semi-flexible ) arches and a neutral stride , running 20-35 miles per week . even though my strides are consistent in terms of length , pronation , and heal-to-toe gait , i tend to have very heavy footfalls ( being a former sprinter with muscular legs ) and need a well-cushioned shoe . i am training for the boston marathon and have tried asics gel kayanos ( the shoe designed for the `` clydesdale type '' runner ) , a pair of adidas adistars ( the newest model is a very good shoe but did n't fit my wider foot properly ) , and some various pairs of new balance ( least favorites of the bunch ) but the mizuno wave 7 's are by far the most natural feeling , durable , light-weight , cushioned ( without being bulky ) shoe i have ever owned . i have now owned two of the wave creation 7 's and a pair of the older wave creation 6 's and put a lot of miles on these shoes : they consistently hold up mile after mile better than any of the other shoes out there . the gel kayanos are the only shoe remotely comparable but i found that they break down far to fast for distance running ( and they are slightly heavy ) . that and the mizuno 's were comfortable from the first step and did not require any breaking which is very rare . i am confident i could switch to a new pair a week before a marathon and hardly notice a difference . i would not only highly recommend this shoe to anyone with medium to heavy footfalls and a high arch but i endorse it as the only shoe i will buy as long as the line continues .
1	this is really too small for me to use everyday but is great for times when i want something dressy . it is a very pretty little bag .
1	great product , works well and was shipped promptly also there was an accurate product description ... .thank
1	i got this jacket when it was $ 50 . i was very impressed at the quality and i like how it 's waterproof so i can just walk in the rain with it . great jacket and i think i will be wearing it for a long time
0	i bought a pair of these thinking they were only different in upper strap material . the footbed/sole is not cork like true birks , but some sort of composite ( rigid ) . birk straps are softer and birk corkbeds are more cushiony . i wore them around the house to see if they were comfortable and the footbed became marked - just from an hour or so . too bad because after that i knew i did n't like them . i tried on a pair of birk granada ( the style this is based on ) and immediately felt the difference . while these are about 30 % -50 % cheaper , i would have rather spent more on the original birks . i think these wo n't hold up as long and do n't offer the same comfort . also , you can have real birks `` repaired '' so they never really wear out . **black version has large `` betula '' on side in white
0	this is definitely not something i would want to wear while working out . even with mild exercise the lining feels sticky , and the fabric does not appear to breathe . i 'd rather wear cotton jersey pants than this . for cooler weather , i 'd prefer something like a good pair of tights ( sugoi for example )
1	my husband really likes the intimo men 's classic silk pants . they are very comfortable , and the color is really nice . he wears them almost every day ! the only complaint that we had is that the pants are a little bit short in length
0	these pants are fine if you have a very short rise , but i ca n't imagine that they would fit most people . i will be returning my order
0	have n't worn it yet to test the quality however , the structure is all wrong . one leg is more narrow than than the other ( i could barely fit my leg into it ) and the waist is really high
0	i received the trousers in a timely manner . they were what i expected although they did not fit . i returned them a month ago and have not heard a word from the company .
1	this bra is great for those of us with smaller busts . it 's the only bra i 'll wear under my t-shirts now because it does n't show the outline through the shirt like every other padded bra i 've found . it very comfortable . the only downside is that mine did lose it 's form ( it 's not as tight fitting as it used to be ) a little bit faster than some other bras . but , it 's absolutely worth buying a replacement . i just hope they never stop making this bra
1	i bought these boots when they were on sale . definitely worths the money ! they look great with skinny jeans tucked in , and they are really comfortable . whoever saw my boots loved them
0	i did n't like the material of this skirt especially the black and white one i do n't like it it 's feels it 's for old ladies
1	i bought a pair of these in tortoise and really love them ! they fit great , they arrived in great condition and very quickly . the rhinestones are really blingy in the sun ! i am buying a pair in black for my best friend who is in love with them also . very cute for the price
0	this wallet is so big for passport and don`t fit my documents from brazil . maybe is good for another country`s document
0	i ordered these based on the picture -- -a high cut brief . these are not the ones they sent me and now i have to pay to return them ! rip off ! ! ! zero stars
1	we loved this pair of sneakers for my 22 mo . old so much that we bought it in the next size up so that we/he could keep using them . they are so easy to get on him , and we all know some are so difficult . these slide right on while pulling the tongue . they are also wide enough for his `` flinstone '' feet , lol . they break in well for flexibility too .
0	when the product came it was torn and had one of the three pieces missing . i called the seller and they said all of the purses were missing one piece . i would not order from this seller unless you are not worried about all the pieces
0	i bought these for a bridal shower gift . they say one size fits all but they where like an xxxsmall . they torn right when they where tried on . very poor quality ! ! ! ! do not buy these
0	the shoes would have been awesome but ... .. the sizes run extremely small . i even ordered a size larger than normal thinking maybe this would happen . the shoes are still too small .
0	i just received this dress today . not only was it cheaply made ( there are rhinestones missing , threads , and it does n't flow smoothly ) , the top of the dress will have you falling out all over the place if you are in any other position than standing completely straight . also , the support is badly made . i have a very small bust , but i do n't think this would compliment anyone who is n't built like barbie . definitely would n't recommend . it looks great in the picture , but it 's not being modelled on a real person .
0	i have goddess bras , and it seems that each style has it 's own sizing . the love at first sight bra fits wonderfully , while this bra is about 3 cup sizes larger than what it is supposed to be
1	these jeans are extremely soft and comfortable . like most children 's place merchandise the quality is nice and cut a little larger then other brands . my only negative thought is that the material should be a little thicker . my boys are tough on their clothes
1	sexy and well made . i am a size 12 , but i bought the queen size and it fit great
0	the plastic screen on this case was very hard to keep clean , and very easy to scratch , so the view quality was horrible . also , the case was way to tight and was difficult to get the 30gb video ipod in and out
