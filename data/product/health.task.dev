0	i lovelovelove dark chocolate , ( and other strong , pungent things like goat cheese and dark beer ) but these taste just plain wierd . it 's not terrible , but i can taste the hoodia , sorta like dried grass mixed in with the chocolate . i think they work at reducing hunger , but they give me gas so bad i ca n't be sure if i want to eat less because of the hoodia , or the gas . maybe i 'll try the *regular* chocoleans , but i wo n't be buying this again . fyi : i absolutely love the phytobase powdered chocolate hoodia shake mix . i have no problems with that . tastes great , works great . and no gas !
1	after looking into several reviews on blow dryers , i learned about the revlon tourmaline . all of the reviews were so positive . i 've been suprised at how light the dryer is and how easy the controls are . the placement could n't be better on the controls . the price was right as well ! blow dryers in this class are generally much more expensive . a very good value
1	i 've tried many types of nutrition bars and many are too sweet or they are not tasty . clif bars get it right
1	heats up fast , rolls up easily ( does n't slip like old-school hot rollers used to ) , and stays on with the right hot roller clips . depending on the look i 'm looking for , i use 4 or up to 8 rollers for my chin-length fine hair , keep them on for 10 minutes while i put on my makeup , and voila ! soft , strokeable voluminous hair
1	i have a braun 8995 shaver which is fairly good but upon reading the reviews i just had to try out the panasonic and i am v impressed . dry it shaves v slightly closer than the braun but with just a splash of water and a dab of king of shaves gel the result is amazing and quite quick too , a v close shave in about 2 minutes . i keep stroking my face to feel the smoothness . i dont use the cleaning station , i just rinse it under the tap so the only ongoing cost will be the foil and cutters but with the results i am getting i am well pleased
0	though not advertised to humidify a large room , i found it incapable of making any significant difference in even a small room . i tested it , in a roughly 1000 cubic foot room , by placing a relative humidity sensor in the middle of the room , and after 2 hours not even a 1 % increase in humidity ! fortunately , i was able to receive a full refund
0	this is the second one of these i 've owned ... my first one the screen went blank after about a month and a half ... not an uncommon problem with this , i can see reading the other reviews ... but i thought maybe it was just a problem with that particular pedometer , so i bought a second one ... big mistake ! as far as the radio , what a piece of crap . i live about 20 minuters ' drive from downtown houston ... maybe there are too many radio stations around here . it just wo n't lock on to anything , not even the strongest stations . tons of static and stations fading in and out . i bought a pedometer with a radio because i wanted a radio while i walked . if you 're selling a pedometer with a radio , the radio should work . i would give this 0 stars if i could
0	would have been better if i actually got this.. i ordered this and got 6 dr. bronner 's lavender soap with a hemp tree soap bar code on the back . i 'm too lazy to send back and i already opened one and the lavender is nice . but i would rather have the hemp tree ... afraid to order again
0	it does let you shake and mix up the protein well . but no matter how tightly you screw the cap on liquid gets all around the edge and in the threads . then as soon as you put it down it all runs down the sides and leaks everywhere . it 's a horribly cheap and leaky design . i would look elsewhere or just be prepared with a lot of paper towels every time you use it . ( and if you find a good one that does n't leak please post the info here and let me know ) . thanks
0	this product states 4 toothbrushes . that is incorrect , it only holds 3 . this product also states 4 aa batteries or ac adapter . that is also incorrect . you can not use 4 aa . i felt that was misleading and unfortunately unless to me . if those things do n't bother you , it might be what you are looking for , but since it does bother me , i never even tried it
0	i know that this product works for some , but for me it did not . that is why i decided to return it . wahl makes great products , but this product was not for me . my skin was too sensitive and the machine irritated it .
1	tis is the best joint supplement i have found on the market . thank you amazon for carrying it
1	nizoral anti-dandruff shampoo seems to be a very good product . i noticed a difference the first time i used it -- there was no residue on my scalp , and my flakiness was greatly reduced . it produced a very rich lather , also . the only thing i did n't like about it was the possibility that i 'd have an allergic reaction to the ingredients , but the instructions did n't tell which ingredients might make this happen . i , myself , am sensitive to many products , and did n't have any reaction to the ingredients of the shampoo . i would recommend this product to others
1	i originally ordered a tanita scale and it stopped working within two weeks . ( amazon , of course , took it back with no problems . ) i was so glad when the omron scale arrived . it costs less than the tanita but the quality is much higher . the numbers on it are very large and easy to read . also , it is much easier to place your feet properly than on the tanita . i ca n't wait to try all the features . by the way , i weighed myself over and over and my weight only varied .2 lbs . as promised . great deal for the money ! ! !
1	i bought this to try it out based on a friend 's recommendation . previously i 'd always packed a couple old ratty towels with the dog 's stuff before heading to the lake or the beach . now i only need one towel and it dries like you 'd never believe . i have a 65 pound dog that loves the water . i make him shake the water off himself ( a trick as important as sit or lay down when you have a dog this big ) then i towel him dry in less than a minute . i now own 3 of these towels and have purchased them for just about anyone i know with a dog that gets wet . we live in seattle so not only are we surrounded by lakes other bodies of water , but we have rainy winters . having one of these towels hanging behind the door with the coats was a god send this winter as well . i ca n't speak enough praise about this towel . though a $ 30 pricetag for a meer towel could seem daunting , believe me when i tell you this is worth it . you 'll end up buying two
1	i love these bars . i 've tried all the flavors and they 're all pretty darned great . i eat them more for a snack than a meal because they are n't as filling as i 'd like , but they 're great for a snack or sugar craving
0	i 'm a huge fan of the pria line , but these are not like the others - they are heavier and a little grainy . i do n't hate them , but will not buy them again . the flavor is pretty good though , just not what i was expecting . i highly recommend the pria 110 calorie line - the vanilla is my favorite but the peanut butter and others are close behind . thank
1	hi , i 'm not a `` review '' person , but when i read the existing reviews , i felt like doing this . i used this product for 2 months and i must tell you that it really works ! i 'm hispanic-black woman ( dominican ) with relaxed fine hair and my hair grows normally , but only neck-chin lenght , no further than that . with this product i achieved a maximum growth rate and now my hair is leaving behind the accustomed lenght . i bought again the product to see how longer it can grows ! ! ! i 've been completely sincere with you ... i 'm not a staffer of this product company , i 'm a real and very happy user ! ! ! hope this comment will be helpful for other women . i have only one last thing to say : try it ! ! ! ! it worked for me..
1	it works very well . i bought it for my wives calves . she has thick ones and after working out it become more thick . using this product , her calves become soft and getting thin . i 've used it too , i can relax with it because it helps the blood circulation .
1	i love that stuff ! and now you have n't had it - but i need more - please make it available again . thanks
0	the pedometer arrive held prisoner in a difficult-to-open plastic cell -- what are these `` packaging engineers '' thinking ? it took me ten minutes and two ruined fingernails to open it , and then i took the scissors to it , and the hard packaging almost broke them ! but i was thrilled . a handsome object , thought i , and i loved the clip in the back that you pinch to open . so much better than having to wrestle it down over a soft waistband . i yanked out the plastic battery protector and set to work to rev the thing up to speed . but , alas , it would not follow instructions as they were written . `` press and hold the set button . hour display blinking . '' ( could they not have said , `` the hour display will blink '' ? i pressed . `` press memory button to adjust the hour . '' i did . the memory button never did a thing . so i asked a friend of mine to try and he had no luck either . we both tried several combinations of maneuvers , but nothing worked . to this moment , the hour display is blinking , blinking , blinking . i 'd like to get my money back , but ya know what ? j r music computer world in ny demand such a rigamarole to send it back , including with all the original packaging ( i threw the op in the trash ) , that you almost have to be a genius in packaging to follow their instructions , which , of course , are not designed to benefit the consumer but to benefit only themselves . now i 'm afraid this pedometer will follow its packaging into the trash , while i will make sure i never order from j again .
0	i am a male . i did a search and this item showed up for men . however , it is way too long for a man unless he is yao ming . it looked like i was wearing a skirt and came down several inches below my knees . i am 5'10 '' tall . also the light wieght microfiber terry was a drawback . it clings to you and builds up a lot of static electricity . i will not ever buy another product made of this material
1	we purchased eight of these ( 6 - 3/4 in . and 2 - 1 in . ) for our beauty salon in 1994 , and we 've never used another brand since . with their quick heat-up time and multi-level heat options , these irons perform superbly for precision curls . i was so pleased their performance that i bought one to use at home to replace my fancy vidal sassoon gold barrel , which only had two heat settings - too hot and burnt scalp . the heating element is so efficient that level 1 or 2 is probably sufficient for most home users . rarely did i have to set the iron at level 4 or 5 , and never above 5 . it takes less than a minute for the iron to heat up . four of the six irons we originally purchased lasted through 3+ years of constant professional use . at the price we paid , our weekly cost averaged out to pennies . if you purchase this product you will -not- be disappointed
1	best hair dryer ever . i have long , thick , curly , frizzy hair and after just drying my hair for less then 10 minutes with the conair 213x , my hair is shiny and soft . the diffuser is also amazing ; i can wear my hair naturally without any frizz . by far the best dryer out there in this price range . granted , it 's heavy , but it cuts my drying time in half and i do n't have to style after drying which is another plus ! it has a warm heat setting which is awesome and what could make it prettier than the rhinestones ?
0	i was very disappointed in this dryer and am returning it . it is very heavy and i am not a weakling ! it is also very big . with my arm stretched out all the way i can barely get it to my head . because it is so heavy and big i have 'banged ' myself on the head with the 'fingers ' . just things to consider when deciding whether to buy this dryer .
1	what a sinfully awsome tasting way to get rid of chapped lips
1	i have tried many brands of soy shakes , and this one is delicious.. i sure recomend it to anyone that wants to start the healthy habit of drinking soy . cookies cream flavor tastes like a real shake ! ! i really enjoy this drinks
1	my kids love this it fades right into the next color they fall right to sleep watching it change its an awesome light i was very pleased and its not to bright like some light up the room its just perfect mom of a 3 and 5 yr old ! !
1	the toothbrush section an the local drug store has at least a hundred different tooth brushes on offer but in spite of all this variety almost all of these have large heads . if you mouth is more petite or you have a strong gag reflex , your teeth suffer . the oral b head is small and although you have to work a little more on each tooth , you can . i have not had a cavity in years . my pearly whites look greate and my gums are firm an buffed . if only these woked on abs .
0	i bought this heating pad about a month ago and it did not get near as hot as i would like ! it is so hard to find a good heating pad now , but i would not reccomend this one
0	this item is rubbish ... it leaks , quite dangerous since water and electricity do n't mix . i got it , plugged it in filled it 3/4 full and had to stop cause water was all over my floor . i have already packed it up and will return it asap
1	this is one of those products i 'd put on my `` must have '' list if i had an elderly parent who could n't handle a vaccumm and had some area rugs or runners near the front door or entrance to any room . for daily touch-ups , these things ca n't be beat . they are extremely light and get all the stuff that gets dragged into the house between deep vacuuming . of course , i really believe that a doormat at the front door will go a long way in keeping out a lot of the dust and debris . for the stuff that gets by that , use the carpet flick . i tend to shake out my runners and deep vaccum them regularly but i 've noticed that some people who are elderly do n't have the strength for that . because i help out taking care of two people over 90 , this has been a great help to them in maintaining their independence and ability to keep things clean when i 'm not around ... and i 'm all for helping people to help themselves stay functional !
0	these 'cartridges ' sell for about $ 2 a piece , plus shipping . i recently switched from the mach 3 turbo to a merkur double edge safety razor and i can safely say i will never go back . the mach 3 provides a decent enough shave ( much better than an electric , in my experience ) but the single blade is actually much smoother . i pay about 50 cents a blade now with the safety razor - each blade lasts a little over a week - versus the mach 3 at $ 1.50- $ 2.00 lasting 6 or 7 days
0	i found this item to be equal to the conair curling iron you can buy in a drug store for less money
1	it doesnt quit dark circles , but helps against wrinkles while it is on your face
1	i bought one of these 'gizmos ' as a gift 3 years ago and i was so happy to find it on here ! ! it is like going to a salon and getting the best shampoo ever !
0	i was attempting to order aveda brilliant anti-humectant pomade , but received aveda brilliant humectant pomade . the packaging is so similiar . did not realize until i opened product that i had the wrong item . either you sent the wrong item or i inadverantly ordered the wrong one because of packaging . i was being very careful to follow every word ... so i wonder . ... does aveda srill make the anti-humectant pomade . i am stuck with the wrong item now that i opened the jar . at any rate , i am not a happy customer with a product that will not meet my needs plus i am minus the $ 22.53 amount spent
1	over the past two years i have been using several different green food products to try to find one that has a reasonable taste and seems to satisfy my physical needs . at age 70 those needs are many . after approximately two rounds of trying , it is miracle greens that has been most consistant in good taste and at the same time satisfying many of the needs i have for feeling better in general
1	i appreciate the gentle , yet powerful cleaning of all free clear allergen detergent . i have an infant find this cleans her clothes ours well without leaving any harsh irritants , so it 's easier to do the family 's laundry all together
1	the ultrasonic aromatheropy fountain is really unique . the sound generated , yet unheard , causes water to spring up from the surface 3-4 inches to provide a fountain-like water sound . at the same time , the frequency of the sound waves create a plesant cool misty fog that slowly boils over the sides and out along the surface it is sitting on . all the while , led lights under the water slowly change seemingly to all colors . the construction was just a little light duty other than that , very nice
1	i have a few minor quibbles with this razor , but it gives you a nice close , comfortable shave . and is n't that what we want in the end ? i do n't know anyone who buys one of these things for its `` ergonomic design features . '' it holds the charge for a good long time , and shaves your face nice . rinse it clean with running water and you 're done . that 's what i 'm looking for . the only things keeping me from a 5 star review is i 'm not yet comfortable with how the razor sounds when running . it seems like it 's always needing a charge ... but that 's how it sounds at full charge . it will take some getting used to i guess..others might find the quiet running mode a plus . also , the monthly cleaning of the cutters/combs is a bit complicated .
1	my daughter morgane , who is now 8 years old , has been suffering from delibitating migraines since infancy ( yes , there is such a thing , unfortunately ) . the symptoms are very impressive , she usually drops to the floor and starts vomiting within a few minutes . she can not move or open her eyes . it makes her very anxious and we noticed that she hyperventilates when she thinks she is going to `` get dizzy '' . we tried to make her breathe slowly and calm down , to no avail . morgane 's doctor told us that breathing slowly and practicing biofeedback were the best non-drug practices against migraines , and we try to avoid giving morgane medication as she is so young . so i thought of using resperate as my dad has high-blood pressure and i knew it worked on the breathing pattern . morgane immediately understood how to use the device , it was so easy and even fun for her . it relaxes her and gives her the strength to know she can do something about her migraines . her breathing pattern has reduced considerably and so far , she has not had another migraine attack for about 6 months . she used to have them every two months . i have purchased another device for my best friend , a long time migraine sufferer . the way i see it , it is such a painful condition that anything that helps without harm is a blessing
1	it is really good enough for my need . i have no problems so far
1	i just got my first case of this fabric softener last week and yesterday , i was walking downstairs when the smell of lavender hit me - i was surprised because i had n't sprayed any lavender freshener in the air , when i realized that my boyfriend was doing a load of laundry . like seventh generation 's lavender laundry detergent , i love this product - if you use them in tandem , not only do your clothes smell like *real* lavender ( not the chemically-based smells of mainstream products ) , but they come out clean and soft . i especially like the lavender smell for my sheets and blankets and it 's gentle enough to use on my baby 's clothes , too ! i love that it 's made with natural products and real lavender essential oil . it 's also safe for my septic system , so i 'm sold on this product . if you 're sensitive to the chemical-based scents of the mainstream fabric softeners or ca n't find one that smells good to you , try this one !
0	beware ! this thing , even if you try to be careful to be light on the pressure , as well as not keep it in one spot , it took the top layer of skin off ! my poor legs were in pain from my jeans rubbing up against them at work . ow ! i had to wrap them up in long cloth bandages till the skin healed . and what 's worse , it did n't take out all the hair ... . i could still see some hair here and there it missed , and i thought i got it all . i returned it immediately and got a refund on my money . never again ... . i 'll stick to my good ol ' electric razor instead ... .
1	i am 100 % satisfied with this product and it has already earned me what i paid for . i am able to trim my front portion of hair with this on my own , where as for a complete trim , i do need my wife 's assistance . if you trim on a regular basis , ie. , when the hair 's not over grown , you will definitely find the job more easier.i recommend it to everyone who wants to save on their haircuts . the price is a good deal too if you buy from amazon , else one may perhaps ahve to wait for the thanks giving sale
0	this thing comes with lots of attachments , of which i regularly used only 2 . the vibrating cuticle pusher is silly . as far as all those round discs , it 's hard to explain the physics of this , but suffice it to say that since it 's a rotating circle , you can only use half of it at a time or you 'll experience a bump-bump-bump . the thing rotates at such a speed ( even the lowest of the two speeds ) that even leaving on your toe or finger for a moment or two can create a burning sensation . what i did use was the smallest pointed attachment , which i used to lightly go around my nail close to the cuticle . this was good for when you 're wearing clear nail polish and your nails are starting to grow out . you can lightly buff down that ridge of polish . same goes for the edge where acrylic meets the natural nail . the other attachment i used , though less frequently , is the bigger cone-shaped one ( kind of looks like the shape of a foam ear plug ) . that i used to lightly go over my largest toenails to thin them down since i have trouble with ingrown toenails . again , it 's a challenge not to create burn when doing so . the nail dryer thing is silly and useless . if you manage to cram your hand into that little scoop without smudging the polish , it does n't do much anyway to dry your nails any faster than just letting them set . buy a little fan like they use in the shops if you want faster drying time . this thing is n't gon na do it . other folks mentioned this thing ruined their nails . it 's likely because they tried to use all of the attachments ( which you 'd think you should be able to do , right ? ) . much regular buffing on your nail thins it down and weakens it too much . the bump-bump-bump of the round attachments likely does n't help , either . a couple times i used this for acrylic nails . i have a tendency to wear acrylic nails a few weeks and then hate them and want them removed -- -and i 'm no longer willing to subject myself to the soak-and-pry method done in the nail salons . so the alternative was soak at home , or just trim down myself and then thin them to a more natural curved shape until the rest of the acrylic grew out . however , i mention i did this only a couple times . that 's because apparently acrylics are a bit too much of a challenge for this little `` deluxe manicure system . '' after sounding like it was ailing while it filed down the length of 2 acrylic nails , it gave a little bzz and then died . i waited a while to see if maybe it overheated . i tried other outlets . nope , dead . so i 'd pronounce this unfit for natural or acrylic nails . if you want something of quality for acrylic nails , invest in the dremel tools that the salons use ( just be sure to get one with a low rpm or foot pedal attachment ) . if you want something of quality for natural nails , go to the drug store and get some sandpaper nail files , a rectangular buffer , and a cuticle pusher . sometimes the best solution is the simplest .
1	my baby is 12 moth now and she uses the pampers cruisers ( size 3 ) from 4-month-old . it is soft and my baby never have `` rush '' with it . my whole family love this diapers .
1	i love this toothbrush , its easy and it really imporoves your gum health
0	i bought this product thrilled with the thought that i could use an epilator in the shower . even though that 's possible , the very last thing this product does is remove hair -- at least with the epilator head . the shaving head works fairly well , but a simple shaver would cost a lot less and shave as well or better . i ca n't believe panasonic thinks they 'll actually keep customers selling something this ineffective
1	i got this bed topper a couple weeks ago to place on my older matress . it was pretty pungent , but it felt so good the first time i layed in it . after a couple days it appeared to lose it 's memory and start to dent and crease , but eventually it got back to full expansion . the customer service with this item was fantastic ! we 'll see how long the matress keeps up its memory
0	i have been trying to suppress my appetite for awhile . i took trimspa 32 and i think that it did better than this product . i have been taking it for a week , and along with that , i have been substituting a nutrition shake for breakfast and a salad for lunch , plus working out . dinners are healthy about 5 days out of the week . i 've noticed no change . i am taking these to be able to eat significantly less and still work out . i 'm very hungry before lunch and when i get home i have to take a nap and ca n't work out until later in the evening . i really have noticed no change at all in my appetite or my energy level , which is really unfortunate
0	it ran good and i liked the different attachments , but i gave it away because i was uncomfortable with not having a lid like my previous one did
1	first of all i am in my early 20 's so i have n't much experience in night creams . i just more recently took an interest in moisturizers and eye creams after i decided to quit tanning and rather preserve my youthfulness . i use `` moisture therapy cream '' by olay in the morning before i put on my makeup , and then i use this at night . my skin always feels so soft , more soft than i think it ever did . i ca n't give any testaments on its firming or anti-wrinkle ability , but i can say it does make my skin glow and my complexion look healthier . the scent is great and it is a great smell to fall asleep to . i would recommend this product to anyone of any age . it has a good price compared to everything else on the market and i believe it is best to start moisturizing when you are young rather than waiting until the signs of aging have already begun . prevention is key
0	do not buy this iron . it 's fabulous while it works , for which it does merit the one star . but it broke in less than a week . it overheated , or something , and then would n't turn on again . but here 's the kicker : if you buy it from amazon , the company wo n't honor the warranty . i do n't have particularly heavy-duty hair . this is just totally unacceptable .
1	i have six children and had been feeling extremely fatigued ( like i could hardly move ) . i had been taking a general multi-vitamin from a local warehouse store . i started taking the nature 's plus source of life , and i felt so much better . my energy level has increased dramatically , and i just feel good . great quality product
1	my husband tried this after i bought it and he loves it . it is a great remedy for a hangover or even just a bad morning . it is very hard to find in most drugstores . now i just buy it on the internet . i 've even recommended it to friends who now swear buy it
0	a fine example of how fickle or intimate ( i prefer the word intimate ) scent is to each of us . this is one fragrance that i have not gotten to like . received as a gift more than a year ago , the bottle still has three-quarters . it does have a `rich ' scent but i find it to be too confusing and indescribable a scent , not educing a one word description like `sporty ' , `sexy ' , `alluring ' . i do n't wear it very often but i do n't recall a single occasion of `what fragrance are you wearing ? ' with this one . it 's just not my cup of tea so definitely , if you 're not familiar with this scent beforehand ; do not buy before trying it out at a department store for a day . why buy ? as a gift for the guy competing for the female that is currently in your crosshairs . as a gift for your boss - you will know he 's coming from a mile away . you need a gift for a guy who could n't pour water out of a boot even if there were instructions on the hee
0	i do n't recommend this ashtray to anyone . i was never able to use it since there were no instructions with it and i could not figure out how to put batteries in . other people tried besides me . there was no way to contact the company as their website does n't seem to exist anymore . at least i could n't contact them after numerous attempts
1	i do n't know why most of the reviews are so negative . mine works perfectly , it does not flip-flop , does not drop down and you can remove those thingies inside to make the water pressure higher for a more soothing shower experience . reason i gave it 4 stars is because i have what is called a `` diverter valve '' attached to my shower head . the waterpik is meant to be installed directly onto the shower head itself . i could not do that , because i have a portable `` wand '' that is moveable via hose connected to the valve and noticed that the threading is too short for the waterpik to latch on to . went to home depot and got an extension and a coupling , kind of ingenious and used lots of pipe tape to `` interface '' the waterpik via the extension , via the coupling onto the diverter valve ... .. wow ! no leaks ! works perfectly . for those of you out there that has a diverter valve for more then one showerhead option , go to home depot , lowe 's or a hardware store and what i wrote above will work as it did for me . enjoy
0	woolite bags waste of money . plan on sewing in your own zipper , cause the one that comes on it will fail probably within the first 4 uses.. maybe the 1st . keit
0	i 'm not sure if i just received a defective pen or what happened . my general experience with cross pens has been very positive . this one , however , is awful . it does n't write smootly and leaves ink everywhere
1	very happy with this purchase . received it in a reasonable time and at a great price including the rebate for signing up for an [ ... ] credit card . it is easy to use and seems more accurate than the wrist type monitors . i like the history feature in order to determine the average blood pressure over a long period of time since pressures change daily ! good machine especially since it has an ac adapter so that there is no need to change batteries frequently ! also , the intellisense feature makes sure the cuff is always properly inflated before readings
1	just love the homedic foot bath . easy to use and very ssothing on the feet . the pedicure attachments are a plus . the price was just great !
0	i have to clarify this is not the same as youthful essence . it does not work the same and the product is not the same . i must clarity that ... i dont want to confuse anyone here . youthful essence for instance is not pasty or harsh , or gritty . it is very smooth , and makes yours skin incredible and soft
0	i really wanted to love this fragrance ... after all , it is quite expensive and i 'd read rave reviews on many websites ... but after one spritz i sold it to a friend of mine ! my favorite perfumes are beyond paradise , ralph lauren romance , ralph lauren style , and dkny be delicious . light blue , to me , smells overwhelmingly of musk . i wore it all day and i ended up feeling nauseous , with a bad headache . this must be one of those perfumes that works well on most everyone else except for me
0	i could not get the right code numbers to work with my new tv/dvd set ... ..too bad , i liked the large numbers and light .
0	i have cracked heals and a bit of a callous problem . they are n't dragon feet , but they do have to be softened pretty often . i have used the little blade scraper tool for a few years and that works well but when i saw the artemis heel smoother advertised , i decided i had to try it . it 's a waste of money . the appliance is no more than a low-tech dreml . in fact , i have a dreml type tool that was marketed as a dog nail trimmer that works better . the artemis appliance does not scrape any dried skin away..it merely sands your foot a bit..that is when you can get the darn thing to stay on the spot you put it on . it comes with a small container of foot conditioning balm that is probably just straight cocoa butter except it has a really offensive aroma . i would just as soon use a piece of sand paper than this thing . save your money .
1	i am very fair and find it difficult to enjoy the sun because i constantly burn . i have tried everything and have never been completely satisfied . i went on my honeymoon to the maldives in november and was able to stay out in the sun , go swimming and i did not have to constantly reapply . i did n't get burned once ! bull frog superblock is the best sunblock around
0	i have a honeywell humidifier that is on my personal top 10 `` must have '' items . i figure with these cartridges the performance could only improve . i was wrong . there is no improvement in the cleanliness of the tank or the filter area . the water actually smells funny with the cartridge in . plus , i have noticed that the little beads inside fall out , and are reported to be harmful to pets and animals . they 're so little it 's hard to see them . not a huge deal to me , but i 'm sure it could pose a problem to someone . all in all , i would rather purchase purified water , or get a water filter for my sink for the water to use in the humidifier than use these , since there is no real difference .
1	man these things are the best . they can handle whatever issues i throw at them . i 've done considerable load testing as i 'm a truck driver who makes infrequent stops . thanks for making my life easier . i 'm totally back into life with depends
0	i 've been using this shaver for almost a year , and am disappointed with it . for years , i 've used the older style remingtons shaped like a rectangular prism . i suppose this new shape is intended to fit the hand better , but i never got used to it . i find myself supporting the shaver with my other hand because i feel like i 'll drop it otherwise . the big problem is with the screen . try very hard to avoid letting your skin come in contact with the edge of the screen . otherwise , the blades will bite you and sometimes draw blood . to clean , it is easy enough to remove the screen assembly , but getting it back on is tricky . if not very careful , it goes on unevenly and gets stuck . with practice , it usually works the first time . the funniest thing about this shaver is the plug that plugs into the wall . it looks like a cutting-edge state-of-the-art plug from the 1920s
1	this handy little device has be a lifesaver in helping to remind me to take my pills . it is easy to set up . just put in the # of hours between your doses , 12 or 24 hours for twice a day or once a day medications . i use two of these . the timer counts down the hours and then chirps . when you silence the alarm , it automatically starts the countdown again . the storage compartment is handy for keeping my pills when i travel . most of the time , i just use it to remind me to take my pills . i wish i knew about this a long time ago
1	i first used this product when i got a straight razor shave in a men 's salon awhile back . it really made for a smooth shave , which you definitely need when getting a straight razor shave . by the way , i do n't recommend getting a straight razor shave on your wedding day as i foolishly did . your face will be very sore . it took me 10 years before i got another straight razor shave , and i hated it as much as the first time . i 'll never get another . however , this oil product made the shave tolerable , and it makes daily shaving fantastic . this combined with the aftershave moisturizer makes for an incredible shave . it 's amazing how soft your skin feels afterward . buy the oil and the moisturizing aftershave , and you wo n't be disappointed
1	i pumped exclusively with my first child and had no need for disposable pads b/c washable ones were sufficient . with my second child , i did both and i found these to be the best b/c washable ones are not enough . they are large so wo n't shift when you roll in bed . they are very absorbent though i have woken up a couple times trenched . they are very thin and discreet . other pads are not as big so not enough overage . i never bother with the adhesives b/c they do n't work . they are a must for nursing moms and pumping moms in the first few month when you have lots of milk . i just wished they were softer and less paper like
1	i 'm a black male and everytime i would shave normally i would get irritated skin and ingrown hairs . at first i 'd feel a little itch throughout the day and by the end of the day i 'd see these tiny little bumps with white heads ( about 10-20 of them ) . that was before . now after i apply the product i do n't have the itch nor do the tiny bumps come up anymore . it just feels like i never had any hair on my face in the first place . the only bad thing about this product is that it burns slightly but i do n't really care i mean it 's not like the product claims to be painless .
0	i followed the instructions and did n't overuse it . the motor went after 2 months . i miss it so much that i am considering getting another one , even though i never got my money back for the first one
1	these bars are supposed to be for women because they are lower cal and have more calcium . i think there are other factors as well . men are usually affraid of products like vitamins for women stangely enough , but they say that they need calcium and protein too . i really like the key lime flavor it is great . i like lemon also and the chi tea . i like those flavors because they are light tasting and i do not always have to have chocolate the way some people do . the lime reminds me of the florida keys . these are really better than the original cliff bars and when they came out i did not eat another man ciff bar . i used to eat one of these for breakfast everyday with a soy milk when i had a busy life . thankfully my life has slowed down now . it is good grab and go food
1	my grandfather found a vial of old spice in his navy kit when he joined in 1943 . he continued using it after the war and my father picked it up when he himself came of age . i began shaving about ten years ago and choice was obvious : old spice is conservative and masculine , distinct and time-honored . it 's not a trend ; it 's a statement of manhood . if proctor gamble obliges , my own grandkids will be using it
0	do n't buy this product . i went through two units with the same problem . the trimmer is made of cheap plastic with plastic tabs to snap onto to the blade . within less than one week the tabs broke and the trimmer would no longer stay attached . further the base/stand is just a lightweight piece of junk that does not properly hold the handle and accessories - very poorly designed , wahl should be embararssed . it did a nice job of trimming my beard but the attachments are so awkward to install and remove , the base practically useless and the trimmer tabs break so easily that i would have given it no stars if possible . the fact that i returned one unit only to get a second that broke within a week makes me wonder what good the two year warranty is worth
0	first of all i was very disappointed when i received my waterpik cf-203c cascadia showerhead . it is all plastic ! i do not recall seeing that anywhere in the product specs . i thought when i oredered a chrome finish that it was some form of metal . sedondly , even with the head made of plastic , the plasic flexible hose is not strong enough to support it . we could not use it because the hose would just hang there and spray the wall . we installed it repeatedly , following each step of the instructions every time , thinking we were missing something . i eventually returned the showerhead to amazon
1	i have had this heating pad for several months and have never had a problem with it . it gets very hot/warm very fast and is very comforting . i use it on my neck and shoulders to help relax the muscles that cause some headaches . i would recommend this product to anyone . i 'm purchasing another one for my stepfather as a gift
0	this stuff does not work at all ! i tried this because it was the only one of the lens repair solutions that did n't have negative feedback , save yourself money and do not buy this product . it looks just like nail polish and leaves the same kind of film on your lense
1	unbeatable for the price ! worked fine right out of the box . easy to use and easy to understand instructions . i 'm glad i bought it
0	i bought this item for the warmth . the heat level is so low that i never can tell when the heat is on . as for the massage , it 's about what i expected - no good at all . overall , i would say this item is worthless .
1	philips sent me a reprogram plug-in that took me only 10 minutes to change the settings to meet the new standards . most of the low price aed 's use camaera batteries . my defibrillator has a long life lithium battary . i wo n't risk someone 's life on store-bought battaries . walt blankenshi
1	as a dentist of over 20+ years experience , i have seen over and over again the results of not flossing one 's teeth . the unfortunate result of such neglect is cavities ( especially in kids ) , and inevitable gum disease in adults , which in both cass over time leads to tooth loss . gum disease almost always starts in-between the teeth and the only way to clean the germs that cause gum disease and cavities from between the teeth is with floss . mechanical scrubbing with floss is the key , and all the daily brushings and rinsings will not remove the in-between stubborn plaque below the gumline . the bottom line is that we need to floss our teeth if we want to keep them for a lifetime . i have heard all the excuses for not flossing : the floss is too hard to handle , my fingers turn blue , my fingers are too fat , i 'm too clumsy , the floss hurts my gums , etc , etc . this disposable flosser is great for kids , who may not have the dexterity to load a non-disposable flosser , such as the `` flossaide dental floss holder '' , which i recommend for adults ( see my review ) . i have recommended this floss aid to my young patients over the years and i strongly recommend it to you as well . one still has to develop the habit of flossing daily , and this device aides in the mechanics of flossing , making it a breeze . get it and save your teeth ! jim `` konedog '' koeni
1	pik stik reacher/grabber did exactly what it said . i used the 32 in size to pick up items from the floor and in the yard . i 'm 5'4 '' and did not have to bend over to pick up things . it picks up coins , small pieces of paper , as well as jars , and leaves/gumballs from outdoors . i am completely satisfied
1	he 'd always had problems with frequent canker sores . after he tried this ( on a recommendation from his dentist ) , his canker sores went from 2-3/week , to 2-3/year !
1	i love the smell of an essential oil in the air . i 've tried tealight burners , a smear on a low-burning lamp , and a miniature crockpot designed for aromatherapy . the pearlessence spa mist is absolutely the best ever for diffusing an odor and continuing to diffuse it for an extended period of time . because i live in a humid climate , i was concerned that misting would only add to mold problems and perhaps mar wooden furniture . the cool mist instantly absorbs even into our air . the light show of the base can be turned off , but i like it most of the time . product was offered for $ 10 less than at a well-known local natural market chain , and shipping was free with my order over $ 25 with other products .
1	the satinelle ice epilator does exactly what it is supposed to do : remove hair quickly and efficiently by the root . what an advantage ! hair does not reappear as quickly as it does shaving , and when it does , it is not the sharp stubble that happens with shaving . i do n't think it hurts much , though some spots may be a bit more sensitive than others . the trick then is to simply lift it up off of the skin and stop momentarily . i am very happy with this product
0	the sleep guard did not keep my mouth open enough at night . my jaws still clenched tight
0	although i have used many electronic cuff devices in the past , this is one of the worst at providing accurate readings . firstly , the cuff is not adequate for very small or larger wrists and the readings are often lower than what you would get if the blood pressure were taken manually the traditional way . in a clinical setting , it is important that you get adequate readings so that the patient can receive the proper treatment based on their readings . it is imperative since you may or may not give medication depending on what you recive via the blood pressure measurement . i have taken a blood pressure manually after getting what i considered a questionable reading only to discover that the wrist blood pressure was far too low and more aggressive measures had to be taken because of the data that was retrieved the old fashioned way . imagine had i taken the initial reading as truth and the patient may have had a stroke as a result . as a rule , i never recommend using these devices for at home use because of the risk of false readings . many people who suffer from hypertension feel that this is a good way of monitoring their blood pressure when in actuality it is giving them a false sense of security . if you are considering buying this product for at home use or for use in a clinical setting , please ask your doctor or nurse for their opinions .
0	plain and simple i 'm 32 years old and been dianosed with hbp since 15 years old . i 'm on three medication for hbp . i order this then i wait for it to come . i jjust happen to go to the doctor today , he takes my pressure and tells me its 113/100 . when i arrive home one hour later , the device is waiting for me . i plug it up and it tells me my pressure is 101/75 . sending the unit back
0	i 've used the same straightener for the past four years and have always been able to get my naturally curly hair perfectly straight . this past christmas though i got the conair tourmaline ceramic straightener as a gift and decided to try it out . not only did it not work for anything , it pulled my hair and broke it at every pass . also , it took more than twice as long as my normal straightener . needless to say , i 'll be taking this back for an exchange . i suggest the normal flat panel straightener for anyone with naturally curly hair
1	it takes some getting used to , but once you do you will love it . it leaves my teeth cleaner than any toothbrush , electric or other , that i have ever used . you feel at first like it is totally strange ( it is ! ) . does n't take more than a few times using it to realize that it 's a great concept and so much faster than anything else . i have no buyers remorse . i just wish that changing the brushes on it were simpler so one brush could be shared with another person . you really are best to have one per person with this one since changing the brush a lot is a hassle
0	i bought this pricey little bottle of lens dr. hoping that it could extend the life of my expensive glasses but what a mistake ! it did nothing but make it worse ! after i saw what it did to the lenses , i had to scrape and scrub to get it off ! i hope that no one else will waste their money on this worthless product . a big rip of
0	these wipes are very rough . we bought these when our daughter was first born and i ended up not using them on her because she would scream everytime i used them . if your baby has sensitive skin i would recommend the huggies newborn or the huggies supreme wipes . wipe your face with one and you will see how scratchy they are . imagine how your baby 's bottom feels afterward
0	i own a more expensive braun but bought this model as a gift for someone who i was n't sure if he would use an electic toothbrush . after 7 months , the toothbrush wo n't turn off-something is shorted out . unfortunately i no longer have the receipt . my more expensive model which i use multiple times a day has been problem free for over five years
1	i got what i expected . it 's functional and not too poorly made . the only problem i had was that the scratcher part was a little too sharp . i filed the sharp edges off and now it 's great . the rolling wheels still have no function for me , but they do n't get in the way
1	they are a nice compact size for travel . they work as advertised , just expect to let them heat up longer than the stated `` quick curl '' time
1	my last braun razor was model 6550 , which i purchased 7 years ago . the braun 8975 is a pleasure using , quick and close shave . the technology has come a long way . i have always used braun and this is by far the best yet .
0	the shampoo works fine , but it has a very different smell that i was not expecting . it smells kind of woodsy/spicy
0	i suppose it serves a function for people with bad eyesight or something . but ... ... dear god that thing is ugly
0	these hair topia pills are nothing but garbage ! pure nonsense ! trust me , i know this because i used to buy them . i first bought these pills last year in june 2005 after hair formula 37 's unsuccessful promise of producing longer and stronger hair in the four months of usage . well , these pills were not as expensive as the previous brand mentioned , and had promised also to change dry and brittle hair to long and healthy , and it did absolute nothing . i said to myself , like hair formula 37 , that maybe i just need to give this more time , so i bought a 2-month supply and gave it 3 months in all and there was no difference at all . this product might just work for others , which it has , but it certainly did n't work for me . i must admit that i brought this on myself , as my mother warned me not to buy these ridiculously expensive pill since they do nothing for hair that grows naturally anyway , and that if you really want to get hair pills then just buy them a whole lot cheaper in regular stores like giant or even hair vitamins in the damn dollar store ! these hair growth pills are too damn expensive , so when you are paying all of that money then you expect it to work . the fact that it does not is infuriating because $ 39.99 + $ 7 in shipping , with a total of a little over $ 46 , is a lot of money to spend on something that does nothing . thus , i am here to warn others not to waste their precious money . and if you are going to , please do n't do it on this site-you can buy this product a little cheaper at hairboutique.com .
1	alka-seltzer got it right and in a big way . drink this and 20 minutes later your headache is gone and your stomach is settled so you can motor down to the local taco stand for some much needed nourishment . i prefer the regular flavor as opposed to the citrus .
0	i was surprised to find positive reviews for this heating pad , since i just returned mine after one use . perhaps the one i got was defective , but even on the highest setting this heating pad was barely warm to the touch and was n't hot enough to penetrate my sore back muscle . i also thought that the convenience of strapping the pad on would be excellent to target the lower back area , and found the shape of the pad and the flimsy elastic strap provided to be very uncomfortable to wear . the placement of the strap does n't allow the pad to conform to the body , but only to press against it where the strap runs through - just the center , not the rest of the pad . i realize there are probably now safety standards for heating pads that preclude them from getting too warm , but hopefully they are not so stringent as to not allow any electric heating device from getting warm enough to penetrate sore muscles properly . for the time being i 'll keep wearing thermacare ( tm ) back wraps ( which are expensive - could have bought two heating pads by now ) but do last 8 hours at a time and provide intense enough heat . also , this disposable product is surprisingly comfortable to wear and more directly applies heat to the area where i need it . if you need intense heat for a sore back , i 'd skip this heating pad
0	i have found that the ms-5700 to be very loud . the braun 8995 that i replaced it with is very quiet . the plastic chrome on the body gives it a very cheap feel , and look , it makes it hard to hold onto . i have found that the shaver dos n't give me a very close shave compared to the braun 8985 shaver . the solution tank for the cleaner seems to be not as user friendly as the braun 8985 that holds a cartridge that slips in and out to replace . as you have read i have replaced the ms-5700 already with the braun 8985 , and am very happy with the change . the braun also came with 3 cartridges for the cleaner unit , not just one bottle to pour into the cleaner .
0	ok ... received this item last night ... used once , and in the process realized i was pointing a laser beam on my skull . given the directions say 3 times a week , 15 minutes per , i would have to do this for a long time with no proven results ... save yourself the time ... do this ... go to google and type in `` forum and hairpro '' . you will find next to nothing regarding information for this product . i made an impulse purchase getting sucked in to the exploitation ... after further research even the top rated hairmaxx brush selling for $ 500 has mixed results on the online forums . not to mention that viatek had spelling errors in the pamphlet that came with the product ... if they do n't have the time to make sure all is spelled right in the manual , how much time did they spend creating the actual product . the box had a date of 2005 and there was dust all over it . these lasers may work , but with all the research i did ( after the purchase ) results seem minimal for all the work that needs to be done . i felt ridiculous using the thing too . i am just annoyed because again i got sucked into a new gimmick for something that companies can exploit in individuals .
0	the reading magnifiers i ordered 09/29/04 finally arrived 10/19/04 after a call to the seller . ( original order was shipped to amazon.com so it had to be reshipped to me . ) it only took 5 minutes or so to assemble one of the reading magnifiers , and it is possible to adjust it to just about any position with the clever arm . the weighted base does keep it from falling over . unfortunately , the thin plastic lense is such poor quality that it is very difficult to receive any benefit from the device . if the user turned the adjustment knob too far , it and the nut that holds it together would fall off . the nut is small and must be inserted into the outside of the adjustment knob to assemble the device . the knob actually turns the nut onto the screw . presumably the device is for someone with low vision . if the small nut falls to the floor , i 'm not sure someone with low vision would be able to find it . my advice is to save your money and buy a quality device with a nice glass lens ... . and if possible , try the device out before buying .
0	in my experience with this product , i had no significant hair growth . very disappointing for the amount of money you spend on it , and the amount of pills you have to take daily ( ugh ! ) . however , i gave it a two because while it did n't grow my hair , it did change the texture of it . my natural hair is very coarse , and while using the hf37 it became really soft , silky and manageable . nice , if that 's what you 're looking for a hair vitamin to do . but as far as hair growth ... absolutely not recommending hf37 for that
0	because if you do , this is the unit to do it with ! the combination of a demineraliztion cartridge that does not work and/or the silver stick has resulted in the total coating of my new macbook pro 's internal circuitry with metal deposits . no , i do not work in a metal shop . i use my computer solely in my apartment room . yes , it is from the humidifer . the dispersion pattern is heaviest around the fan intake areas .
1	this product is simply phenomenal . i 've seen better results using this than with department store brands
1	great product , the girls had a blast with it . real easy to use and real easy to put the gems back in the jeweler once you take them out of your hair . great fun for girls who enjoy dressing up and getting bedazzled ! although it kinds of pulls a piece of hair or two out when you try and slide them out of your hair . not all the time though . still a fabulous product . would highly recommend it . my niece wishes it came with more gems
1	i was skeptical about this product but tried it anyway . it does work and it does eliminate the dip in the middle our mattress had formed . this has given our mattress a little more life so it will last a little longer until it 's time to give in and buy a new one
0	i do n't know if it works or not - i just received it and all i get on it is a low battery reading
1	this is a great little dryer if you travel , or just for home use.well worth the price . cookiema
0	i bought this shaver about one year ago . for years i was using braun shavers and was happy with them but decided to try competition . in spite of few people on internet who mentioned short lifespan i gave panasonic a try . shaving is fine , it runs quiet and you get 5-7 shaves with one charge . after about one year it started making strange noise and you get only 3-4 shaves with one recharge . month later slowly went dead . exactly as some other people wrote on bulletin boards , what make me to believe to those people writing reviews . you would expect more shave for $ 100 . today i went to buy braun shaver .
1	i absolutely love this scale ! it is easy to program and enjoyable to use . best of all , it 's beautiful to behold
0	just received two of these . yes , how dumb of me to buy two not knowing much about it . the quality of the casing is really poor . the plastic is very flimsy feeling . the labels were all half-way peeled off upon opening the box . they show signs of just simply being really old . the instructions are written in many languages which is fine , but there are things they fail to tell you . i also ordered the juice aa 4 pack and 2 of the batteries arrived dead . the charger blinks red with those batteries , but the instructions do not even bother telling you what a blinking red light means . if you go to the juicebattery website , they do not mention this product anywhere . not even when you search for it . a good chance this is a fly-by discontinued product . the company themselves have not responded to by blinking light question for 3 days now . as with many things , made in china ! i got a few more days yet before i need to return them via amazon 's return policy which as we all know , rocks !
0	i got this curler set , and i completely regret it ! i used it once , and i wont touch it again ! it left my hair frizzy , and there was a bump from where the clamps were . it took me 3x as long to get fix my hair as it did to put it in the curlers and wait for it to cool down . i would n't even give it one star ... take my advice- do not buy this !
1	recently got my sleepmate and it is very effective . somehow it blocks out most sounds outside of my bedroom , and i do n't have any trouble sleeping . i use to wake up at least 2-3 times a night , and have the hardest time getting back to sleep . i hardly ever wake up at all now . great product , and i 'd definately recommend it to anyone in need of a good night 's sleep
0	it took my 3 1/2-year-old 10 seconds to defeat this . it took me about 30 minutes to install it . pretty ineffective , as far as i 'm concerned . your mileage may vary
0	why are you paying such good money for a no-calorie water ? ! how many calories does water have to begin with ? ! it would be interesting to see what the placebo was that they used in the double blind trial ( ? a cheeseburger ? ) . please do not buy this . fill a bottle up at home and squeeze a bit of lemon juice in if you have to ... . no calories ! give the money that you would have spend to charity . the makers of this water are thieves and con artists
0	i was offered one of these while cycling and thought it was very tasty . so good , in fact , that when i got home i went straight to the web site show on the back of the wrapper to learn where i could buy them . just above the web address is the nutrition and ingredients list . that was probably a mistake on the manufacturer 's part as it gives you something to read while the site comes up . oops ! this bar has a whooping 25 % of your daily allowance of saturated fat ! not only that , but the fat is palm oil . this might be acceptable for a soldier involved in prolonged strenuous activity but i doubt a cardiologist would recomend it to most of us . a commercially formulated product is more likely to fill the average person 's need for a lower fat ( and healthier fat ) energy bar , than one formulated for extreme physical activity , sold for profit and marketed as a patriotic tribute to the troops . bottom line : read the label , weigh the health risks and if you want to support the troops , there has to be a better way than eating hooah bars .
0	this product is called a `` bouffant style oversized '' shower cap . it is so small that it would not fit over my wife 's head . the product features list claims it is made of `` soft , pretty fabric . '' in fact it is made of thin , crunchy plastic . it is so poorly made that the stiching is crooked , overlaps and has threads hanging in several places . this shower cap went directly in the garbage
1	i really do love this item . i 've been using it without fail since the day it arrived . i have n't had any significant problems with it and highly recommend it for anyone . i hated wearing the chest strap on my other monitor . the only problem i have found is that i ca n't grip things and have the monitor continue working . so when i am lifting weights i have to leave that finger extended , when i 'm using the eliptical trainer i have to leave that finger extended . now that i 'm used it , it is n't a big deal . it is accurate . so far it has agreed with all other monitors that i 've checked it against . so with the one minor exception i highly recommend it
0	i like to use the wet wipes , they 're good products . i gave only 2 stars because the package was n't packed well . i received the package this week . all seals of three boxes were broken , lids fell off , and the wipes were everywhere in the package , they were dried up , but the amazon packing box was all soaked wet , and it almost fell apart . what a mess it was !
1	great piece of equipment , no guessing how accurate the scale might be with this great healthometer
1	yes , i did feel a difference . benadryl is not effective for me so i was sceptical . i am glad i found this . i use for when i need to sleep in an unfamiliar place
1	necessary replacement brush heads to maintain correct oral hygeine with rotary braun electric toothbrush . i foung amazon.com 's price for this item cheaper than costco or sam 's club ! ! !
1	my daughter and i have searched for a sunscreen that both of us would like , and never found one that was completely satisfactory . she has oily skin prone to breakouts , and mine is combination . every one we tried always left a greasy feel and look to the face , even the ones that were supposed to be oil-free . finally , i came across a review of this product on paula begoun 's website ( www.cosmeticscop.com ) . the review sounded good , so i went out and bought some right away . my daughter and i both love this product ! it 's the only sunscreen we have ever used that does n't leave a greasy feel or look to the skin . it dries to a matte finish , and works very , very well under foundation , too . without foundation , there is no need to use powder to kill the shine . and it feels so light on the skin , you barely know it 's there ! if you have oily or combination skin and have never found a sunscreen that does n't look and feel greasy , try this one ! it 's the best !
0	this thing is unbelievably lame . it does n't massage . it vibrates . y'all have sat in massage chairs before at sharper image or brookstone . they can be really good , with kneading balls that roll around giving a surprisingly deep back massage . this thing does n't even resemble those chairs . trust me . i am sitting in one now . it is my main office chair . i have not turned on the `` massage '' function , or even plugged it in , since about three days after i bought it . the `` massage '' feature is more like an annoy feature . it just shakes you around a bit , but does n't actually feal good in any way .
0	after hearing about this product and reading the reviews , decided to get one for our newborn baby . the problem however , is that this does not cover the entire room even on its `` high '' setting . over the course of an hour , i would say this thing covers only a sixth of the air in our room ( 12 x 12 ) . i put my hand in front of the sanitizer and could barely feel any airflow and this was on the high setting . i 've only had this product for a month so i will have to follow-up on durability . first month impression is this thing is too weak to adequately sanitize an entire room . if it were a bit stronger , would give a better rating . i feel like i will return this item and get a stronger air cleaner , or buy 3 of these ( not practical )
0	this thing messed up my back . it is extremely uncomfortable and i ca n't see anyone liking the feel of it . furthuremore it smells terrible . do not buy this product - you will regret it . ( shipping was n't bad
1	these are great for those days you just want to sit in the sun and read without sun glare . great product
1	overall an excellent trimmer - this is what i have been needing all of these years . finally a piece of equipment that does it all . i have been very pleased with this trimmer - it is solid , and cuts without problem . i love the adjustments , and the removeable head . thanks remington , and my wife for the christmas present
1	it does a great job , i just tought it wound n't let any hair go , but i gess that 's impossible
1	if you live in an old building where the toilet is always getting clogged by your abundant use of regular toilet paper , then this is the brand and variant you should switch to . if i were to objectively judge it by what it promises ( rapidly dissolves ... ) , i 'd have to give it five stars . it practically melts as soon as it touches water . do n't expect to be able to use it for mopping water off the sink ; you 'll just end up with a mess of dissolved tissue . i 'm giving it only four stars , because it 's not my favorite toilet paper ( that would be charmin ultra ) , but the necessary choice .
1	this baby has helped me track my heart through all the highs and lows and ultimately allowed me to assist my doctor in verifying that something is seriously wrong with my blood pressure . we 're yet to verify what the culprit is ... but this little guy helps me know when to slow down or kick it up a notch . i would highly recommend this guy if you 're looking for a wrist-inflatable blood pressure monitor . it 's been consistant , reliable , and informative for both myself and my doctor
0	sure it has many pretty lights and a slick design . one problem though : it is terrible at shaving ! i was using my old braun 6520 , and was quite happy with it . then i saw a good deal for this `` new , redesigned , superb , self-cleaning '' shaver and decided to upgrade . bad idea ! after shaving with it , it looks like i have a day-old stubble . no matter how much i twist and press it , the `` new super system of blades designed by no one other than gillette '' does a bad job . this morning i actually pulled my old 6520 out , shaved off as much as i could with this `` 360 complete '' garbage , and then used 6520 to see how much `` clean up '' it would do . the difference was both very visible and substantial ! i am really sorry i bought this and feel duped by their marketing ... do n't make the same mistake as me . buy something else and save your money
0	i purchased these but had to return them . while the molded strap is adjustable , it only opens up approx . 1 '' . the magnetic attachment worked well but if your head is 23.5 '' or larger around - at the eyebrows , forget it , these will not fit you
0	i bought this straightener two times..the first time i had it for about 8 months . my friend had bought the straightener and i fell in love , so i bought my own . the first 8 months were heaven . i straightened my hair all the time . then , at 8 months , one of the plates stopped working ! for a while i used it , but it took forever , and did n't straighten my hair well at all . i decided to buy another , thinking that it was just a defect on the first . i bought the other and it did n't work nearly as well as i had remembered ! in fact , it stopped heating up all together within 3 months ! ! another friend of mine bought this same straightener and it caused problems for her as well . we have both decided against buying this one again , obviously , and i would reccommend you do , too . i have heard that the newest conair straightener is wonderful , and comes with a two-year warranty , so i would n't have to pay again , if it did the same thing to me that this one did . do n't buy it ! unless , of course , you enjoy being ripped-off..
0	worthless . motor is loud and heating not noticable . in 10 minutes hot water became luke warm
1	i really like this curling iron ... - and you definitely ca n't beat the price ! it heats up very quickly , and gives me great curls . the key to working with large barrel curls are to use a mouse or cream to texturize your hair . then , after you curl , make sure to take a blowdryer on cold/low setting to lock the curls down . i always receive so many compliments on my hair ! !
1	i have been using this razor for about 6 years now , probably as long as they have been out . they may be pricey but well worth it . i used to use disposables and nicked/cut my legs almost every time . i switched to these and have maybe nicked my legs very little . it is so quick and easy to use , and my legs are much smoother than they ever were with disposables and shaving creams . they do only last for 3-5 shaves , but if you figure in the price of disposables and shaving cream , it 's probably not that much more expensive
0	do n't be fooled by the similar-sounding , inarticulate reviews -- this product is not what you think it is . it contains neither motor nor electrical stimulation . the `` energy fields '' described have nothing to do with actual energy/electricity -- they might as well use the word `` aura '' for all of the logical sense it makes . in the words of a company representative : the tingler is not battery operated there is no button . that would be our sqwiggler which has 2 aa batteries located in the handle . you 're welcome to return the tingler for a sqwiggler . the sqwiggler is $ 29.95 please call 800-978-8765 and we can get your credit card information and charge the amount difference of $ 9.95 plus $ 8.45 for the shipping fees . make your own judgement , but do n't expect to be as wowed or thrilled as the company claims you 'll be
1	great for people with sensitive skin or prone to acne . i began using neutrogena as a teenager 25 years ago . it helped clear up teen acne has kept my skin free of razor burn in more recent years
0	the foil is a bit misleading , because if you are shaving parts of your body with many curves ( under the zipper ) the timmer will catch you and it hurts , a lot . the foil can only be used on straight surfaces . the two trimmer blases rest at about a 200degree angle . if you have to many curves to mow with the foil without hitting the trimmer ... . well , be prepared to spend a night or two on the sofa
0	i recieved these dead , they do n't fit right in most devices and i have n't been able to get them to work since they 've been recharged , it 's not my charger ... .. waste of mone
1	i love this book light ! it has survived countless drops to the hardwood floor by me and my 2 year old . it works great with hardback and paperback books . this is by far the best book light i have ever used
0	oprah winfrey and kevin costner the leading medical researchers in america think this is a great break through . well gee , if they like it you must too . there is no scientific basis other than the nice school teachers `` guarantee '' that this works . after you pay 5-6 bucks for some fizzing tablets that taste kind of good you might think something is happening . well it probably is , in your psyche . if that and kevin costner testimonials do it for you then go ahead . ca n't seem to find the `` guarantee '' on their web site other than they will do their darndest to improve the product and you 'll be the first to benefit
1	i find the item in perfect shape and operates effectively thank you so much bimvik
0	stay away from this seller `` salter '' . i ordered this product 20 days ago and finally got an email saying that there 's an unexpected delay ! i cancelled right away , after waiting for almost a month
0	unfortunately , this is poorly designed . it is too high to rest you wrist on comfortably and the 'stimulating ' rolling rubber parts are too hard and abrasive
0	the seams on the pillow are sharp and uncomfortable . the extra pouches that supposedly provide additional support do n't measure up . the snaps that should hold the ends together do n't work . basically , it would be ok if it came with a soft cover
0	after many disastrous leakage experiences with their smaller-size diapers , i decided to give huggies another try because i have a very active toddler , and these certainly did appear to be stretchy and comfortable . unfortunately , this comfort comes at the expense of utility . my daughter was no sooner running around in the first diaper out of the pack , when i saw the entire contents of her diaper coming out the sides and up her back . just like the smaller sizes , this version does not hold anything in ! ! !
1	this is an exceptional value for an exceptional dryer . i have paid alot more for more well known , brand named dryers . i have long thick hair and this product dries my hair in half the time other dryers have done in the past . buy this hair dryer , you wo n't be sorry
1	i bought this toothbrush a month ago , and have been very satistfied with it . the battery lasts about a month and the brush leaves me with a clean feeling that you ca n't get from a manual toothbrush . the price is good , the battery life is good , and the battery door is very easy to open ! i would buy it again !
1	the knots in my back - my `` spots '' never really go away due to posture and my work in front of the computer . one day i asked a coworker what the odd green thing by his desk was . he explained the concept , i tried it for about two seconds and immediately knew this was something special . the leverage is perfect for zeroing in on your back knots and applying strong pressure to them - like having a strong friend digging their knuckle in and holding it there . i bought one the next day . you do n't need an expensive vibrating massage wand that has all sorts of silly features - just this simple stick that can pinpoint and dissolve all your stress spots .
0	it works , but it takes a long time to really trim it down . very low power , made of plastic . i do n't recommend this product
1	i have seen these in catalogs before did n't give them a second thought . then one day when i was cleaning under around all of my shampoo bottles , etc in the shower , it hit me that one of these might just consolidate all the shampoos/conditions body wash that i have collected in my shower . so , i ordered one a higher price i am so thrilled that i am ordering one for the kids ' bathroom where i had hubby put in an extra shelf just to hold all the shampoos etc . now it will all be in one place , not messy out of the reach of my toddler ! the other thing that i have noticed is that i do n't use nearly as much shampoo as i did before - i get a few squirts if that is n't enough , i get more - no more dumping a handfull of shampoo in my hand . i know i use far less shampoo than i did before i had this so i am no longer wasting it ! this is just the greatest concept this product is very easy to keep clean it works looks great in the shower . i would recommend this product to anyone ! if you do n't think you will fill up all four sections - get a smaller one but i found the 4 section one is just what i needed ; one for clarifying shampoo , one for conditioning shampoo , one for conditioner one for body wash. no more bars or shampoos cluttering my bathroom
1	definitely the best heating pad i 've ever experienced . i 'll never buy any other kind of heating pad again . this is by far the best and well worth the money . i love that it can set the temperature precisely and much higher than any other heating pads i 've ever seen ( that only have `` high medium and low '' settings , and usually the high and medium settings cause burns , or do n't get hot enough , or go from barely any heat to burning ! ) this heating pad 's lcd shows the actual temperature it 's at , which is great . and yes it feels very moist , but not like you 're getting dampness on your clothing . my only complaint is that it shuts off after 60 minutes . i could easily have this on all day :
1	this is the best sound machine out there ... ..i worked in a doctors office where they used these , and they were amazing . my husband can not sleep without some sort of `` white noise '' . we purchased this and our sleep could n't be better . best bet for the money . it 's also adjustable as far as volume , just twist the top . very quick shipping as well .
0	i liked this heating pad so much when i first used it that i immediately ordered a second one ( for what i expected would be a year or two in the future ) . what i liked was that the wiring was indeed much thinner than other pads , allowing it to conform to the shape of my body . however , the first pad lasted only two weeks before failing to heat . i returned it to homemedics and they ignored me . the second one lasted nearly a month before it to failed to heat . i will not bother wasting the postage to return this one , as obviously homemedics does not care about quality nor customer satisfaction . i recommend that you not waste your money on this defective product
1	i purchased this for my husband . he hates to shave everyday and now he can without the razor burn . it is even as close a shave as if he used a razor ! i saw it on the consumers number one pick for foil shavers and i am glad i went with their reccomendation
1	no problems . like the small format bottle , easy to store . works as well as anything else
0	terrible reception . tinny speaker . radio does not `` remember '' last used station when turned off . do n't waste your money
1	this razor is fantastic . the gel pieces are very soft and keep even my dry skin from being too bad ! ! the only problem i had with it was the gel parts do n't last quite as long as a bottle of shaving cream/gel would . but if you are looking for a quick , handy and yet still good shave , this is exactly what you are looking for
0	why are you paying such good money for a no-calorie water ? ! how many calories does water have to begin with ? ! it would be interesting to see what the placebo was that they used in the double blind trial ( ? a cheeseburger ? ) . please do not buy this . fill a bottle up at home and squeeze a bit of lemon juice in if you have to ... . no calories ! give the money that you would have spend to charity . the makers of this water are thieves and con artists
1	you wo n't have to use much lotion on your body after using this product . i love it ... .
1	i saw these reading glasses on csi : ny and just had to have them ! it 's really nice to have a quality pair of reading glasses ... and the wow factor does n't hurt either ! i 've read some of the reviews and can see where women with hair past their shoulders might have a problem with this type of glasses . my hair is shortish ( layered to the bottom of my neck ) and i would n't want it any longer if i was going to wear these glasses a lot ... which i do ! they are n't portable ... but they are n't supposed to be . i keep mine in my office where i need to take them on and off the most frequently . i 'll probably get another pair for home but i 'll used my old ones i can put in my case for carrying in my purse . all in all ... i 'm very glad i got them
1	this is very easy to use and quite convenient . i 'm not sure , however , how accurate this monitor is . it seems to record a higher reading than a manual one at times . the value of this home monitor is if the readings change dramatically . then it 's a warning to go to the doctor 's
1	yes it is pricey but worth it . i tried the gilette skin care and liked it . at that point , $ 5 bucks for 1.7 ounces felt crazy . so when i bought this i thought i must be mad . but for my skin it works fantastic . it also has the distinct advantage of how it dispenses . you get a controlled amount unlike a tube by pressing down on the top . yes you can not see how much is left . but i have had tubes that are not clear and you are in the same boat . at least here you have the best possible non-clear dispenser you could get . i have always had good skin so i do not need that much to have good results . it is not greasy nor does it have much of a fragerence . it leaves my skin feeling smooth and has made shaving easier and smoother . probably the q10 is a bunch of hype . and yes i usually buy sauve or 'swiss formula ' which are much less pricey . i can get 2 months out of 1.7 ounces . under $ 4 a month to feel great and help protect my skin ? worth it to me
0	it makes glasses stain . and i return it within 1 week
0	the slippers look nice and smell great . they were difficult for me to get on my feet . the lining was too restrictive . once they were on , they were very awkward and uncomfortable to take any steps . it 's unlikely that i will ever use them on my feet . i will only use the inserts for aromatherapy
1	these wipes are strong , have just the right amount of moisture , and do n't leave that slimy feeling that most of the major brands leave . my son had diaper rashes as a newborn ; when we were at home , we could wash/rinse him with water and dry completely before rediapering , but when we were out , and had to use wipes , his rash would flare up . after switching to these wipes and 7th gen diapers , the rash went away . later on , i tried pampers again , and the rash came back . using seventh gen really has kept his skin rash free . my older son also has a lot of itching when we use pampers ; much less with these wipes diapers
1	i encountered these at last week 's carlsbad triathlon . they tasted really good and i figured if it 's good enough for the military , i 'll give it a try ... sure enough , the military knows what it 's doing -- it seems to work as claimed . thumbs up , or , hooah
1	i have several of these glasses now . love them . they are strong and adjustable and so much better then wearing the granny cord around your neck . i wish there was a berrer looking sunglass besides that goggle looking one . good price and good product .
1	i bought this gadget with the intent of monitoring my daily steps to get an idea of where i was currently to establish some sort of baseline so that i could get a reality check on my activity levels . i opened the box , read the easy directions , set up my personal step measurement ( just measure off the distance of your 10 steps ) , and clipped it on my pants and forgot about it for the day . i was surprised to find out that a corpse could probably move around more during the day than me ! over the next 6 days , ( this pedometer keeps track of 7 days of steps for you ) ; i literally stepped up my game and went from 756 steps with no aerobic exercise on day 1 , to 7,880 steps with 30 minutes of nonstop aerobic exercise on day 3 ! every day has been getting easier to achieve the 10,000 `` normal '' steps , and increasing the aerobic steps too ( which are tracked separately ) . i can press the mode button , check out how many miles my steps translate to , kilocalories burned , aerobic steps , and compare it with the past 7 days as well . it has turned out to be even more fun than what i originally bought it for . i actually feel better , and the fun part is that i am trying to beat my own personal record from the previous day ! this has been an eye-opening experience for me , and i keep this on or in my pocket all the time now , just to make sure i keep a mindful eye on my steps and aerobic activity for the day
1	now i finally have the look and feel of a celebrity . the best product on earth period ! i 've tried all ingrown hair product 's since 1985 beleive me ive ' spent thousand of dollars , nothing comes close to it `` forget about it '' saliylic acid is history in my book . sorry dermatologist their is a cure . i bought 1 bottle before christmas 2006 . since the new year 2007 started i 've already bought 2 bottle 's and i 'm spreading the word . do n't delay a smooth and perfect face is just a few days away . thanks to all who have complimented my slick and smooth face . j. diaz aka ( papi rico
1	since having back problems , especially waking up in the morning , this lumbar extender works wonders for my back . i can easily have a good start for the day from now on ! ! many thanks . b
0	the pick at the back of the unit is curved and does n't work well . the floss is multi-stranded and tends to come apart when used and does n't feel like it is very high quality floss . the head is also somewhat small or poorly shaped so it is also difficult to use . i used the plackers brand before and was much happier with it
0	printed all over the box are the words `` with infrared heat '' . the instructions state that you must add warm water to the machine before you start , and the infrared mechanism is supposed to maintain the water 's warm temperatures . this would n't be the case . the water cools in a matter of minutes after turning the bubbles and massage functions on . turning on the infrared light on top of the machine looks nice , but does nothing at all to keep the water warm .
1	i bought this product because i had one from years ago that i use when i go to the gym but lost . it 's great at drying me off while i 'm working out and yet the towel is n't wet . i am conflicted though . i bought this one when i lost the one i already had . it 's a bit thinner and not the same deminsion as the original , but i still like it for what it does . i also like the little bag that it comes in , which i did n't have with the original one
1	i used to own a brush from another manufacturer . it never brushed well : the heads wore out waaaaaaaay too quickly . i just never felt i was getting a good brush . after using this brush for about a couple of months , i went in for a regular checkup . my dentist told me my teeth had never looked better . that 's all the testimony i need
1	tastes great , and it 's good for a normal weight training person like me
0	absolutely the worst cream ever ! after about a week of using it , my skin turned very red and then gray/brown ! i developed severe wrinkling and my skin became rubbery and loose . i went to a dermatologist who did a biopsy and said that i had developed elastolytic granulomas over the area where the cream was put - the elastin in those areas was destoyed and there was a scarring like pattern of collagen . the normal architecture of the dermal/epidermal junction was also lost - causing melanin from the epidermis to fall into the dermis - basically causing permanent discoloration ! dont listen to the false hype on the net - that hype is coming from people trying to make money off this stuff - take the advice of someone who has actually used this product - copper peptide products are not good for your skin
0	i 've been using trimspa x32 for over a year and , with a decent diet and regular excersise , i 've lost over 40 pounds . the x32 formula has helped me maintain my weight with no side effects at all . i , too , decided to use trimspa energy because it was new and improved , but was sorely disappointed . the engergy formula is way too high powered ( 200mg caffeine per pill ) for me and has made me feel `` sped-up '' , sweaty , greasy and just plain gross . and that 's taking under the suggested dosage . i 'm sure that it will help drop the pounds for you ... at the expense of dilated pupils , shaky hands and acting sketchy . i do n't think this pill should be legal and should come with stronger warnings . i 'm going back to the other formula tomorrow ... that is if i can get to sleep !
1	this is the one i buy for friends and the one they use at my pediatricians office . it is like the one i bought 5 years ago with my first baby , the one that is still humming along . i have been really happy with our thermometer with the exception that it was-and-is still too big to use with my second child , a boy who persists in having 'tiny ' ear canals even though he is three now . it has worked well for every other kid i know though . about the variation in temperature taking . my advice is to practice taking your and your children 's temperature while you and they are healthy . for one thing , not everyone has the `standard ' 98.6 degree normal temperature ; and for another thing it is n't always easy to get the tip pointed in the right direction once it is in the ear canal . it takes practice . a good home purchase . ( for really little babies we used a pacifier thermometer with great success .
1	good for dust storms in desert-like environments . great for looking suave . very convenient for easy on/off .
1	i took `` my '' unit to a monthly meeting for seniors . their machine broke i took mine as a replacement . they liked it so well , they had me buy this unit for the monthly meetings . they like all the different aspects of the machine . a suggestions could be to include a card that you could carry in your wallet write down the date the numbers from the machine ?
1	i have never used a roller . after reading the reveiws i decided to purchase two set of rollers . i have long hair . it works really great on my hair . looking at my hair everyone says it looks beautiful
1	27 ounces is a nice size , the bottle is light ( can be dented ) , and water stored in it tastes very good ... .and that will be even more welcome in the summer when a hot plastic water bottle in the car will taste lousy ! another reviewer mentioned a squeal ... ... that would be while twisting the cap on or off . i 've gotten used to that . wish it was just a hair thinner to fit in my toyota cupholder ... that may not be an issue with toyotas that are newer than mine are ( 10 15years ) . in the car , on the nightstand , in the canoe or kayak ... ..it 's working for me
0	this product might do for a backpacking weekend with the boy scouts , but compared to a blade razor , or even an electric , it leaves a lot to be desired . i recommend giving it a pass
0	it 's a handy mirror for the price but if your looking for a good vanity mirror , i suggest looking for something larger with a higher magnification . the light is not great at all . it 's very dim . one of the good qualities of the mirror is that it 's cordless and comes with an adapter if you do n't have batteries handy
1	i have been using kiss my face olive oil soap for years , and i wo n't let any other soap touch my face ! i found it when i was searching for a soap that would n't make my skin itch all over after a shower . i can tell you that after years and years , my sensitive skin has never once itched after i used kmf ! the soap is mild , with a neutral scent , which is a big plus . it cleans great , but does n't leave my skin dried out . the 8 ounce bars are a bit large , but worth the wait until they shrink down to a size that 's easier for us smaller-hands people
0	i do n't have a particularly large skull but these barely fit together on the bridge of my nose . i do n't see how the manufacturer can claim one size fits all ; as i said i do n't have a huge melon like mike myers 's brother in `` so i married an axe murderer '' . the idea/concept is great but ... i 'll probably return them . unfortunate because i was really looking forward to using them . people with really big heads , caveat emptor
0	i 'm sorry that i ordered these online . i should have tried them first . they do not fit round heads . no matter how many times you adjust them they do not fit . the bow needs to have an adjustment too . the magnet is not that strong when put on a round head they just pop off . would not buy another pair .
0	if you 're interested in the chrome model to match your stainless steel appliances be prepared to constantly polish it due to the water spots . my friend owns one and at first i was envious , but now i rather be less fashionable than freak out over the visible water spots . this model has the same shape as the riviera and as i stated in my other review althought it is ergonomic , the riviera collects algae on the bottom of the pitcher so i would be skeptical in buying this one . the only reason i gave it two stars because it ultimately looks cool but you ca n't avoid the water spots and it may be algae friendly .
