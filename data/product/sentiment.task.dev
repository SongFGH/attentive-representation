1	i was pleased with all purchase . i did not feel that i was given enough consideration on shipping costs as a very old and loyal customer . in addition for reasons that are not clear to me , i continue to get duplicate orders , or the order is sent to an old address . the return process in this circumstance is cumbersome and communicating with you and receiving a cogent response is quite difficul
0	i am in great shape . however , i can not get over that so many men 's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension . obviously they are made in china where the average waist is about 25 inches . the idea of `` medium '' as marketed is ridiculous by healthy american standards . my body fat is low . i am not profoundly muscular bound . as is common in men of my age , lower back problems are not unusual . i have a 32 '' waist . is that not `` medium '' sized ? i think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether . one size fits all does n't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems . the draw string is fine . it allows flexibility . so what if your pants fall down ? it seems to be the fashion , anyway . just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary , uncontrollable constrictions . also , these boxers do n't hold up well to any kind of washing . they looked like crap after the first time i washed them . i wish i could get a refund because i wo n't wear them again . my life partner told me they looked like `` old men 's '' underwear . that is sad and embarrassing because i agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry . i am not a mean hearted kind of guy . so , i am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again .
1	the service was expedient and the bras fit perfectly . just what i expected and wanted
0	i bought these shoes to do aerobics in . they look good and are comfortable , but only to walk in . there is zero arch support and when i walk in them i feel as if my feet are flat on the ground . there is zero shock absorption and no cushion for doing aerobics . my old shoes that are 8 months old has triple the cusion of these new ones , but i ca n't use the old ones . the gym on the base here do not allow dirty shoes . they are 8 months dirty full of sand and dirt . i am really let down over this as it took me three weeks to have them delivered to my remote location . now i have to look again
1	there are n't many articles of clothing that allow people to support their favorite team , as well as appear smart and sexy at the same time . red sox hats , however , are just such an item . go sox
1	fits great on my ipod nano . does not slip off like other silicone covers . pretty durable and great protective piece for the nano . con : do plastic cover or protection for the screen
1	i bought these slippers as a christams gift for my 16 year old daughter , she was very happy to get them as i guess they are the `` in '' thing for teenagers in her school . she loves them and actually wears them to school they are so comfy ! price is high , but they are well made and will last much longer than the typical slipper , these are more like shoes than slippers . the sheep skin wool lining is very sturdy luxerious
0	the fast delivery and reasonable price for these shoes almost make me ignore the not so perfect pair of shoes i received . they look like some floor model and somewhat tried on with part of the heels on both shoes cut off resembling rejects . i am sure i will not show them off much when i wear them
1	i bought these for my son for christmas , they were first quality , arrived in time for christmas , and at a great price
1	this shirt is a dressier than the usual shirt jacket or big shirt . it is unlined , has a bit of stretch for comfort , and is just slightly fitted to prevent that big blob shapelessness of some other courduroy shirts . i think it runs true to size and matches the color on-screen . i bought this as a gift for a friend who likes the comfort of big shirts in the winter , and maybe she can have that comfort even at work with this shirt . it was almost thirteen dollars then , but i have seen it for less than ten which would be a really good deal
1	at first i had my heart set on a different cloak , but when it was no longer available i decided to go with this one . i am very pleased that i was not disappointed . this cloak looks and feels beautiful . it has a nice button closure at the neck , and for those that are petite it is floor length . this cloak is just what i was looking for to add a last minute touch to my halloween costume . it is very comfortable and soft , no itchy feel here
0	i got the largest size they had ( size 10 ) and my toes were crunched in . they fit my mom just barely , and she 's a size 8. i wanted to get my money back for it , but it 'd probably be more money just to ship the incredibly small slippers back , then it actually costed to begin with .
1	the product was as advertised and delivered on time
1	this item was a great buy , fast delivery and was given as a gift ... thank
1	like wearing a moccasin only with more support . more supple than most driving shoes , and light weight too . soles wear very well , as do uppers . a great looking shoe that has become my favorite knocking around shoe , yet plenty dressy for evenings eating out in southern cal
0	beware , this item is not a zip front hoodie as the item description says . it is a pullover !
1	this is a very sexy pair of underwear . guys : if you 're new to the thong/g-string scene , this is a good place to start . i recommend g-strings because there 's less coverage on the back which makes them more comfortable than thongs . the reason i did n't give it 5 stars is because it 's pretty expensive but go ahead and splurge on one fancy pair of underwear . your girlfriend will love it . mine did
1	i love these shoes , they are so comfortable and give great support . these are my second pair . the merchant got them to me really fast and i appreciate that . though when i ordered i thought the amazon site specified free shipping so i was surprised at that
1	i love these shoes and so does everyone who sees me in them . i am the envy of the girls at work
0	one of the pairs of magnets that is supposed to keep the flap closed are oriented in such a way that the same polarity face each other . genius ! not . the result - the flap would not close and leave a gap that just keep on repelling each other . grrr ... one more thing , only the screen is protected by a clear plastic . the wheel is not
1	these are my single favorite pair of underwear . not your typical jock but much more comfortable and stylish . i 'm in the military so at first i thought `` thongs are not for `` real men '' but after wearing these i found they are , and a lot more guys wear thongs and jocks than you realize . i wear these for every day activivties , sports , work , and leisure . there is n't much fabric so they 're great under jeans and my girlfriend thinks there sooo sexy . after wearing them for a while it 's like nothing is there because they support you only where you need it . if you 've never owned a thong , i think you should give these a shot.i definately recomend the 2xist y back thong
1	not only are these shoes great looking on ... they are extremely comfortable . i went back and bought two addtional pairs in different colors
0	i purchased this scarf as a christmas present for my daughter-in-law . it was so cheap and thin it was mailed to me folded up in a 9 x 12 envelope . i had to go out at the last minute and purchase a scarf at a department store . i would have been embarrassed to give her the pashmina scarf . it was a wasted of money
0	these look and feel good but the little nobs do break off pretty quick , ruining the shoes completely . do not buy them .
1	this is a beautiful shoe by rockport , but beware , it runs really narrow . i even went a size up from my usual to compensate . i ended-up sending them back anyway . so if your foot is on the narrow side you may enjoy this sandal
0	the jacket is cut undersized , typical of foreign makes with poor quality control . the lining in the sleeve keeps coming ot at the wrist which interferes with activity . exterior shell has nice feel , but overall , a poor piece of work
1	this is a very nice leather bag . it has two pockets in the front that the flap goes over . the pockets do not close and i have found that you can lose things out of those pockets even with the flap closed . that is the only problem i can see with this bag
1	these black satin isotoner slippers are extremely comfortable and fit extremely well . they are flexible enough to mold to the shape of your feet but strong enough to cushion your feet , as well . they are well worth the purchase
0	nice looking picture but what are the dementions of the thing ? it looks good but is it 4 '' x 8 '' or 12 '' x 8 '' ? sure would be nice to know the size before i buy ... ... ... ... . da trol
1	if you have the body to show for it , by all means wear it alone
0	turn around time to receive item was good . material of the shirt was sub-par ( very thin ) for the price .
1	very nice sandal , lookes great with a dress or jeans . low enough to wear for hours at a time , but high enough heel to make it look chic
0	i purchased this skin to accompany my daughter 's new mp3 player . we managed to tear the skin first thing out of the box even though we were being careful , or so we thought . i expected higher durablity
1	i love birkenstocks and when i saw the eaton clog at such a low price , well , say no more . once you know your size , you can buy birkenstocks from anywhere . i just never expected to find them on amazon.com . they 're a little dressier style than my usual bostons and i just love them
1	i love this bag ! i purchased the pink/chocolate color and i get alot of compliments on how cute it is . i am in my early 20 's and i have a 2 and half year old and this bag can hold what i need for him as well as my things and still not look bulky or overstuffed and at the same time , is very stylish . i really like those trendy baby bags for those young moms , but they are very expensive . this is lightweight , made of cotton , so very easy to clean . i chose standard shipping and it came so quickly . i am very satisfied with my purchase
0	i ordered 4 toddler long-sleeved tees ' in the same size , i thought . when i received the shipment , all 4 tees ' were different sizes [ even though they were all labeled the same size ] . i have returned the items since the tees ' run two sizes too small , and the workmanship is questionable , which translates into ... that i will not be able to give this item to my loved one for christmas .
1	this swim jock is a great all around jock . very durable and very comfortable pouch and straps . mine has taken a beating , and has not fallen apart like other jocks i own . the swim style is cut very low in front , with a fairly small pouch . not only is it great for working out under your workout pants or shorts , it actually turns out to be a very sexy pair of underwear for everyday or play . the low rise cut pairs very well with low rise jeans , not to mention the barely there skimpy factor . heat it up a little and try this jock under your low cut jeans ... ..looks and feels hot ! if you 're looking for a jock with less coverage and a lower waistband or just a comfortable sexy pair of underwear , this jock is a great buy for the price .
1	was delivered quickly , was priced right , and folded up into a small size so i could stuff it into a suitcase before going on vacation . when unfolded it held more than the suitcase . high quality material and excellent workmanship . i think i 'll buy another one for a spare
1	this is the most comfortable sports shoe that i have worn and i own just about every brand made
0	you can use this case for storage which is what i do now . it does n't allow me to click the buttons , the bottom two since it squeezes it already and it 's down so i ca n't access them . overall , it 's ok for just keeping your player in there . i really recommend an invisible shield , it works better than this case for sure . this case is a bit bulky , but it 's alright if you do n't mind taking the player out to press the buttons to change songs and put it back in . sometimes when you put it back in , it will accidentally press one of the buttons which can be annoying and pretty much is . basically , if you want a case to keep it in this is n't too bad , but another product is better for sure . either my case was jinxed or they are all like that .
0	i bought these for my younger than three month old son , he did n't even move around alot and in the morning the fabric that the snaps are attached to would be ripped off from the shirt . i ended up having to throw them all away or keep sewing them back together . i do not suggest that anyone buy these
0	on sept 17 i ordered a cashmere wrap . i finally got the company 's attention when i placed a negative review on this forum . i was told if i removed the review after recieving the item , i would be credited for shipping . the item arrived oct 16 . as of today , november 20 , my credit card had not been credited . i emailed the company and was told the credit should appear in four to five days .
0	the bought 3 polar fleece caps and they are all one size fits all , but either i have a big head or something becuase it does n't cover my ears all the way . as for my husband that actually has a small head it fits him fine . so i guess if you have a big head do n't get it becuase it will not cover your ears .
1	i love this umbrella . it 's just the right size and works perfectly . it 's so pretty that i do n't want to get it wet ! !
0	this is a very styling money clip , however , it is not like a big paper clip . it opens like a butterfly , then closes together with the strenght of the magnets . it feels that your money and other cards might fall off . i 'm not sure if the magnet could wipe of your credit card information
1	after all these years buying this wrangler product this by far has been the cheaper price that i 've ran across . i love it .
1	i bought these for my husband and he loves them . they 're well made and super comfortable . he liked them so much he bought another pair in a different color . highly recommended
0	the robe does not fit me . i wanted to return it , got a return item number , got busy , and did not get it in the mail soon enough . they have a strict 30 day return ploicy . nordstroms does not do this . i could exchange it there . sorry i got a job and not time for petty rules . i will go elsewhere next time
0	i was very disappointed with this bra . i would definately not recommend it . if you are looking for a good and supportive nursing bra try the maternelle bra instead . this bra looks sexy , but does not offer the support and coverage needed for a nursing bra ( at least not for a size 38dd )
1	this is a wonderfully comfortable and good looking pump especially if you 're looking for a slightly wider toe box . it looks great with a skirt or slacks . my only complaint is that after finally accepting that a wide width is the most comfortable , and kindest to my feet , i ca n't find my size ( 6.5 w ) in navy . i have the shoe in black . if anyone from naturalizer is reading this message ; how about making more sizes and colors in wide widths available
0	this bag is so cheap looking i am embarrassed to use it . when i saw it online it looked identical to a us luggage bag i bought at tj maxx , which was stolen . so , i was very excited to find what i thought was the same bag on amazon to replace it . when i got it , i was shocked at how cheap it looks . the handles especially are plastic leather and just hideous . the return policy through ebags is such a hassle that i am just going to keep it and use it for bringing my laptop to and from work , but i will still need to find a better travel laptop bag . i 'm very disappointed . if you 're looking for a professional looking laptop bag , this is n't it . i should have known better for the price , but like i said , i thought it was the same as the other us luggage bag i had , which was gorgeous and i loved it . oh well .
0	this is an okay jacket . the padding in it is okay . sizes tend to run a little smaller than normal . there is no liner , and you will get cold riding at night . overall the jacket has only 2 layers , and if you hold it in front of you you can see through the mesh . spend a little bit more and get something that will hold up
0	i ordered a pair and they were too big ... so when i asked for a rma number to return and get a smaller pair they said they could only snail mail me a ups lable ... one month later it did not come ... each time to emailed customer services they said they could only smail mail it and not email it to me ... . whereas i know it is do-able.. bargain outfitters can as well as can online shoes .. so finally i paid $ 15 to send the boots back . on my dine.. and no doubt they will not reimburse me for my $ .. i not only had to pay shipping to get the boots but also they will no doubt chaarge me a re-stocking fee . i will never ever buy from the sportsman 's guide again ...
0	after wearing the betula birkenstocks for about an hour , the snap button kept coming undone near the buckle . happened pretty much every 10 minutes when i walked . midwest wont take them back since i wore them .
0	apparently there is an error in the item description . these are not gore-tex and are just about as waterproof as a seive . i new they probably were not waterproof when i put them on and saw my socks through the mesh upper but desided to test them out anyway ... stupid me .
0	i bought this as a surprise for my wife . when we opened it , i thought that 1 ) we were shipped a pillowcase by mistake or 2 ) they had n't finished it . edges are raw and unfinished . it is a complete waste of money because returning it will mean that the shipping both directions will cost me more than the dress cost . i understand that `` you get what you pay for , '' but this was a piece of garbage . this dress in the picture is obviously pinned and pulled back to give it any shape whatsoever . the picture does not accurately represent this item at all . this will fit like a potato sack , folks . i notice that the `` raw edges '' are now listed as a `` feature . '' ahem . in a recent e-mail exchange with them , i was told that ( their words now ) : `` quality is a subjective issue . '' they have pestered me to change my feedback and i have challenged them three times now to point out any inaccuracies in my feedback , and i would absolutely recant them . in their defense : my money has now been refunded . now ... anybody want to buy a pillowcase with three holes in it , worn for 90 seconds ? it would have been off sooner , but my wife was laughing too hard to get it back over her head . wish i could rate as a `` zero
0	ordered gray , they shipped black . since it is from canada i 'm not even going to waste return shipping charges . minor inconvenience , yet still folks , i ordered gray ! pants are also not new , the tags are ripped and torn , it looks like return or wholesale merchandise . i feel cheated , angry , but mostly just disappointed . for shame people , for ... .shame ... .
1	these are so great , and keep my baby 's feet warm . she even slept with them on with no problem . she 's been a master at getting her socks off up until now . they also protect her feet as she is starting to stand and was breaking toenails . she 's chewing on the toes but i have n't seen any scuff marks yet , so they are holding up very well
0	i bought this dress because i thought it looked so good on the model in the photo , but i should have taken into consideration i couldnt see the front . the boobs on the dress were very weird and pointy , and the ties up the back looked awful . it might be good for someone with a different figure than mine , but i think my boyfriend would have been more amused than aroused if he had seen me in it
1	ordering was easy , arrived in 4 days , gloves fit , well and good quality , good buy , recommend to purchas
1	my baby is large for her age and wears 6-9 month sized clothes even though she is only 3 months old . i ordered two of these hats sized 6-12 months . they are way too big for my baby but will probably fit her when she is actually 6 months . hats are made of t-shirt fabric and look just like the picture . you do have to tie your own knot on the top . andrew christian sent each hat in a separate envelope and they arrived on different days , but within the shipping time specified
1	i 've got really sensitive feet and i get blisters really easily , sometimes within 5mins of wearing a new pair of shoes . my quest for the comfortable ballet flat has ended here , after months of searching ! the heel is nice and soft but there 's still sufficient support here ( for me that is . for those of you out there with back problems , it might not be sufficient ) . i got them in the gold , which is a gorgeous pale lame , and am currently lusting over the black :
0	i was informed in october that the item was no longer available and my account would be credited . i think maybe i should check my bank statement for that time
0	i am in great shape . however , i can not get over that so many men 's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension . obviously they are made in china where the average waist is about 25 inches . the idea of `` medium '' as marketed is ridiculous by healthy american standards . my body fat is low . i am not profoundly muscular bound . as is common in men of my age , lower back problems are not unusual . i have a 32 '' waist . is that not `` medium '' sized ? i think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether . one size fits all does n't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems . the draw string is fine . it allows flexibility . so what if your pants fall down ? it seems to be the fashion , anyway . just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary , uncontrollable constrictions . also , these boxers do n't hold up well to any kind of washing . they looked like crap after the first time i washed them . i wish i could get a refund because i wo n't wear them again . my life partner told me they looked like `` old men 's '' underwear . that is sad and embarrassing because i agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry . i am not a mean hearted kind of guy . so , i am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again .
1	i 've been buying these sandals for 30 years . i just love them
1	this is a well made rugged coat . sort of a north face/ mountain hardware coat for the farm/ ranch . not a summer coat too heavy ! ! ! the next model needs to have pit zips !
0	this hat is not suitable for a small child . it is way too big and the material it is made of is too hard and stiff . if i had been there when it arrived , i would have sent it back
0	even for only $ 12 , these were n't worth the money . they came smelling extremely strongly of turpentine , or some other noxious chemical and now , at least 2 months since i have received them , the smell has not dissipated . they are extremely stiff , so even if they did n't reek , i still would n't wear them b/c my feet would be in tatters by mid-day . i guess that 's what i get for buying cheap shoes
0	i purchased these sandals thinking they would be comfortable and because they looked like they were made of leather . they are more like a vinyl material and are stiff and not attractive . they will be returned .
1	love these little gems ... perfect at 1 size below normal size . you wo n't want to take them off
1	these shoes are so comfortable and cute ! i 've gotten a lot of compliments on them , and i like their old-school pony look
0	i want to start by saying fred flare- shipped this product very fast ! ! and the transaction itself was very smooth . i do however , have extreme problems with the product itself . the product is not leather , its nylon , and it sort of looks cheap ? the inside material is sued , but that 's only the lining for the base of the wallet . also , the wallet part is very hard to use . you cant really put too much in the wallet- the credit card slots are a little too snug , and there is no place for my i.d . the wallet included a small `` note book '' but it also does n't fit in the wallet ? i was very excited about this product , but now i feel duped . the pictures made the wallet seem like it was of higher quality , and that it was user friendly , but it 's not . i do not recommend this product
0	would love to order these , but sizes are not clear . does small fit a toddler , is small a size 7 ? not sure how to order .
0	i ordered this wool wrap at the beginning of december and never received the item . i am disappointed that this seller is ripping people off and plan to report the fact that my money was basically stolen from me . if people ca n't be honest in their transactions then online buying will eventually die out . two thumbs down
0	not as expected , too short , nothing special for the price - took forever to receive ( about 3 weeks
0	i love vanity fair . their bras just fit me perfectly . when this bra arrived i quickly found it was not vanity fair . not only that , but it was made of the most rough and uncomfortable material . i tried it on in hopes it may fit . it was the most uncomfortable bra i have ever tried on . not because of size . it was bulky , rough and obviously inexpensively made . the tag said something along the lines of , `` made in hong kong .
0	i have yet to reccived tham so i can not review tham till i reccive them . thank you , robert but
1	my daughter 's school requires that they where white knee highs with their uniform . i had an awful time searching the net to find any until i came across these . they are very soft and comfortable . my daughter only wants these types of socks from now on . but from a mom 's point of view they are hard to keep white . even with soaking in bleach i ca n't get out any of the foot wear and tear discoloring . other than that , they 're great
1	recently , i took a motorcycle trip from atlanta , ga to ft. lauderdale , fl . unfortunately , i did n't have the option of riding at night when it was cooler and with my thermometer on the bike showing between 100 and 110 , it felt like riding through an oven with a hair dryer set on high blowing in my face . i also did n't have the luxury of air conditioning so to simulate this so i would pour water on my t-shirt and let the wind cool it down . after getting home , i recalled seeing a demonstration of a cooling vest that you soaked in water for a couple of minutes then wore under a jacket , preferrably mesh . i was amazed at how well it worked in the demo so i went online and ordered one . the particular model i ordered from amazon is the deluxe evaporative cooling vest in black . it came about a week after i ordered it via usps priority mail . they offer several styles and colors , including some that have removable sleeves the outer shell is quilted black nylon with 2 outside , zippered pockets and a zipper up the front . the neck has a velcro closure so it can fit snuggly around your neck if you want . the inner liner is blue and is 100 % nylon taslan , a water repellant fabric , so it keeps you from getting all wet wearing it . out of the package , it weighs just a few ounces but when you put it in water , the special material , called polymer embedded fabric ( pef ) , between the inner and outer shells absorbs water and the vest ends up weighing about 2-3 lbs . you only need to soak it for about a minute . there are spandex panels on either side that allow for some for expansion . i got the large size and it fits great , not too tight , not too loose . once the water is absorbed , the instructions ( on the tag in the vest ) say you can wring it out or use a towel to blot the inner liner dry . not being like a sponge , wringing it does n't do a lot of good so i 'd suggest blotting if you need to . while the inner liner is water repellant , there might be some water on it right after you soak it so putting it on might get you a little wet but if you do n't soak it too long , the inner liner will be relatively dry . the material that holds the water does n't expand like a sponge , it just holds lots of water ... it 's pretty interesting stuff . the first thing you 'll notice after a few seconds is that it 's cool to the touch . the principle of it relies on the cooling properties of water as it evaporates and it really works . i have n't had a chance to ride with it in sweltering heat yet , but putting it on under my mesh jacket and riding without a windshield kept me nice and cool . i do n't think i 'd like to try it in anything less than about 65 deg ( f ) because i 'd probably freeze nor would i want to use it under a leather jacket unless there was some way for the jacket to let wind flow through it . the inner liner stays pretty dry but you might get a little damp . the cooling effect will last several hours depending on how long you soak it and if you want to put things in the front pockets , they are lined with the same material as the inner liner so they 'll stay relatively dry . one thing i 've found though , it 'll take several days to completely dry out unless you ride with it . the water is very slow to evaporate but once it does , the weight goes back down to a few ounces . bottom line , i highly recommend getting one of these if you routinely ride in hot weather . they 're an inexpensive way to keep cool and they 're stylish ( except for the hi-vis lime green ) . wear it under a mesh jacket and you wo n't know it 's hot outside .
0	the other reviewer is spot on . these are pretty ( but not truly mirrored ) and they broke after only 4 weeks use . i bought a pair of aviators at a gas station that was made of much sturdier materials for half the price . definitely not worth the $ 16
0	these pants were washed one time , following the washing instructions , they were not put in the dryer , and they shrunk not only around , but lengthwise . i had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and did n't have any problems . i look forward to your reply
0	i had this bag on my wishlist and got it for christmas . i wanted it for when i take daytrips to the beach . i am really disappointed with the size . it 's pretty deep , but not very wide at all . no way i 'll be able to take everything i need to the beach in this bag . still , i 'll be able to use it for other things
1	my mother loves these pants . i know they are for men , but she loves the way they fit her . they are stain resisnt and that makes them that much better .
1	my husband thought this was a great shirt as an avid golfer .
0	i have ordered this coat 2 times and returned both coats . i 'm very disappointed . this is supposed to be a reversible coat . however , the hem of the black side is too long . consequently it hangs below the hem of the bronze side when reversed . and , it does not look good at all . the company needs to revise this pattern
1	this is the the most comfortable and motion limiting sports bra ever . i highly recommend it
0	these pants did not look good on me . they seem built for thin people . while not obese , i am not a stick figure either and these just did not flatter me . the material is nice , though
0	and no customer service on weekends at even before xmas
1	these are great socks . in the description it mentions that they fit sock sizes 10-13 . i assume that is the same as shoe size , but it is not explained . this , however , is an important point , since i wear a size 10 shoe . i can wear the socks and i really like them but i wish they were a little smaller . one size does not fit all .
1	nice , soft leatherette . the inside is roomy , and the pic is fairly accurate for the size to body ratio . the tie-front detail stays so , you do n't have to worry about it unraveling or loosening . nice silver buckle accents on strap . great
1	the presentation of the product is claer and attractive and the product is durable , comfortable and goodlooking
0	i ordered what should be my size and what is my size in all my other lingerie . there 's there 's zero stretch in this , it was difficult to get the panties over the hips and then the waist is big . since they 're short from crotch to waist anyway , it does n't much matter . the top fits better , since you adjust it . the cut is still quite poor and , again , there 's no give to the silk so it feels tight across the shoulders . it 's one thing for lingerie to be snug in the hips or bust . it 's another when the cut is so bad that the shoulders are a problem . if you 're narrow through the hips , shoulders or bust , this combo will probably be a nice fit . if you 're curvy , you might want to rethink this . it 's a shame since it comes in plus sizes . maybe i should have ordered up about two sizes but it should have been better made and a truer fit imo
1	arrived fast and in time for v-day ! thanks for your high quality product and its fast arrival
1	i love my soft and comfortable green robe that i received last year for mother 's day ! whenever i wear it , i want to just relax with a magazine or watch tv , and then fall asleep in it . the matching green slippers complete the feel , and i really feel pampered . i never knew i could feel so good wearing a robe , especially since i was not really a robe wearer before receiving this wonderful plush robe ! this is such an excellent product and great gift !
1	this is the best brand of slippers i have ever owned ! i have a cute pink pair that i slip into the minute i get home . they have lasted for several years now , and they are still in good shape . these slippers are so comfortable , and they stay on my feet without any effort . they are very soft and keep my feet plenty warm , and my feet never sweat in them , even without socks ! this style runs large , and i wear a 1/2 size smaller than my normal shoe size in these slippers . after wearing them the first week , i noticed they got a little roomier , but they still stay on just fine . they are my only pair of house shoes at the moment . i just ordered a new pair in a different style ( in pink , of course ) , and i have no doubt they will be just as good as this pair was to me . try dearfoams and your feet will thank you
0	this coat was listed as camel , but when it arrived it was actually tan . even the tag says tan . i was disappointed because it was the only christmas gift that i had for my husband . i never would have ordered a tan . also the coat fit like a whole size larger . i had to return it and it has been well over a month and i still have not received my refund
0	i bought these slippers as a present for my husband for christmas . i ca n't return them because he wore them for a day . these slippers were so badly made that he is wearing his old slippers . the shape of the sole on the right foot is the same as the left . do n't waste your money
1	shoe pretty true to size , good shoe for the money . i buy nike shox often and decided to try these for the price . not as cushy as a nike shox but also half the cost or less ! for the price it is a comfy shoe and i would recommend it if you have wider feet and or do n't want to send $ 90.00 and up for shox
0	i am still waiting for a credit to my credit card account . the item was not available and they said i would be credited . still waiting !
0	this shoe looked nice and stylish , but turned out to be very narrow ( even though i 've ordered it in size wide ! ! ! ) and uncomfortable . also had some glue marks on it -- i had to return it
0	i have done a review on these socks already , which has not appeared . they are not a good buy
1	just got them in the mail today . as other kenneth cole reaction shoes , it runs one size larger . i 'm usually a 12 but i ordered an 11 and they fit just right . these boots look great with jeans . the color is a bit darker than the one shown in the photograph .
0	i purchased two of these sports bras based on brand , price , and product description . this is a very uncomfortable bra for runners . the seams chafe and it does not `` wick away moisture . '' the slow shipping did n't help my opinion either . it is a nice bra for less active endeavors .
1	i ordered this boot in a size 7 , pewter . very cute boot and fits perfectly . very comfortable fit and feel . everyone who saw them wanted to know where i got them ! simply darling boot
1	i was unable to find my size in local stores and located this product on amazon for less than $ 30 , retail price , even on sale , was $ 60 . the jacket arrived in about a week . its nice and warm , very good quality . the upper torso/shoulders and elbow patches are covered in a heavy nylon which repels water and will help it hold up to wear and tear . it fits great and looks good . only small complaint is the elastic draw string around the bottom which cinches at the side and is a bit too long so it sticks out a little . but all in all i 'm very pleased
1	my baby loves his new kicks ! ! they came quick and would recomend them to anyone
1	hesitantly , i ordered my first pair of folk readers ; now i 'm back for a second pair . they 're comfortable , unique , well-crafted and the company offers excellent service - a winner
0	too bad there was n't a rating of 0 star . this is the worst piece of junk i ever bought . first of all we were looking for a brand called sports afield . this item fell under it when we did a search . when it arrived it was some off the wall brand.they were paper thin but thought maybe they were warm being it was from an army and navy store . wrong ! ! ! ! ! ! ! they served no purpose at all.were not warm at all . .we washed them per directios on tag and shrunk so bad i do n't think a 2 yr old could fit in them.do not buy ! ! ! ! ! ! jun
1	i like this fragance and the shipment was awsome , i did n't know what they supose to be here and when i check de tracking it was like delivered and i check my mail and it was there ! awsome awsome awsom
1	not very pretty but the comfort makes up for that . i am on my feet all day and used to wear reeboks , nike etc , i decided to try the crocs and have not gone back ! ! ! its like walking with slippers on . i have been wearing them for about 7 months or so and just recently tried my tennis shoes again and barely made it through the day . by that night my feet and back were hurting so bad i didnt want to do much but sit down . right then and there i made up my mind to never go back to tennis shoes again ! ! ! i do wish they were a little cheaper so i could add all the colors to my wardrobe . buy them you wont be sorry ! ! stay away from the look a likes they are nothing like the original crocs in comfort !
1	i got my adidas adissage wht/pnk sandals in record time . i was able to take them on my trip with me as intended . also , the price was the best that i had seen on the internet .
0	the elastic in these shoes makes them too uncomfortable to wear . otherwise , the quality of the lace shoes is good . i 'd wear them if the elastic did n't dig into my foot ( i have small feet too ! )
1	i was asked by my daughter to get these for christmas . i got some for myself for my morning walks in -30c temps . they do not muss up my hair for the rest of the day , even when i have just gotten it done , and keep my ears toasty warm . great product and worth the money . my daughter is equally impressed .
1	this is a great item to have if you are loosing weight . you can adjust the belt as needed without having to buy new ones
0	i ordered these white tank tops and 3 colored tank tops . i have never received these white tank tops and have requested a refund and requested another size they had in stock and have received neither . i have sent emails requesting this and still no resolve
0	company sent me two of one shirt and this shirt . i ordered 3 different shirts . this shirt is large in size but very short ! not what i had expected . asked the company to fix the problem with the shirts as they were christmas gifts for my daughter . i received a fill form two weeks later with no correction to the problem .
0	i 'm just not too crazy about this thing . does n't quite fit right or look right ... at least i only paid 5 bucks..
0	the cheaper variety at walmart ( $ 8.92 versus $ 19 and up ) , no boundaries brand , is better for me due to the fact that they are harder and more firm , more like a birkenstock cork sole which i also find very comfortable , for me anyway . they do last longer too and are not affected by heat in any way . walmart also has a real color explosion going on . you can get some really wild color combinations which give the shoe have a little personality for those occasions when you feel the need to express yourself . so , for the cheaper price walmart offers , i feel the value and quality exceeds the more expensive brands out there . if you are looking for a firm birkestock type sole , the no boundaries brand croc is a shoe-in , no pun intended .
0	when i purchased this , i was under the false impression that the idea of a silicon skin was to provide the unit with some shock protection in the event that it were to get dropped . the skin is so thin , that it does nothing but keep a little bit of dust off of the buttons . the belt clip is made of brittle plastic and broke the second day that i used it . do n't waste your money , spend the extra bucks to get something that will last a while .
0	the pajamas are way to long . they look like they were made for someone 7 feet tall
0	these socks are okay , but after one wash , they were covered with so much fuzz and didnt look good . so the next pair i washed it with hand and dried alone to avoid the fuzz . also they are too warm socks
0	are customers to guess what is a `` small '' size compared to a `` large size ? '' is the small for a todder , pre-schooler or teenager ? what a waste of time trying to find information on this web-site about the sizes .
0	i am ex us army , national guard and army reserve . i did not expect to receive dress web belts made in china and taiwan from an army navy store . i have other belts made in usa that are heavier materials ( belt and buckle ) . the belts have lasted 10 to 12 years and the buckles are still good as new ! i ordered 3 belts with buckles thinking i would not need to buy a new belt for the rest of my life . the web material is very thin for a belt . the buckles 2 out of 3 are stamped made in taiwan and the 3rd has a sticker says made in china . they are cheaply made and are likely to break or snag clothing . i will not recommend this product to anybody . after shipping this junk cost me $ 47.00 !
0	i am a 38 ff , and i was hoping this would help hold me in while running - not ! this bra is no better than my 18 hour bras and is double the price ! i 'm still in search of the bra that will hold me in ! this one is going back
0	i bought this bra because the ad says 100 % cotton . there is no cotton in this bra . it is 86 % nylon and 14 % elastane . if you want a cotton bra , this is not for you
1	i was very satisfied with my purchase of these items.reasonable price and am very happy with items
0	easy to install . we used it for less than a month and it no longer rotates- you can still hear the engine running , but no movement . hardly any use at all- maybe 10 times . we tried taking it apart to see if something simple was wrong and the screws are set so tight you ca n't open it to see the inner workings . i have never received a bad item from amazon before- i am very disappointed with this product .
1	every time i wear this tie , it always strikes up a good conversation of the way things were , and when cartoons were cartoons . also working in a place with a lot of kids , they tend to be more at ease when they see me with this on . i 've had this tie for 3 years now , high quality , and does not stain really easy ( at least for me , great quality ) . only downfall , a little dated with a 32 cent stamp . kids do n't notice , and neither do most adults . worth picking up , great price
1	purchased these for my husband . he absolutely loves these sandals . he initially thought the little nubbies would feel strange . however , he got over that thought fast when he slipped them on and went tromping around the yard . he uses them for a quick slip-on shoe to run outdoors . wears them every day . thanks for a nice slip-on ! also these are sturdy though very light weight
1	i 'm the type of guy who has never bothered to buy slippers . i run around the house in socks . i 'm getting a little older now and my feet seem to get cold , plus i run outside to do quick things like grab something from my shop , turn on the water for a tree or plant , etc ... things that normally require me to slip on some shoes . these slippers are very soft , but have a substantial enough sole to step a few steps outside without worry . the light color and porous surface do tend to stain easily however , but so far i 've managed to wash off the toothpaste drips and such ( laugh with me ) . yes i 'd recommend them for now and will let you know later how they held up
0	i returned this bra to exchange for size the day after i received it in october . it is now january and i have not yet received the replacement . i have called several times but to no avail ! i ca n't give a good review of this product because i have n't actually gotten to wear the bra
1	soft , durable , breathable fabric . perfectly flexible for vigorous practice . i 'm glad i bought these
0	really uncomfortable . i wore them twice and then threw them out . they sagged like a sad pair of tights you used to wear when you were little . and they became transparent like they were going to rip at any moment . not worth the $ 5 i paid
0	i bought this wallet for my niece and then ended up returning it . the quality is poor . the wallet is really hard to use because the compartments do not open all the way . also , the wallet actually looked fake ( not sure if it is ) because the xoxo is upside down . you can not tell from looking at the picture .
1	these boots are gorgeous ! i got such an awesome deal on these boots ; i searched online for about an hour to find another website that has a picture of them ! i 'll put one up here . they 're comfy , rich leather , well made . i 've always wanted frye boots
1	i love the shoes , very comfortable and i can wear them with just about anything
0	boots run about a size too big and unfortunately it cost $ 20 to return/exchange
1	very smooth transaction and timely delivery . first time on-line shoe buyer . i tried those cute shoes on at a local shoe store and loved them but was not willing to pay high price for them . i saved about 35 % by purchasing here !
1	i love these shoes ! they are so comfy and look good . the price is a bit steep , i think , but considering i could wear them practically every day and not get tired of them , i guess they are worth it . definitely considering purchasing another pair in brown !
1	got this for my father . he loves it . great coverage . easy to use
0	ordered mens 6.5 for my son , shoes are sized a womans 6.5 ( say mens 6.5 on box and shoe ) . i 'm going to have to pay $ 6.50 to return them for a larger size . do n't waste your money , buy nikes
1	the robe is very warm and heavy , perfect for cold mornings and the `` just out of the shower chills '' that you get . it doesnt quite have the `` luxurious '' feel of a spa robe , and the thread loops are matted in certain areas , but quality wise it is better than anything else i 've seen for similar prices . the length is much shorter than pictured . i bought this for my boyfriend , who is 6 ft , 190 lbs , average build , and it comes just above his knee ! all in all , it 's a decent robe for the price and he likes it .
1	great price . i have another pair of these shoes i bought elsewhere at twice this price . very comfortable . true to size .
0	poor quality , belts do not fit correctly , can not be returned because it is swimwear according to policy . do n't trust skinny dip swimwear
1	it will definitely get her attention in the best possible way
1	well constructed blazer . great color . you can wear with jeans or shirt and tie for church .
1	i found this product to be of very high quality and the transaction of the product was great . i recommend this for anyone looking for great bag , especially as a gift
0	i just mailed those back this past week to beall 's in florida . however , when the mailman took it from my mailbox ( i am 83 and no car ) he brought it back the next day because of insufficient postage on it . there was $ l.71 due . so , i put ( 5 ) 39 cent stamps on it , which would have been $ 1.95 . however , the next day the mailman brought it back and there were only 3 additional stamps instead of the 5 i had put on it . i called the post office , and fortunately , the postmistress believed i was being honest , and told me to send it back with the mailman . he was n't a happy camper , but i did send it back , and i trust that she went ahead and mailed it for me . i was concerned that it might have been too late for an exchange . other than the fact that the pants were too large in the legs and around the hips ... .they were okay , but by that time , i had changed my mind about them , too . also , i had bought these with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and never could find a place to apply it . jeanne alle
1	very warm and comfortable for the price . for any price , really . nice , looks good , feels comfy , keeps warm and cuts wind without reducing hearing in the least
1	the carhartt a110 cold weather merino wool socks were a gift for my son . he has been very happy with them , keeping him very warm in the cold of wyoming and colorado . i would definitely buy another pair for him and maybe for myself
1	this is the best sports bra i 've ever had ! i show dogs for a hobby and was always aware that , as i gaited the dog around the ring , i was bouncing ! now , no more bounce and extreme comfort . i 've had the bras for over 6 months now and they 've held up well . everyone that i 've recommended the bra to has had similar experiences
1	the slippers were perfect , exactly what i wanted . the price was good and they were delivered sooner then i expected . i 'm very pleased with my purchase and it was so easy to do . thank you very much
0	the sling support feature on these underwear is practically useless . my testicles always slip completely out of the sling before i 've had them on for even an hour . if these briefs enhance a man 's `` profile '' at all , it 's because they 're so darn tight ; it has nothing to do with the sling support . and talk about `` low-rise '' -- the top of my crack is exposed even when they 're pulled all the way up . i 'm in pretty good shape , but if these things shrink in the dryer , i wo n't be able to fit into them anymore . my advice : anybody ordering c-in² briefs should go one size larger than what he 'd normally wear
0	had only 4 wks ... ... poss . washed 2x ( and hung dry ) and underwire is coming out of side and poking me
0	i had high expectations for these socks given my previous experiences with the brand . the socks were too narrow in the foot and too tight around the ankle . they are not comfortable to wear and overall , a big disappointment
0	i washed 'em and they shrunk up so small i ca n't wear 'em anymore , bummer
0	this is a nicly styled jersey that could use a fabric or fabric finish makeover . the plain polyester is rough to the skin requiring the use of an undershirt to prevent chafing . the collar is cut high enough to cut across the base of the neck leaving a nasty burn mark . a cotton , cotton blend , or silk would have made a better choice of fabric making this an unbeatable jersey for many uses
1	as an advanced exerciser , i am always looking for a new , innovative challenge . the firm body sculpting ball workout provides just that . this workout comes with a sculpting ball , which is available in three weights ( four , six or eight pounds ) . i used the eight pound variety , and by the time we got to the ab work , i was ready to put the ball away ! my arms really got a workout , as did my core . there are several moves that require you to hold the ball out in front of you , over your head , and move it diagonally across your body . i could really feel it in my core after the workout . once we completed several segments of standing work , including grapevine , squats , and lunges , we go to the floor for bridge work and abs . you have to hold the ball between your thighs during the bridge work , which i found challenging since by that time i was sweating and the ball kept slipping away from me . you also hold the ball between your thighs to do ab crunches , which is difficult with such a heavy ball . afterwards is a short cool down , which i thought could have been longer . tina leads , and she is very fit and quite personable . she cues well and gives a few form pointers along the way . as with all the new firm releases , the background is sterile and boring . there are four background exercisers , with allison showing beginner moves . allie is holding the eight pound ball showing more advanced moves . the music is nice and non-intrusive . beginners will enjoy this workout . it is n't complicated and with a four pound ball you could get a really intense workout . unless you 're advanced and have some good upper body strength , i would not recommend the eight pound ball . you could injure yourself if you go to heavy . in fact , i was wishing i had another , lighter ball for the floor work . i have all eight new workouts , and i 've done three so far . of those , i liked this one the best . i felt i got a good workout , but i wish it were longer . the entire workout from start to finish is about 32 minutes long . another 15 minutes would have been great , although i suspect my arms would have been totally fried if we 'd kept going much longer . overall , i give this workout high marks . it 's definitely a keeper
0	i purchased this item to keep my wife warm and cozy for the 12-hour flight to japan . however , it was way too thin to keep her warm . after using it for about an hour , we ended up packing it back to the case and use the blanket given to us by the airline . since i spent over 40 dollars on this blanket i could n't even throw this away . i had to haul it around for the entire trip . i do not think it is worth 40+ dollars . 10 dollars blanket would do the same ( or even better ) job than this
0	the skin is fine and all the extras were nice . the one thing i really needed was a good elastic band for the arm . this product does not have a good elastic band . it 's too thin and not durable enough
0	bad shoe for sure . it is not for running . but want a cheap shoe for some dirty yard work . this may d
0	i ordered this dress and when i received it , i thought that it was very pretty . when i put the dress on , it was completely see through . you could see my bandaid on my thigh . i would not suggest this dress for anyone based soley on the material . it 's a shame because they dress is very flattering and also comfortable . it would also be impossible to wear anything under this dress ( including pasties ) because it seemed to show everything
0	i would not buy this sweater . it is flimsy , and not very quality feeling . the price was too good to be true
0	i bought this item because it said `` optional belt clip . '' the belt clip is only `` optional '' if you `` opt '' to leave it on and not use it . you can not `` opt '' to take it off . i would not call this belt clip `` optional . '' i would call it `` will ruin your new phone case if you attempt to remove it , '' which is what happened to me mere moments after taking it out of the paper envelope it shipped in
0	these gloves are very soft and seem to be made well , but they have a big flaw : the fingers are too short . ordering up a size may not solve any fit problems
1	i love my new steve maddens ! they are brand new as described and i received them verrrry quickly
1	i found these at lane bryant and i absolutely love them ! i wear them under my work clothes every day . you 've got to try them
1	i purchased this bre several weeks ago and found it to be the most confortable top i 've worn to date . since then i have purchased 4 more
0	i want to help overseas products , but this advertises itself as cashmere . it itches my neck ! cashmere does not itch . color was not represented appropriately
1	this top runs small , so order next size up . vibrant colors , nice fabric , comfy , attractive fit .
0	this bag is much smaller then i was expecting . the zippers do not open/shut easily . i was very disapointed
0	this bra works okay but the material is really uncomortable . the lace cups is n't feel like flour sack material .
0	oh my . it enhanced my rolls instead of hide them . it did not help having the bones sticking out above my butt , which was very noticeable . not worth the money charged for it .
0	judging from the picture , i thought this thing looked like a turban ! it actually has no wrapped fabric , but is a firmly fitting cap . hidden in the back is an elastic band that will adjust for larger heads , which is attached to the edges of an ugly looking triangular gap . aside from this , the coloring is too bold . old glory will select random coloration for each customer , but my selection has over twice the color variety as the one in the picture ! i do n't see how i can wear it without attracting stares
0	have purchased from this seller in the past with zero problems . this time was different . they sent the wrong shorts . i paid the shipping to send them back . i asked , please send the right shorts . they credited my account an amount smaller than i paid . and that was that . certainly not satisfied .
1	to echo another reviewer : i am a heavy runner with high ( semi-flexible ) arches and a neutral stride , running 20-35 miles per week . even though my strides are consistent in terms of length , pronation , and heal-to-toe gait , i tend to have very heavy footfalls ( being a former sprinter with muscular legs ) and need a well-cushioned shoe . i am training for the boston marathon and have tried asics gel kayanos ( the shoe designed for the `` clydesdale type '' runner ) , a pair of adidas adistars ( the newest model is a very good shoe but did n't fit my wider foot properly ) , and some various pairs of new balance ( least favorites of the bunch ) but the mizuno wave 7 's are by far the most natural feeling , durable , light-weight , cushioned ( without being bulky ) shoe i have ever owned . i have now owned two of the wave creation 7 's and a pair of the older wave creation 6 's and put a lot of miles on these shoes : they consistently hold up mile after mile better than any of the other shoes out there . the gel kayanos are the only shoe remotely comparable but i found that they break down far to fast for distance running ( and they are slightly heavy ) . that and the mizuno 's were comfortable from the first step and did not require any breaking which is very rare . i am confident i could switch to a new pair a week before a marathon and hardly notice a difference . i would not only highly recommend this shoe to anyone with medium to heavy footfalls and a high arch but i endorse it as the only shoe i will buy as long as the line continues .
1	this is really too small for me to use everyday but is great for times when i want something dressy . it is a very pretty little bag .
1	great product , works well and was shipped promptly also there was an accurate product description ... .thank
1	i got this jacket when it was $ 50 . i was very impressed at the quality and i like how it 's waterproof so i can just walk in the rain with it . great jacket and i think i will be wearing it for a long time
0	i bought a pair of these thinking they were only different in upper strap material . the footbed/sole is not cork like true birks , but some sort of composite ( rigid ) . birk straps are softer and birk corkbeds are more cushiony . i wore them around the house to see if they were comfortable and the footbed became marked - just from an hour or so . too bad because after that i knew i did n't like them . i tried on a pair of birk granada ( the style this is based on ) and immediately felt the difference . while these are about 30 % -50 % cheaper , i would have rather spent more on the original birks . i think these wo n't hold up as long and do n't offer the same comfort . also , you can have real birks `` repaired '' so they never really wear out . **black version has large `` betula '' on side in white
0	this is definitely not something i would want to wear while working out . even with mild exercise the lining feels sticky , and the fabric does not appear to breathe . i 'd rather wear cotton jersey pants than this . for cooler weather , i 'd prefer something like a good pair of tights ( sugoi for example )
1	my husband really likes the intimo men 's classic silk pants . they are very comfortable , and the color is really nice . he wears them almost every day ! the only complaint that we had is that the pants are a little bit short in length
0	these pants are fine if you have a very short rise , but i ca n't imagine that they would fit most people . i will be returning my order
0	have n't worn it yet to test the quality however , the structure is all wrong . one leg is more narrow than than the other ( i could barely fit my leg into it ) and the waist is really high
0	i received the trousers in a timely manner . they were what i expected although they did not fit . i returned them a month ago and have not heard a word from the company .
1	this bra is great for those of us with smaller busts . it 's the only bra i 'll wear under my t-shirts now because it does n't show the outline through the shirt like every other padded bra i 've found . it very comfortable . the only downside is that mine did lose it 's form ( it 's not as tight fitting as it used to be ) a little bit faster than some other bras . but , it 's absolutely worth buying a replacement . i just hope they never stop making this bra
1	i bought these boots when they were on sale . definitely worths the money ! they look great with skinny jeans tucked in , and they are really comfortable . whoever saw my boots loved them
0	i did n't like the material of this skirt especially the black and white one i do n't like it it 's feels it 's for old ladies
1	i bought a pair of these in tortoise and really love them ! they fit great , they arrived in great condition and very quickly . the rhinestones are really blingy in the sun ! i am buying a pair in black for my best friend who is in love with them also . very cute for the price
0	this wallet is so big for passport and don`t fit my documents from brazil . maybe is good for another country`s document
0	i ordered these based on the picture -- -a high cut brief . these are not the ones they sent me and now i have to pay to return them ! rip off ! ! ! zero stars
1	we loved this pair of sneakers for my 22 mo . old so much that we bought it in the next size up so that we/he could keep using them . they are so easy to get on him , and we all know some are so difficult . these slide right on while pulling the tongue . they are also wide enough for his `` flinstone '' feet , lol . they break in well for flexibility too .
0	when the product came it was torn and had one of the three pieces missing . i called the seller and they said all of the purses were missing one piece . i would not order from this seller unless you are not worried about all the pieces
0	i bought these for a bridal shower gift . they say one size fits all but they where like an xxxsmall . they torn right when they where tried on . very poor quality ! ! ! ! do not buy these
0	the shoes would have been awesome but ... .. the sizes run extremely small . i even ordered a size larger than normal thinking maybe this would happen . the shoes are still too small .
0	i just received this dress today . not only was it cheaply made ( there are rhinestones missing , threads , and it does n't flow smoothly ) , the top of the dress will have you falling out all over the place if you are in any other position than standing completely straight . also , the support is badly made . i have a very small bust , but i do n't think this would compliment anyone who is n't built like barbie . definitely would n't recommend . it looks great in the picture , but it 's not being modelled on a real person .
0	i have goddess bras , and it seems that each style has it 's own sizing . the love at first sight bra fits wonderfully , while this bra is about 3 cup sizes larger than what it is supposed to be
1	these jeans are extremely soft and comfortable . like most children 's place merchandise the quality is nice and cut a little larger then other brands . my only negative thought is that the material should be a little thicker . my boys are tough on their clothes
1	sexy and well made . i am a size 12 , but i bought the queen size and it fit great
0	the plastic screen on this case was very hard to keep clean , and very easy to scratch , so the view quality was horrible . also , the case was way to tight and was difficult to get the 30gb video ipod in and out
1	pupsqueak is wonderful . i am a picky mother about toys . i hate toys that are too loud , too commercial , too cheesy , too useless ... i have high standards . but pupsqueak gets my `` picky mom seal of approval '' wholeheartedly . here 's why . i am very blessed to have a mother who loves to send my children lots of goodies . while it 's easy to know what to send a 4-year-old with distinct likes and interests , it can be harder to gauge what a twelve-week-old baby will enjoy . we have no shortage of toys and gadgets to entertain our new daughter with , and she clearly enjoys some of them , kicking legs , cooing , , waving arms , etc . the pupsqueak , however , took it to a different level . she loves this thing . we showed it to her around 11-12 weeks old , and she immediately reacted . she laughed , she kicked , all the signs . then , she reached for the little black and white patterned bone that hangs down . we were so excited , and she 's had it attached to the bar on her carseat ever since . the real test , however , was our 10-hour drive from louisiana to kentucky for the thanksgiving holidays . but pupsqueak came through for us with flying colors : anytime she would get fussy , i could reach back and shake him a bit so he would jingle softly , and she would be happy again . after my arm would get tired , i 'd make sure he was adjusted where she could get at him , and she would , at not yet 4 months , bat at it herself . pupsqueak is a wonderful toy with a soft , gently jingle for young babies and a funny bark that even makes my four-year-old laugh for older babies . he is definitely top dog in my book
1	love these . i use them everywhere . i really ca n't imagine not having them , since my son throws down all plates and napkins still .
1	i purchases this basket for a friend . i was very pleased with its usefullness style . it arrived in two days of ordering
1	very efficiently drains about as much milk as i can get with the pump in style advanced for me , and very portable and easy to clean . i use it when i have a little more time or when i do n't expect to pump more than a couple ounces ( between feedings ) . despite medela 's warnings , i would say you could use this to pump daily , aslong as you are careful to fully drain the breast ( massage ) , but maybe not okay for maintaining supply for multiple pumping in a row
1	our son got these blocks when he was 2 months old . my husband enjoyed them more at first , but by the time our son was 5 months old he loved playing with these ! he probably could n't hold on to them well until he was 5 months old , so that is why he enjoyed them more at this age than earlier . at 10 months , he still enjoys playing with them . they have lasted through `` both '' children . i would highly recommend these blocks for infants , and so far even into the toddler age , he enjoys playing with them
0	i have three kids , and for the third time , i am utterly dissapointed with avent 's product . with each new child , we bought a fresh supply of bottles , hoping avent had fixed this problem . we really wanted these bottles to work , as they seem to be the most durable and stylish ones on the market , and our kids never had any problems with the nipples . however , each time , we ended up having to switch to another brand . the leak is not just a spot here or there . it is often a torrential downpour , leaking out the sides of the white cap . i know many people who have had the same problem . for as expensive as these bottles are , i would think avent would take more pride in their product , fixing such simple things as a leak . do n't waste your money
1	this product is good for your knees , however the suction does not seem to stay on well and the elbow part keeps slipping ... other than that it is good to hold small items like the toothbrush and toothpaste
0	my 15-month-old son pulled these off ( and broke one ) within about 5 minutes of installing them . also , he was able to turn the covers which ended up turning on the gas . bad design . do n't waste your money
0	i thought this would be a great idea to keep the jars in , but really , it took up too much counter space . i ended up putting it away and putting the jars into all the nooks and crannies in my cupboards as i personally do not have the space to waste for something that is completely unnecessary , i found . save your money
0	this is the flimsiest gate ever . to boot it is not cheap . i could n't even use the screws that came with the gate . i had to use nails and duck tape . the instructions were wrong about sizing it up to fit your area and it took me over 1 hour to put it together . unfortunately when i bought this gate , there were only 2 reviews posted - one was good and one was not so good . so i was a little confused but i needed a swing gate . so needless to say - i wanted to make sure that i put my comments on so that no one else will get swindled . this gate is n't even worth $ 1.0
0	first of all the diapers get stuck in the lid , and then the room starts to smell like baby poop . yes you can use reg bags for it , the only + about it . first day after changing the bag it smells ok but buy the 2nd wow it stinks so badly and when you open it to change the bag the smell is unbearable .
0	i ca n't begin to convey the frustration i felt when trying to use the refill . i struggled for 20 minutes trying to slip the too-tight bag over the cartridge . the diaper dekor works wonderfully as a single-use item , but at about $ 30-40 a pop , it is the most expensive garbage can outside of ted kozolowski 's apartment . the printed instructions were clear -- it 's just that they product does not do what it supposed to do
0	i just bought the dora folding potty seat today at walmart . it does n't cover the entire toilet seat . it starts at the front of the toilet , and does n't go all the way to the back . the result is that there is no support in the back . my daughter is 3 yrs , 4 months , and this seat is much too weak for her . any movement she makes causes the potty seat to sink in the back . i 'm afraid that if we use it , it will soon break and she 'll fall in . she definitely ca n't sit back , or even sit straight up because it sinks so much . i 'm returning it and i 'm going to look for something else
0	well , i just tried the bundle me ( toddler size ) with my 20-month old in our jog stroller for the first time today and i am disappointed because it is definitely already too small . he really ca n't sit in the bag unless his legs are bent , which he hates . plus , when i have the bag pulled as far down as possible in the stroller ( the only way i can get him in at all ) , then it only zips to just above his waist -- definitely not high enough to really get warm and snuggly . i 'll keep the bag for baby # 2 , but i 'm really disappointed i ca n't use it with my not quite 2-year old .
0	i 've used the diaper dekor since the birth of my now 7-month-old daughter and i loved it to begin with . very easy one-hand use -- step on the pedal , drop the diaper through the flap , very easy to tie off a bag when it became full . in the beginning , it handled odors well too ; even smelly diapers did n't cause problems . but as soon as i started feeding solid foods , things changed . it proved completely incapable of containing the ghastly stench of those diapers . my daughter 's room is at the top of our stairs , and the stench did n't just fill the room , it flowed out her door and down the stairwell , so we were treated to a powerful whiff every time we walked upstairs . i took to leaving her window open and the fan on to air out the room during the day and emptying the pail before bedtime at night in order to prevent it from stinking up the house . that lasted a week -- i just bought a new pail ( a diaper genie 2 ) and i hope that works better
0	i do n't know who jj cole made this hat for , my daughter had the tiniest head and it still did n't fit . waste of money
0	the problems i had with this gate : 1 . the instructions for using the template to install the hinges , for the fixed gate , was not easy to understand . i finally gave up and i improvised . doing so , the installation went more smoothly . 2 . the gate is not sturdy . if anyone were to bump into it , i 'm pretty sure it would break . 3 . the mechanism to click/unclick the lock is more difficult than it should be . fortunately , the people who will using it , have a strong enough grip to get it to work . despite these flaws , however , this gate does serve its purpose , in my case . i bought this gate to keep my dogs confined to a room -- - which it does . they do n't go near the gate , so fortunately , i do n't have to worry about them leaning on , or jumping on , it . as for the locking mechanism , it 's annoying , and i 'm just hoping it does n't get any worse . this gate would not be safe for kids
1	i bought this seat because we have a small eating area in our kitchen , too small for a full-size high chair . the seat has worked wonderfully from age 5 months to now age 21 months . i do find the seat hard to recline or sit up but i have only had to do that a handful of times as once you find the right setting for your child it stays there until he/she is ready for the next setting . the cloth lining is very easy to remove , wash , and put back and the plastic under the seat cover is easy to wipe clean . the tray is easy to put on , remove and again wipe clean or wash off in the sink . i have also found the seat easy to take on and off the dining chair when i need the chair for entertaining others . my daughter has never complained about sitting in the seat and , now that we are no longer using the tray but still using the seat as a booster , enjoys having her own place at the table . i highly recommend this seat for parents looking to conserve space in their dining areas but not sacrifice convenience or comfort .
1	the review before this one is what got me interested with this produce and so i decided to buy it and let me tell you , it was the best choice ever . i have no real experience with any other wipes , but have read reviews of all the promes other have given like wipes dry out or turn color ... that does not happen with this one . i love that i just put the whole pack in , plastic and all , and it stays nice and toasty for my son 's bottom . he loves it and no longer has to deal with cold wipes anymore . i love the spring inside to keep the wipes on top . i love that it heats from the top . the wipes never turn yellow and is always moist . i also love the little handle on the top , so i just have to pull the plug and easily carry it to another room if need be ! the product is hight recommended
0	once we took this net out of the box i knew it would n't work . our balcony railing was not only longer , but shorter in height , than the net so we had to wrap it around the top railing . the `` strings '' used to secure the net did not look strong enough to me and the whole set up looked ridiculous . i am searching for an alternative
1	we were just at the baby store to choose carseats and the britax marathon carseat on display had a gogo babyz travelmate attached to it . it was so easy to maneuver that my 7 year old daughter wheeled her 20 pound baby sister around the aisle for fun . two large , solid , screw-in knobs attach the travelmate to a backplate that secures the seat . the whole combination looks very sturdy and relatively easy to use . we bought both the marathon and travelmate . we were looking for a better alternative to the sit 'n stroll . this may be it . i can not compare the two options as i have never tried the sit 'n stroll , only read the so-so reviews .
0	these slipcovers are tooooo expensive to fall apart after one washing ! i bought two of these ; one ripped and the other is coming apart from the inside . i constantly have to cut the strings : - (
1	my husband is a nyc doorman so we found it very fitting to decorate our son 's room in this theme . since my hubby deals with taxi 's and limo 's on a daily basis we thought it was very cute that the main theme of this set had those things in it . we also love manhattan and are there often so we brought a little bit of it out to our house in l.i . the set is very well made and i like the fact that since it feels like it will last , my son can grown with it . it is also not too pastel and babyish that he can use it well into his toddler and pre-school years
1	i bought this portable tent for my graco pack n play because my toddler can climb out of it and i wanted him to be safe . we use this when visiting friends and relatives and it provides me with 100 % peace of mind knowing that he wo n't be able to escape and injure himself . it is easy to attach to the portable crib and holds very securely . my only negative comment is that it 's a little difficult to put together- i usually keep it assembled and throw it in my trunk to save time and my sanity .
0	i bought this for my three yr old and it does not work at all . we have the britax roundabout carseat and there is not enough room for the pillow . i returned it
1	i have this monitor now and i 'm thinking about return it back cause although i have the volume on high but still my baby 's voice still not clear but other than than it is a good monitor i did not have any problem with the battaries or stati
0	my seat is brand new and i love it , but it has already quick working . i 've changed the batteries reapeatedly and it still only works occassionaly . it wo n't vibrate at all and the music only plays sometimes . very disappointed .
1	i am nursing our 2 wk old , and it is just easier for me if our baby sleeps with us . my husband is always worried he will roll over on the baby , so , he does not sleep well . the snuggle nest has given him peace of mind and now he can sleep . also , the dvd has made him more comfortable taking care of the baby by himself , because he feels confident that he can calm our baby down without my help . i only wish we would have bought this with second child
0	even though i think this is a very good idea ( no mess to clean up like there is on a roaming stand-alone potty ) , the ring does n't fit our toilet seats well . we have the oblong seats , not the round ones , and the ring slides back and forth , especially when my 2 yr old daughter tries to get up on it . it does n't make her feel very stable so , so far at least , she has refused to use it
1	my son loves these blocks . we 've also purchased the number blocks to go along with this set . he loves saying the colors , numbers and stacking them
0	not only are probe covers unavailable in retail locations or over internet , it seems that first years has discontinued the product . at least the product is not listed or mentioned on their website . we searched for model 4290 - the number imprinted on the bottom of the thermometer . apparently , they do n't see any value in telling customers the product was discontinued . furthermore , the site is full of broken image links . the thermometer works well but without probe covers , it 's not a good investment . you can find equivalent products with readily available probe covers . if the store you 're buying the thermometer at does n't have covers there , find another product with covers available
1	this stuff works wonders for my son 's sensitive bum ... and fast ! we usually see results in just one application - usually by the next changing the irritaion is gone or nearly so . it also has a very natural/herbal scent which further outweighs other barrier creams . it may seem a little pricey on a per ounce comparison , but i 've found that i do n't need to use as much , which makes that argument mute
0	i bought this chair because it got such good reviews and looks great . i was so sick of seeing fish , butterflies and primary colors all over our house - the neutral tones were a sight for sore eyes ! but i 've been so disappointed in this chair 's function . with all the nooks and crannies in the buckles and straps , it 's impossible to keep clean . the straps and parts of the vinyl seat became so caked with food that i threw them into the washing machine - even though the tags says not to . the worst part of the seat is the tray . it 's ridiculously wide -- too big for my dishwasher and my kitchen sink ! ( and both are full sized . ) the way my toddler smears food on the tray , there 's no way i could just wipe it with a rag and be done with it . washing it turns into an exercise in hosing down my countertops with the sink sprayer . oh well , at least they get clean too ... also , i agree with other reviewers that it 's really difficult to slide the tray into place . i wind up shaking it around and my poor toddler looks at me like i 'm torturing him . on the bright side , the recline feature is wonderful for infants and babies who are just getting the hang of sitting up . overall , if i had it to do over again i 'd pick a simple fisher price..
1	i 've been co-bedding with my 5 month old son since he 's been with us , but we recently decided to move to a co-sleeper to give my husband and i a bit more space . i have friends who used it and read all the amazing reviews so it was a no brainer . we 've run into a few problems : first we have a modern platform bed that is low to the ground and even at it 's lowest the co-sleeper is several inches to high so we 've had to switch bed frames for now . second the co-sleeper mattress is rock hard and actually sits down about 4 inches from the divider- since i 'm used to having him in my arms for night nursing i did n't want to have to reach in and pick him up . we solved both of these issues by purchasing 2 portable crib mattresses . now he has a softer surface to snooze on and i can simply slide him over to nurse or roll myself right up to him ... we 'll have to remove one of the mattresses once he 's a bit bigger so he does n't fall out , but for now it works ! hope this helps ! *** i 'm adding this a few months after use- i like the idea of the extra space offered by having the co-sleeper attached to the bed , but our son is now 9 months old and has actually slept in it only a handful of times ... still prefer to have him in the bed with us !
0	i love this swing because it goes side to side , she can sit when awake , lay down when asleep , and once you put her in she is out cold . after 6 weeks of using it i thought the battery was going , but when i changed the battery the music was still slow and i still had to keep the swinging motion on high , two weeks later it just stopped working . i 've only had it for two months and hardly use it , just a total of 3 hours a day give or take a few
0	i 'm currently in the process of adopting my son , and i bought this to take to guatemala with me when i visited . it never worked - it did n't matter how much water i put in the chamber , it would never cycle on more more than 30 seconds . i then had to wait approximately 5 minutes for it to cool back down before using it for another 30 second cycle . i ended up filling the ice bucket with hot water , and letting the bottle sit in that to warm up . needless to say , it 's been sent back . i think i 'll just use the microwave when the baby gets home - it 's got to be easier and quicker than this thing
1	these are really good bottles . i have been using them for 4 weeks now for my newborn son . my only complaint is in regard to the stage 1 nipples they come with that you are supposed to use for newborns . the flow is much too slow . my little boy could not get anything out of it and he tried and tried . so if you plan on using these bottles , i would recommend going ahead and using the stage 2 for your newborn baby . i am not the only person who has had this problem with the stage one nipples . other than that , these bottles are great
0	does n't dry your bottles at all . it leave a condensation and does n't dry completely . i give it one star for all the stuff it holds , but water leaks out so you have to put something underneath it .
1	we got this chair as a baby shower gift , which i registered for and absolutely love it ! i do n't understand the problems the other reviewers are talking about . if used properly , this chair gives absolutely no problems . the seat locks in at different levels , if it 's not locked in , of course it will fall apart . the seat is easy to use , folds easily , and cleans easily . we store it in our van ( we have stow-and-go storage ) and it fits perfectly ! we 've used it since my son , now 16 months , could sit up . he lays his body from side to side and the seat does n't budge ... very safe . the tray does snap off easily , and he has done that at times while trying to climb up on it . this does n't bother me , since it 's not a 'toy ' and should n't be climbed on anyway . the tray has n't snapped off while in use , and hopefully wo n't ! we 've used this chair on both a chair , and the floor when seating was limited ( like at family get togethers ) . we have n't had any problems at all . anyway , i highly recommend it..
1	my daughter recently had her second child , and spends alot of time breastfeeding . this product allows her to pump at her convenience . she can have others hold and feed the baby while she spends some time with her other child . the product works very well . she said it takes a little bit of experimenting and adjusting to get it set to work best for her , but it is an excellent product . she previously had a less expensive product by another manufacturer , and heard how good the medela brand was from a friend . this brand is a pleasure to work with after using the less productive , noisier pump she had before . we would highly recommend this product , and the product is well worth the price paid
1	i 'm the mother of a 3 1/2 month old baby girl . i had intended to only breastfeed for the first year , but it turned out that my daughter had a very difficult time at first with latching on . so much so that she ended up taking in very little milk and her weight dropped nearly a whole pound from her birth weight in the first week . the pediatrician told us we would have to supplement with formula to bring her weight up . i chose the premium nurser bottles because they said they were good for switching between breast and bottle feeding . my daughter took well to the bottles , and even started latching on better when i did breast feed . i 'm continuing to use formula along with breastfeeding with no nipple confusion problems whatsoever . when people ask me if i breastfeed or bottlefeed my baby , i say `` both '' , and they tell me how lucky i am ! these bottles are a life-saver ! they 're easy to clean ( i use the top rack of the dishwasher ) , and my baby has n't had any problems with colic . i like the convenience of the disposable bags , too . and my daughter is now starting to `` help '' hold on to the bottle while i feed her . these are the best
0	i used these pads when i first started nursing . they did a good job of keeping me from leaking onto my clothes . however , my nipples were incredibly sore . when i took my baby to her first appt. , the pediatrician suggested cloth pads . what a difference ! yes , they did cause me to leak through a little , but that was needed . when all the moisture from let down is pooled up against your breast it causes sore nipples for some moms . do n't use these . buy some cloth ones instead that will allow your nipples to breath ( i use the imse vimse )
0	i was so excited to buy this stroller . it seemed perfect for my 1 yr old daughter . the mesh back would be ideal for the hot , humid weather . it 's light and easy to travel with . it seemed sturdy . most of this was true until i used it for a month . honestly , the seat is way too big ! my daughter was forever uncomfortable b/c the straps were too loose even at their tightest to hold her and the seat was too deep . with minimal padding ( and no recline ) she would bump her head on the side frame when riding around . and to top it off , the frame bent after basic use . all we did was take it in and out of the car ! i was very disappointed . maybe this would be a great stroller for a 4 year old , but do n't buy this stroller b/c you 're looking for something smaller than your graco ( but better than an umbrella stroller ) for your young toddler . i think for the price and minimal features it should be of better quality . every review mentioned the carrying strap b/c that 's the only extra feature ! this stroller was not for us !
1	having only used it once , as my baby is just now able to eat table foods when we go out to eat , it worked wonderful . having a clean place to put her food on was nice , as you never know just how clean the tables really are
1	well , i 'm sure this is probably a novel use for this product , but we bought this for our great dane to sleep on . he 's giant and old and needed more support that the traditional dog bed , but orthopedic giant dog beds started at over $ 200 . we got the idea to try a baby crib mattress , and ordered it . very soon thereafter i arrived home from work and was puzzled to find no dog blocking my way into the door waiting for a head pat ; it seemed the mattress had arrived and he was simply immovable . he loves it . it is well crafted and everything the ad said . our use is quite unconventional but it works well and we could highly recommnend this for anybody with a large dog
0	we bought this product so that i could see my 6 month old son from the front seat . but everytime i put the rear view mirror on the back window it would pop off and hit my son in the face . the blinds do n't stay up either . their suctions do n't stay if there is any moisture on your windows and when you shut your car door .
1	i registered for this item as one of those `` i would n't buy it but it 's a nice thing to have '' . i did receive it and am so glad i did . my son loves this ! ! he gets so comfy and warm and will sleep for hours in this boppy lounger . i would defninitely recommend this and would buy more if i needed them
0	i used this bag once when traveling and then the zipper completely fell off because it was improperly made , then i got a new bag ( customer service was very nice and helpful ) and it has a huge rip in the bottom after only traveling with it once and gate checking it ( my stroller was n't damaged ) , so i have concluded that it is horribly made and a waste of money , still waiting on a refund
1	this pillow has become my preganant wife 's best freind . she snuggles with this pillow way more than she snuggles with me
0	i had purchased the dr. brown bottles after the birth of my boy/girl twins in hopes of helping my son with his gasiness . they did help ease his suffering but he was also put on soy which seemed to help the most . by this point , both babies had become attached to these bottles and would n't use anything else . at first i thought i must be doing something wrong for them to continually leak , and sometimes pour out of the rim of the bottle . ( i have a total of 4 kids and have been through lots of different types of bottles , none this bad ! ) we tried everthing to stop the leaks - *using only all dry parts for each new bottle *not heating or storing in the fridge with the valve and stem inside *not overfilling after an entire year of frustration with these leaking bottles i noticed that when my son would hold it by the nipple or squeeze the nipple , that milk would come pouring down the sides ! finally , the answer to the leaks ! ! ! is truly a great idea and i hope they try to perfect it , but these have a major design flaw - and babies drenched with formula in the middle of the night is no fun . these items were meant for baby use , and for the price it should help make babies ' mom 's life easier . stick with avent or playtex with liners . thank you good luck
0	i purchased this bed online last year . it looks great and as we all know our daughters love dora . however , the bed was a disaster to put together and if your not handy , you would problably give up . the rods that come with the bed do not stay in the holes , and for a very active 3 year old this bed will not last 3 months . & lt ; br / & gt ; what a waste of money , invest a bed that your child can growth with , and something that will withstand the active lifestyle of the average child
1	these are one of two brands that my daughter does not soak through in the night . they wash up nicely and seem as good as the day i bought them . my only wish is that they had fold back laundry tabs for the velcro . they stick to other things in the wash . i think this puts extra wear on the velcro too
0	i purchased this item after hearing comments that a unit that heats from top down works better . i was highly disappointed with this unit as it does not heat the entire wipe , wipes must always be filled to the top and the wipe cools down too quickly . unfortunately i do n't have the original box therefore can not return the item . i am now going to purchase a warmer that is sold from one step ahead that also heats wipes from top down but is not something that attaches to a wipe box . through friends i have heard this other unit works great and have been reassured that i wo n't be disappointed . hopefully babiesrus will sell this other item in the future
1	i bought this as a gift - ca n't give much opinion - she told me she loved them , so i give it 5 stars . maybe that 's not a fair review , but it 's breast pads . they are always useful ! lo
1	i was a bit nervous about buying these covers after reading the negative reviews , but i did it anyway , and i 'm glad . the covers are durable -- the color has n't faded , and it still fits perfectly over the changing pad . i think they 're soft enough for diaper changing -- i would n't put my baby to sleep on it , but then , who would
1	the pacified pod isn 's `` essential '' , but it 's definitely good to have . you can keep the pacifier clean and easier to find in the diaper bag or in mom 's bag , or you can simply hook this on the stroller if you are just going for a walk . and with all the cute patterns , you can definitely find one that suits your taste and matches your stroller or diaper bag
0	we have this stroller and are n't really thrilled with it . in fact , we 're going to buy a different double stroller to replace it . our children are aged 2 years and 4 months . while the 3 month old was still in his car seat/carrier , this stroller worked well for him . he 's now out grown the carrier , and we 've put him in the seat of the stroller . the shoulder straps are too tight for him and do n't adjust well . the seat is n't padded well and there is no head support . our 2 year old does not like the back of the stroller . with the infant in the front , we have to keep it reclined , so my daughter has to lean forward if she 's sitting in the back . she hates standing on it because she is very short and she ca n't see anything . she would much prefer to sit in the front . we find that the basket in the bottom is practically useless . we ca n't reach it so we never use it . there is no cup holder or tray for the parents . it is also a bit bulky when folded and heavy . so , i think that we will put this stroller in storage until the kids are older and get a double stroller with 2 seats for now
0	this is such a ridiculous excuse for a toilet seat lid . it 's easy enough to install but hello ! what 's to stop anybody , especially a toddler from lifting the entire seat and lid together ? not a thing ! the `` kit '' that comes with it to secure it to the toilet rim is a joke in that it rattles around like crazy and when it 's closed , it does n't fit snuggly around the seat so it 's completely loose . total and complete piece of junk ! !
1	this diaper bag is a great urban carrier for baby items and can easily pass off as a regular messenger bag for every day use . * it 's functional and has multiple organizers , including a place for your cell phone , keys , and a zippered insulated compartment for baby 's bottle or a toddler 's drink . * for parents , there are two inside pockets with zippers that are perfect for wallets and other small items . the interior has easy stash pockets for storing diapers , wipes , and other baby essentials . * overall , it 's a stylish looking bag that moms or dads could use . the design is trendy without having an appearance that will become easily outdated . * after nearly two years of daily use , it 's still in good condition and shows little signs of wear . * it 's also a very convenient on-the-go type bag that stays put when you 're out and about
0	this diaper pail is affordable and uses regular garbage bags , both of which were important to us when buying a diaper pail before the reality of dirty diapers . even when we emptied the pail often and sprayed it with lysol between uses , it still smelled bad every time we opened it . sometimes the smell seeped out , so it made the whole bedroom stink . and my kids have no problem pressing the blue lid-popping latch-and , of course , adding their toys or other opjects to the contents of the dirty diaper pail . the twisting mechanism to remove the full bag is a great idea . it helps you not get the face full of odor when you open the pail ... but you can not let the pail get even close to full , or it wont twist . and after two years of use , the twisting mechanism does n't work anymore . the latch for the small opening is also broken
0	i had tried this for my newborn and i think this product is unsafe and not sturdy . the base of the seat is very wobbley , it would help to have suction cups on the bottom . and you do have to fill your tub about half way in order for your child to stay warm . also , when i put my baby in the seat and he is 12 lbs , the seat tipped backwards . i can imagine that it would be worse when my child is heaviear and moves around more . i do not think this product is safe . it would make a great product if they included a baby tub with it . so i returned the product and ended up with the 4-in-1 bath station from safety first that worked well with my first child
1	this is so much better than the bjorn carrier . you can wear it on the hip or in front . it is very comfortable . my baby always felt secure and i never thought he would come out . i could wear my 25 pound baby for 2 hours without a problem . my back and shoulders were never sore . easy to put on . great way to calm a fussy baby ! reversible black for men too
0	it 's a chunk of plastic with some bits of rubber attached . effectively serves its purpose , but for nearly 16 bucks ? ! ! puleeeeeeeease
1	i love this swing - my fussy first child could not live without it . i had my second child two years later and the swing is now really loud . i called fisher price and they said that the motor will wear out with use . so now mine sounds like a metronome - it clicks back and forth . if i had to do it all over again - i would still buy this swing b/c of the design . i just wish that fp would build a motor that was more durable and better yet - that plugs into the wall
1	this product was very easy to use , quick clean up , and very discrete to carry in public . my husband and i are constantly using it when we are out with our child . i especially like the compartment for diaper storage and wipe storage
0	i bought this item despite the review that said it was too small . big mistake . it is small ! it 's not big enough for my 21 months old . i 'm very dissapointed because i liked the infant version .
0	i got two of these as shower gifts . i thought that they would be so handy . wrong ! the velcro kept slipping and sounded as if it would fall off of the changing table . the openings that are shown holding the powder and lotion are very small . they will only hold the travel size or the next size up . it was made cheep . the `` shelves '' are not sturdy at all . save your money !
1	our hungry pelican is now on child number three and shows no signs of wear despite being a favorite crib toy for many years . the bright yellow velour pelican ties onto the crib railing . his fat cheeks squeak , his wings crinkle , and his feet rattle . he comes with four sea creatures ( crab , shrimp , fish , and octopus ) that are each different textures and colors , and make different sounds ( rattle , rustle , etc. ) . children can put the little animals into pelican 's mouth and watch them drop down into his tummy . the large circular tummy opening allows for easy removal of the animals so play can begin all over again . i found that babies enjoy quietly investigating the sounds , colors , and textures of the four little sea creatures . toddlers progress to the eating game . i am grateful to mr. pelican for allowing me an extra half hour of sleep every morning . what can be better than that !
0	we purchased storkcraft 's rochester stages crib in natural , aspen changing table , 5 drawer dresser , 3 drawer dresser , 2 side units ( left and right ) and a hutch . every single piece of furniture that we 've gotten from storkcraft is damaged in some way ~ nicks and scratches and paint on a lot of the pieces . on the side panel of the 5 drawer dresser the piece is completely cracked . it 's obvious that storkcraft has no quality control . we 're in the process of deciding whether or not we 're going to return all of the furniture or just get replacement parts and/or a new unit . all i 'm going to say is do n't waste your time on purchasing storkcraft furniture
0	reasons why i do not like this potty : 1 ) the shield falls off with one touch , ussually into the potty ! 2 ) the potty has many cracks and crevices in the bottom that collect pee in numerous ways . 3 ) it is cumbersome to empty the potty . 4 ) once the shield is lost ( since it impossible to keep attached ) it is hard for boys to sit down and not make a mess . i highly recommend that bjorn potty since it is all one piece and with a built in shield
0	i purchased the peg perego aria stroller last month for my 3rd son . needless to say , i have lots of experience in the stroller world . this was my first peg perego stroller purchase as i have used graco and maclaren in the past . i had been using my maclaren umbrella stroller ( which i purchased in 2000 when my first son was 6 months old ) and thought i would buy a new stroller since the other was a bit old . my girlfriend recommended the aria so i purchased it . anyways , it was a huge disappointment . the steering is awful . you definately need two hands for this stroller . the stroller is also extrememly `` wobbly '' . i was shocked as i figured such an `` upscale '' brand would be quality enough not to wobble so much . the 5 point restraint is hard to stay in place as the back straps are attached into a little `` envelope '' type holder but it always comes out as there is no device to actually secure it in place . it is bulky in that it does n't fold into a small compact stroller . i used this 3 times and just gave it away ... what a waste of $ $ . i 'm back to using my maclaren , which looks thrashed but is a wonderful stroller . i could kick myself for wasting the money . my advice to you is test it out before you buy it ! ! ! ( do n't rely on the name
0	though this potty is nicely priced , it 's worth it to buy a more expensive one . though mine has n't fallen apart like other reviewers , it does shift around on the base , allowing for spillage . the removeable receptacle in the base is way too far from the actual seat , so my daughter gets stuff all over the inside , not just in the receptacle . the inside has a criss-crossed honeycomb type pattern ( see my customer image ) so it 's impossible to clean messes out of it . it does serve it 's purpose as a potty , but i 'm definatly going to buy a different one when my son is old enough for one
0	i bought these for my daughter thinking that maybe they would n't leak like the last ones i had used . they do n't leak , but the stage 1 is too slow and frustrates her . she 's 5 months and the stage 2 is too fast . they made a huge mistake in not making more stages . had i realized this before i had used them , i would have taken them all back
1	my mother-in-law bought these for my daughter . at first , i was skeptical about how entertaining they would be , but my daughter took to them right away . in the beginning , she would just chew on them and smile at the quacking duck noise , but now she interacts more and seems to love feeling all the different textures . she also loves to knock them down when i stack them up . they wo n't entertain her for hours , but she 's always thrilled to see them when i break them out for the first time that day
1	unfortunately - the baby i bought this for already had one ! but i got to see it in action , and listen to the parents rave about it ! it is really neat - almsot to the point i wish i had kept it for myself ! !
0	i agree with all the other reviews saying the warmer with burn your hands and overheat the bottle . especially when you only have a few oz in the bottle . the water in the warmer actually boil when it heats up and if the bottle got stuck in the handle , it means you have to use your bare hands to separate the boiled bottle and the boiled handle . you end up having a boiled hand as well . the worst part is it will burn your love one ... . not only that , the cooler does not close well so the content will not really be kept fresh even the ice-pack is frozen before placing into the cooler . we switched to avent warmer . a little more $ $ but it is much better . i would not recommend this product
1	other parents told us about these , specifically the vanilla scented ones . baby # 1 was bottle fed and took to an advent pacifier right away . we used the scented soothies whenever we could n't get a bottle ready fast enough for her likes . not sure if it was the shape of the soothie pacifier or the scent , but she always calmed down wihle we 'd finish getting the bottle ready . baby # 2 was also bottle fed , but did not take to any pacifier right away . we tried these regular soothies as well as the vanilla ones and the advent ones too . she eventually took to the advent . it really is up to each baby what they will like . but these are definately worth trying . in addition to the regular and vanilla ones , there are also various sizes , including preemie , pacifiers attached to small stuffed , plush animals that are easier for babies to find and put into their mouth ... and also easier for mom dad to in the back of the car , the darkened bedroom , etc
1	this jogger is great - i love the quick fold feature and my daughter seems very comfy in it - no complaints , in fact she seems to look forward to going on runs w/ mo
1	this crib has been a smash hit with our baby girl . not too big yet roomy enough to spread out . she loves sleeping in her crib , and we like the size and convenience . not sorry for the purchase ! carl
0	after three weeks my brush broke too ! can not find a replacement , i do not want to buy a whole new rack . design fault that they should correct . not good enoug
0	we love this monitor , but only when it does not have awful interference . unfortunately , in the evening for some reason the interference is really bad and all we hear is static off and on for hours . we do not live in an apartment or townhouse ( which i read was not recommended for this product ) , but we do have wireless internet . only we are n't using it when there is static , so who knows ... i love being able to see my boy , but the static makes the monitor really annoying
1	my daughter ordered this to go with the crib shield system . it 's a nice addition to the system and looks very nice
1	my baby is now 5 months old , and we 've been using the halo sleep sac since she started moving around more . i was always worried with the regular blanket because more than a few times she would wake up crying because she had kicked her regular blanket onto her face ! now , i never worry that she will soffocate or that she will be cold in the middle of the night . this product really gives me peace of mind and i 'll be sure to give this to any new parent friends
1	i cringe at the idea that i fed my baby from heated up polycarbonate bottles . i might not be able to breastfeed my baby , but with my new glass bottles , at least i know that i am feeding her the purest form of formula i can possibly give . she hated the taste of the latex rubber nipples so i bought some silicone ones and was successful . when i consider the epidemic of autism in this country , i am dedicated to buying pure , organic baby products and avoiding using plastic products especially when heating in the microwave .
0	i bought this stroller last year when it went on sale at a local story . luckily it was a floor model so it was even further discounted . i bought it because it was lightweight , had a front tray , adult drink holder and was in a very stylish orange color . i was looking for a stroller with all the features of my full size gracco but light weight and smaller to put in my trunk . well , after a couple weeks , i changed back to my umbrella stroller and use my graco for longer trips . here are the negatives i experienced with the peg prego aria : - poor steering . can not handle quick turns . - sun shade only works for direct overhead sun . - 5 point harness is poorly designed . the plastic hook is always coming undone and gets tangled . - my drink holder broke . - overpriced for features and quality . my positives are : - nice looking - easy to fold - lightweight i keep this stroller in our attic now as an extra stroller for when we have company . thankfully it folds up small and does not take up too much room ! i would not buy a peg prego again
0	if you research the toxic gas theory for crib death ( which has been around for 15 ? years ) you will see that this item can produce toxic nerve gases just like crib mattresses can . this product is not safe at all , no matter what they call it . get a babesafe mattress cover to prevent toxic nerve gases from getting to your baby , and use only 100 % cotton on top of that ( between your baby and the mattress cover ) . do not use polyester fleece or acrylic blankets or comforters and use 100 % cotton blankets . run from this product
0	i 'm a big believer in reading amazon reviews -- customers rarely lead me astray ! but this chair ( which we bought specifically because of everyone 's praise ) is miserable ! i do n't understand why it got such high marks ... the tray is way too huge for easy cleaning and it ( rather than the chair ) has a `` leg separator , '' which means you ca n't set it down anywhere without it tipping all over the place . we 've also found that the tray can be extremely difficult to hook onto the chair , and does n't push in towards the baby 's belly far enough . in addition , the clips that attach the harness are filled with grooves and ca n't be cleaned well , so they 're beyond gross , just after a few feedings . of all the baby things we wish we 'd never bought , this is number one on the list ... i ca n't help feeling that if we 'd just closed our eyes and pointed at random to a high chair , we would have done better than this thing ... the only reason it gets one star is because i appreciate the non-obnoxious print -- it 's nice to not have something on display with clowns or fish or teddy bears or bright colors . ;
1	overall , we are very happy with this product . i like that it covers the entire side of the crib and does n't come up only partway like a traditional bumper . also , i like the breathable netting since baby can see out through it and since it `` gives '' a bit when baby pushes and kicks it . we have a nonstandard length crib ( babee tenda ) , so we do have small gaps at each end of the rail , but we had read about this issue in another review from a babee tenda crib owner , so we knew up front we would have these gaps . these small gaps have not been a problem for us as our baby does n't seem to want to stick her legs through the gaps in this location ( i think it 's difficult since she would have to lie almost flush with the headboard or footboard to do so ) . the white satin edge is very pleasant to look at . overall i like this product much more than the traditional bumpers i have seen .
0	i will not buy these again . they are tiny , thick and do not tapper on the edges . this means you will see the lines thru your shirts . the adhesive is n't enough and the pads shifted durring the night . i highly recommend the lansinoh or medela , they cover more , are thinner and stick better .
1	i bought this w/ the hippo travel high chair . it worked great and kept things cleaner . unfortunately it was in the case w/ the chair when it was stolen out of our truck .
1	i purchased your `` space saver highchair '' for my 9 month old daughter who is severely disabled . finding equipment for the very young disabled child is very difficult . this chair works for everything ! this chair is so comforatable for my daughter and allows her to sit up and play with her toys as she gets very bored laying on her back all day . she also has a very difficult time playing with her toys as her grasp is not well controlled and she is constantly dropping toys on her face or off to the side and can not get them back in her hand . i love this chair for its size , the way the whole seat tilts ( not just the back ) , and the 5 point harness . the chair is also small so it holds her very nicely . my daughter loves nothing more than to sit in this chair all the time
1	this bib does it all and there are no complaints whatsoever ! i used to go through 8-10 bibs every few days , but now this is the only bib i use every day , all day ! easy to wash , catches everything so there is little mess on or around my child and it 's easy on , easy off !
0	i have looked at alot of other reviews before i bought and wished that i had n't because . you ca n't go off someone else 's experience , you really have to experience it for yourself . first of all it 's too bulky . the suction thing on the tub did n't stick and it was in the way when i tried to shower and kept falling down . my poor baby kept sliding because there is no non-skid at the bottom of the tub , so i had to go out and buy a small mat to put at the bottom . i bought this tub only because my baby was out growing the fold away bath chair but it looks as though i will have to continue using it and buy a larger one for her . i was very temped to send it back but i 'm just going to sell it on ebay . i 'm sorry but it was a waste of money for me . i 'm happy that it did aleast work out for the other moms , maybe mines is defected !
1	now that i 've caved to the power of pink ( it only took three girls for me to finally give in ) , this turns out to be very cute and was the second cheapest i could find . quality seems fine ( two weeks post purchase ) and who does n't love a tool that keeps the kiddo safe and calm while one does dishes or makes dinner for the rest of the brood ... ? for the first babe , we were given a different seat that aimed to be an improvement over the classic and very simple bouncy seat , but had so many functions it was basically useless . this is a case , though , where the basics are the best . in looking around for a new one , saw many for $ 100 ; if you can stomach the not-as-posh aesthetic , this seems like a great value for a seat that will only used for a few months , anyway
1	i have a home daycare , so this chair is used constantly . i 've had two of these for well over a year , and today i bought a third one . i 've tried several different seats in the past and this one is the best by far . nothing beats the swinging tray . i would recommend it to anyone
1	i have used several monitors in the past 7 years and chose this one due to the walkie-talkie feature . it works well and has a great range . the vibration is a nice feature so that you can turn down the sound when you have company and are having a conversation ; no one else has to hear your little ones settling down for their sleep
1	as i am not personally using this , i can only pass on what i have been told . it does a great job of trapping odors and making terrific sausages which are easily thrown away
0	i gave my father-in-law a couple ideas for my son 's ( 1 year old ) christmas gift and this was one of the items . boy do i regret giving him this as an idea . it is a cheaply constructed toy . the bus 's hood does n't even work correctly . the toy does not do much of interest and it constantly makes this annoying noise ! the toy held my son 's attention for less than 5 minutes . my suggestion to anyone considering this toy is there are many more worthwhile toys on the market- skip this one
0	this stroller is way to heavy , too long , steering is very difficult and too bulky , it is huge when folded . try something else .
0	our daughter loves the mobile , she laughs every time the peek-a-boo leaves open to reveal the animals . unfortunately both mobiles that we have bought have failed , none of the music buttons will work except the forest sounds . the sound is also very soft
1	i love this simply designed , sturdy potty . my son loves it which is most important . he has no trouble sitting down on it ; no pinching , no crampedness , no tipping over . the well sized arm rests help him up down the splash gaurd is high enough to prevent him peeing all over ! having only 2 pieces no crevices or anywhere for stuff to get trapped it is so incredibly easy to clean . the first few days we had it my son thought it was so comfy that he would bring into the living room to sit on read books ! great product , great price . i am now planning on getting another one to leave at my mother 's .
0	i bought the bottles and when i used them all the milk came out and get all the baby we
0	these bottles leak after a few months and it 's hard to find new parts for the botttom of the bottle . you almost have to buy more bottles to get new parts when they leak .
0	the only good thing i can really say about this seat is that it comes in pink . it 's hard to find carseats that are not really ugly . otherwise i can not take my newborn out without help because this seat does not recline far enough back and her head flops forward . i will be returning to work in a couple of weeks and will be bringing her with me ( i 'm a nanny ) i do n't know how we are going to do it and may have to purchase a new seat already . i would think that if something is deemed an `` infant '' ' carseat it should work correctly and safely from birth not from when the baby can hold their head up
0	this potty is completely useless . it is so small that my three years olds ' knees are up by his shoulders when he sits on it . it is unstable on those little plastic legs and it 's opening is too small for their little bottoms and it hurts them to sit on it . this potty only stands about four inches off the ground so unless your toddler is the size of a six month old this thing is useless
0	first , i agree with other reviewers who say that this helps their baby 's sleep better . that i can not deny . our two+ week old little girl seems to love it and seems to sleep for longer stretches on it without waking . however , the trade off in better sleep is not worth the risk . i woke up last night to find that she had slipped down and her face was right between the bolsters . she could have easily suffocated ! this is a very common complaint with this product ( both here on amazon 's web site as well as on target 's web site where there are many parents who have reporting having the same scary moment that i had ) . some reviews seem say that if you have a real squirmy older baby that that is the true problem with this product . i have to tell you that that is not quite the case . our little two week old is tightly swaddled at night and does n't move a whole lot - yet she slipped down to a position where she could have suffocated . the bolsters were very tight to her sides and so that does n't explain things either . if you choose to purchase this product , please be very careful with it . i understand that those of you who have infant with reflux do n't really have a choice about this but i recommend that you try it first in the daytime with your infant closely supervised so you can see if they are likely to slip down . as for us , we may try to keep using it by elevating the bottom a little with a blanket underneath but we are absolutely getting rid of the bolsters .
0	my experience has been similar to that of other reviewers . the one movable positioner secures very loosely with a small piece of velcro . my two week old daughter managed to slide down in between the positioners and had her face against one of them when i checked her in the middle of the night . honestly , the only way a baby would stay on this thing is if they did n't move their arms ... so perhaps the designers had no children of their own
1	i bought this pump about 6 weeks after my son was born and i love it . he 's 5 months old now and i have used it while working since he was 3 months old without any problems . i have to pump in the ladies room where i work , but this pump is so quiet that no one knows what i 'm doing . i work 10 hour shifts , so i pump quite a bit , but this pump is so easy to use that i do n't have the hand/wrist pain that i 've had with other manual pumps . overall , the bag is stylish and discreet , the bottles are fabulous ( no nipple confusion problems ) and i have not had any problems with any part of it . the only thing i would suggest to someone looking to purchase one of these is to acquire additional ice packs if you ca n't keep your milk in the fridge . i had to buy two more solid ice packs to keep my milk cold all day . otherwise , i have no complaints . excellent product and service
0	this item is too small . i kept putting it on the back windshield but it kept falling down each time . i could not see my baby in this tiny mirror . not worth the money at all
0	this product is not a safe product and should not be used with your child . not only does it give additional padding that was not intended , nor tested with your safety seat , but it also voids the warranty of the safety seat . nhtsa ( national highway traffic safety administration ) is the government agency that sets standards for child safety seats and states that `` after-market products '' should not be used . it also does not meet fmvss213 standards as stated in the manufacturer 's description
0	this would be a great space-saver . . . but now that gerber has started using the plastic tubs instead of the jars , we never used it at all ! ! now gerber makes their own feeding center to accommodate their tubs , and i love it
0	we are `` training '' and really were looking for a useful aid . it did n't work for us , allowing the entire car seat and straps to become saturated . we will continue to use it with our younger child , in hopes of avoiding a diaper `` leak through '' accident .
0	i was really disappointed in this `` sealy ultra '' . it does not feel like a very good mattress . we 'll use this for a couple months and replace it with something better . i 'd say you need to see the mattress , decide the one you want and then look for the best price on the internet
1	it is hard when you have an infant to secure them in their car seat with a huge snowsuit on . i found myself dredding going out because my daughter would look like an eskimo in her car seat . i was delighted when i found the urban me bundle . i do n't have to worry about bundling her up in heavy gear when we go out . we just put on her hat and go . the urban me bundle gives your child enough breathing room as well as providing warmth and comfort . it helps too that it is rain resistant . i have received many compliments on my urban me bundle and found it to be a wise investment . it really does n't compare to the other ones that are on the market because you can definitely see the difference in quality of the fabric inside and out
1	we have a small home and decided to opt for this type of high chair instead of a stand alone . we just love it and so does our 6 month old
0	i was very disappointed with this pump . it was very loud and stopped working after 3 weeks , and i only used it once a day . even more disappointing was the companys return policy . you have to ship it to them at your expense , wait for them to send you a new one , and return that one to the store . do not waste your time
0	this is the worst pump you could buy . i have gone through 3 of them because the motor breaks down . it also has put me behind in what my daughter is drinking while i am at work . please do n't waste your money ... ... . i also spoke with hospitals and they mentioned that they have many many complaints about this product . if you do n't believe the bad reviews call the hospital and they will tell you the same thing . i recently got a new pump from a friend and found that the evenflow is by far the loudest pump on the planet -- there is no descreet pumping for you if you own this product
1	i 'm not sure what the other reviewer was talking about -- the product installs on the bowl and secures the lid and toilet seat . it 's easy to install and works great
0	i bought this item in preparation for my first child . i tried it 8 times on me and my husband and got a different reading each time , from 94.2 - 102.3 ! ! i returned it the next day , do n't bother !
0	this seat does not fit in any snap and go stroller and is not exceptionally light . if i were to do this over , i would buy a different infant seat
0	the screws that come with the brackets are so soft they strip almost immediately -- - was about to use my own , then read the review below and decided i 'd be better off just screwing the furniture into the wall . .
1	my son loved this ! i purchased this item because i was not comfortable with the idea of hanging something from a door frame . i was nervous that the one that hangs from a door might somehow come down . i felt that my baby was very safe in this and i could put it anywhere in the house that i was . once he was walking , he did n't use it again
1	when it comes to using this for your children you 'd have to first know what your needs are . i ca n't imagine it stopping any determined child without some reinforcing ; it would be more like a psychological barrier . but depending on their temperament and age it may be good to deter them from getting to things they should n't have . i ordered this to use for my puppy . in my case i do n't have the problem of her pushing on it so i ca n't say how long it would last through that . for this price i was quite happy with the quality and it was amazingly simply to install .
1	first , i must say that this sling was an absolute lifesaver when my ( somewhat colicky ) son was a newborn . no matter how fretful his mewling , when we swaddled him and placed him in this sling , he would fall asleep . because he otherwise rarely slept in those early weeks , he spent a good deal of time in it . three aspects of the design are great : 1 . the bottom is padded so you can lay baby on a hard surface and use sling as a changing pad ; 2 . the sides are high and have drawstrings that allow the sling to be opened up almost flat ; 3 . it grows with your baby -- my tiny baby hated the front-type bjorn carriers , but loved this and still likes it . one aspect of the design is , to me , dreadful -- the shoulder strap ! it should be wider and padded . i tried repositioning it every which way and no matter what i did , the strap dug into my shoulder . in the end i just put a thick mitten under the strap on my shoulder . good use for a mitten that 's lost it 's mate , but i would rather have a better strap
1	what a great product . it really keeps the baby warm even in the coldest winter . when the wind is whipping , the generous front flap flips up over the carrying arm of the baby seat and also keeps the baby warm . no fussy coats and hundreds of blankets . i hope to use it next winter also
1	we loved the mini co sleeper ! our son used it until he was around 4 months and his trasition into his crib was so easy . i loved having him right next to me without the worry of rolling on him or waking him up in our bed . i could check on him just by looking at him or putting my hand on him and i didnt even have to roll out of bed . the mini co sleeper was so portable that i never even bought a pack n play . we traveled a lot the first few months with our son and it was so easy to take his bed with us . i highly reccomend the mini co sleeper and the leg extensions were great since our bed was a little high . i will use this for our next baby as well
1	[ ... ] it def . is ... very sturdy , does n't move around once you strap it on to the chair and it looks good too : ) i 'm very happy with this chair - the contoured seat back really hugs the baby yet doesnt constrict his arms ... i love the size of the tray and the size of the cupholders . i find it very easy to hand wash as the bottom only needs a good rinse ... my son has n't gotten food under there yet ... i ca n't wait to use it as a booster seat :
0	i installed this mirror in our car two days ago . today it was in my daughter 's lap when i went to get her out of the car . the mirror broke off from the base . i bought it because it seemed safer than the other types of mirrors ( suction cup attachment , etc ) . i would not recommend this product
1	i just bought these and my daughter looks adorable . the first time i put them on she got a little fussy until she realized she could see through them . the shades come with two straps , one small and one large . my daughter is four months old and the smaller strap barely fits but the larger one is still a little big . the velcro on either side of the smaller strap is just barely attached and fits comfortably only if around the bottom of her head . in this position , her ears are a little pushed down but as the strap is soft it 's not a big deal . if straight around her head , the shades are too tight and squish the area around her eyes . even if adjusted as small as possible , the large strap is still a little too big . it should fit in another month i think .
1	i have this exact same soft light green deluxe pillow . i bought the pillow when she was about 2 weeks old . and i have been wearing it almost all day long every day since . she is 11 weeks old today . she is so comfortable when nursing on this pillow . the cushion is made of firm foam . she falls asleep on the pillow while it is around my waist . even when she 's not nursing or napping , the pillow helps me to support her weight when i 'm sitting or standing . it fits me very comfortably even though i 'm plus size . the only drawback is that i need to order an additional slipcover because it can only be hung to dry , although it is machine washable . i really love this fabric , but apparently , this fabric is not available to purchase separately as a slipcover , so i guess i 'll try the oatmeal twill cover .
1	i bought this chair second-hand for my six month old son , and he loves it ( whereas he hated the hard wooden restaurant high chairs ) . it 's a great size , easy to use , good color for hiding stains , and comfortable for him to sit in . best of all , because it folds up so easily and comes with a carry bag , we can be sure that he does n't get exposed to the germs of every other little kid who frequents the restaurants where we eat ! this is an excellent product , and well worth the money
0	this accessory system does not fit my kohlcraft umbrella stroller . i can find a place to put the parent cupholder , but there is no place at all to put the child 's snack tray . the stroller will not close when it is attached anywhere on the stroller . the whole purpose of spending the money on this `` system '' ( which was considerably more expensive than others in the store ) was for my child to have a snack tray . therefore , it 's going back to the store . there are plenty of other cup accessories out there that are far cheaper than this ... even the prince lionheart cupholder alone was very expensive ... the product itself is also very cheaply made . the `` s '' hooks look so flimsy i would n't trust them ... again , they sell thicker , sturdier `` s '' hooks that look like they will work much better than this , so that 's what i 'll purchase . plus , the parent cupholder is also extremely flimsy ... already the `` arms '' have fallen off several times and that was just moving it from the table to the kitchen counter ! thirdly , i 'm not sure if it was the `` clips '' that came in my packet ( perhaps a defect ) or if they are all made this way ... but it is extremely difficult to get the screws into the clips ... and then they did n't fasten correctly . no matter how i tried ( i worked on it for close to an hour and i consider myself pretty good at these things ! ) , i could not get the clips to tighten properly . they continued to be loose ... even with using the smaller screws . perhaps my stroller tubing is `` too small '' ? ? ? very unlikely , but it just might be the case . this is going back to the store , where i will purchase the insulated parent cupholder for $ 5 , a package of two ( thick ) `` s '' hooks for $ 3 and my child will have to learn to `` deal '' with holding her snack cup and straw cup . i will save myself $ 10 , a headache and backache from attempting to continue to get this on correctly , and my child will get the added bonus of learning to be responsible for her own items ! ! ! do yourself a favor and do n't bother with this product ! ! !
1	i 'm really pleased with this crib . the price was right and it arrived within a matter of days . shipping and handling costs were very low . a few dings here and there and the directions were a little hard to follow . otherwise , it looks great and is very sturdy . great crib for the price
1	i got this for my baby due in march . even though i live in new england area i knew the original bundle me would be too heavy . its perfect wieght for the 50-75 degree weather . it stays on the infant carseat at all times and that way my husband will never forget to have a blanket for the baby . it washes well too ! if you do get a day here and there when its a lot warmer and you do n't need it then the top part zips off and you do n't have to take baby out and remove the entire product . then the next chilly day zip the top back on ! great all around
1	that 's just it- i love this product , and i am so happy that we purchased it . it saves time and space , and is very safe for my children . we bought 2 , one for each of my children- and they have been wonderful
1	i love this product . i have 5 month old twins that were born 6 weeks early . i swaddled them in receiving blankets when they came home from the nicu and they loved sleeping that way . i stopped swaddling them at 2 months because i could see they no longer liked it . my night nurse told me to continue to swaddle them at night for up to a year . she said it would help them sleep through the night . i bought this product and while my girl and boy twins did n't like it at first they do go to sleep faster and stay asleep longer when they are wearing them . not long after i started using this product my son slept from 7 to 7 . what a dream ! he is getting better at getting at least one arm out but even when he does he still sleeps better then when he is not swaddled at all . i have found that it works better when i put them in it when they are drowsy because then they do n't lay in their crib trying to get out of it before they fall asleep . we do n't use them during the day now . i will always give this as a baby gift going forward
1	this monitor has the best sound quality you can put the radio on the monitor and listen on the recever , it will sound like the radio is next to you . i had the monitor for 2 year with out problems with range or interferance . my monitor is been on and in the same channel all that time . i try three other monitors one of them digital . the sony sound quality is untouchable . very sensitive , i can hear my baby move at night . i had no problems with range ( i work out on the basement during her nap ) . it has the best volume ( i can hear her over a loud treadmill and music ) . i was happy to return the other monitors to get this one . the one problen i found is the monitor and the recever can not be close to each other because it will make a horrible loud noise . to avoid this i turn off the monitor before getting close to the room the baby is sleeping in . the water resistant feature is great , i can put the recever right in the shower and listen or watch the lights . it is not waterproof ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! you do n't want to get it wet ! ! ! ! ! ! , but the humidity or a little splashing wo n't hurt it
1	this is the best bed rail if you do not have a box spring . my 2 year old recently moved into his toddler bed and i purchased this rail because he has a `` bunkie '' board instead of a box spring . the length is satisfactory , and the fold-down mechanism is perfect because of the raised hinges . it is easy to make the bed as well . we also purchased it for the grandparent 's house because they have a platform bed . it works equally as well . my only complaint is that maybe the rail is n't high enough but my son has n't been tempted to climb over it . i would recommend this bed rail for a good transition to a `` big boy '' bed that does n't have a box spring ( although the manufacturer recommends it )
1	i purchased this despite the reviews i read , out of desperation ! but have been very happy with the fit on my eddie bauer morgan gingham playard bassinet . it is a little thin , however , i use a carter 's mattress pad underneath anyway , so i am not concerned with absorbancy . it does the job as a nice surface to lay my son 's head on , and i purchased one more in navy to switch out when it is laundry time
1	the strap on mine broke and i was very quickly sent a replacement . i expressed my concerns about the size of the belt ( i have a small frame and it is big on me ) and i was told a newer design was in the works and they would send it to me once it 's done . very friendly , amazing customer service , that 's hard to find these days !
1	i am quite satisfied with this product overall . sometimes it is too sensative and gets electrical interferrence . during armer weaather when the window was opened i also picked up air traffic but over all it is a very good product
0	i bought this product as i was going on a long trip . i put the batteries in the mirror and it did not work . i put the batteries in the remote and it still did not work . all that would happen is that the little red light would flash and you could n't even turn it off without taking out the batteries . waste of money !
1	excellent product ... very difficult to find in stores . can safely heat breastmilk and formula in a warmer ... healthier than heating in plastic
0	i took this on a short trip , it proved useless . it 's unstable , has a sharp edge which cuts into the baby 's bottom -- i ca n't understand how anyone would be expected to sit on this ... especially a potty-training child ? my daughter was fairly young when we tried it ( we did some early pt , and she was about 10 months old ) . she 's now 2 , fully pt , but will still not go near it . if it was so flimpsy for a 10 months old , how would it do under the weight of an older child ? beyond me . i still give it 2 stars , because it 's an otherwise neat idea . impractical execution , though
0	we own two of these and they have never been easy to use . we tore holes in the first one trying to insert the seat . we have kept it though . we bought another and on our second trip the zippers broke off . we would not buy this one again . we do have large carseats - they are both britax marathons
0	i have small hands , so i actually ca n't grip this product with one hand . it slips right out , because there is no hole . the items are okay , really do n't like the nail cutters though , and they do n't stay in there places . i 'm sure there are better kits out there
0	the aspirator has no suction power and only irritated my son . the nail clippers are not sharp enough to cut a newborns soft nails . i use my own revlon clipper especially since i am comfortable with the feel of it already . the thermometer is sooo ... slow , i get make an educated guess faster . the case is cute and i am sure the medicine droppers are ok ... have n't needed those yet . but all in all , i threw half of this kit in the garbage
0	( 2 stars because the style is cool ... ) this was a christmas gift from my husband this year as our son is a big boy ( 19 1/2 lbs @ 4 months ) and it was too much to carry him , his carrier and a heavy diaper bag everyday to daycare so this seemed like the perfect solution ... and it was ... until the bag started coming apart 7 days after i received it ! and i was careful , i had read some of the other reviews about the stitches coming apart and i had thought they had just over filled the bag ... nope ! the bottle holder has ripped all the way down the side ... you ca n't overfill that ... there 's just room for one bottle , is n't that what it is made for ? ? ? my husband really loved this bag because it was n't 'girly or babyish ' but put the $ $ on something that will hold a bottle !
0	tried this and the zippering was poorly constructed . ihave a product from nano bags that beats this one in construction and comfort . this was nice only received as a gift but nothing more . washed poorly , disappointed
1	this potty is simple and very easy to clean with only two pieces . it is also more stable than others we used . we like it
1	i purchased these for my pack n ' play , and they are soft and durable . a real must-have for pack-n-play owners
0	i bought this pump the day i was discharged from the hospital ( 12/11/05 ) . i have used it on a part time basis since i am staying home and nurse directly . however , the motor broke and could n't pump anymore . my baby is only 5 months and this pump already broke . i have only used it during nights to keep a storage for my baby . i was lucky to call medela on time since this pump is still under its 6 month warranty period so i could get my money back .
0	i purchased this seat because of the safety factor that consumer reports reported on . in comparing the seat to graco snugride , however , i am very disappointed on the tough , very dense foam on the low back/sacral region of the seat . the foam goes down to a certain point on baby 's low back , and then disappears , leaving a dip for baby 's buttocks . just imagine sitting in a recliner with support only down to the low-back region ( with buttocks not supported ) ... not comfortable . i wonder how a baby 's backside would stand up to a traumatic jolt in that seat ... well , i 'm not going to take any chances . baby trend should have consulted a physical therapist ( like me ) before designing this seat .
1	i picked this monitor after reading many reviews . the reviews did n't lie . this monitor does great on distance . i have a 2400 sq ft home that has 3 floors . the bedrooms are on the 3rd floor and most of my housework ended up on the 2nd floor . i can have this on while vacuuming and still hear my son cry or even move around when he would wake up and not make a sound . i could hear him grunt even ! i do n't know why the one review mentions a 15ft signal loss . you 're given many channels in order to find the right strength . i could go outside of my home and walk approximately 10 ft away from the garage door and still have signal ( he was on opposite end of house upstairs ) . i also took the receiver in the shower a couple of times , not getting it soaked . also like the voice activated portion but that only works if the room or surrounding area has no sound ( no radio or tv or mobile playing ) . great product , strongly recommend . my son is now 5 months old and the monitor still works great . this monitor is the right choice for the average household . interference may come if you 're on the same channel . i have wifi network , cordless digital phones and nextels and do not have any interference with this monitor so others just do n't know how to resolve thier issue before blaming the product
0	i bought this sling when my son was 8 months old and 19 pounds . he hated this carrier because he could n't turn around and see the world . i hated this carrier because the rigid straps cut into my hips and shoulder every time he tried to move . the seller recommended making sure the straps were place correctly ( i tried numerous positions . there is n't a place on your body where unforgiving straps are particularly comfortable ) and also said to tighten the straps so the baby could n't move around . i did all of these things and still found it very uncomfortable to wear . the seller was helpful and the product arrived promptly , so i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 . there is a $ 5 return charge .
0	this lock works good for a little while , then the push mechanism breaks . it may or may not break completely off , so it could still work even when it breaks . i 've gone through two of these already , and they only lasted a few months before they broke
1	i am sure this is a good stroller ( that 's why i bought it ! ) my `` review '' is more of a word of caution : this thing takes forever to arrive . do n't be fooled : `` usually ships within 24 hours '' really means `` may ship sometime '' . as of 2/8/06 , our stroller has not arrived . it was ordered january 1 , 2006 . it is not even slated to ship for another week ( we 'll see ... ) . meanwhile , the local store has several in stock . my advice for anyone trying to time this as a gift or for a trip or other occasion : go to your local store . otherwise , be prepared to wait a very long time .
1	i did my research for the best stroller , thus this one is the best in market , travelling with my baby is much fun and easier . i can carry , fold and move it with no help , its so easy to open and fold . its very cozy , my baby can sleep happily in it
0	the nail clippers , hairbrush , and comb are great but i did not care for the rest . it would be cost effective to buy the items seperately from this company
1	my 4.5 month old son has never liked the plastic bathing tubs , so right from the very beginning , he 's been in the big tub with a tub seat . he loved bath time until just a few weeks ago , when he outgrew our original especially for baby ( the bru `` house '' brand ) tub seat . in desperation , we searched the shelves at bru and settled on the mother 's touch . i ca n't say enough good things about this tub seat . the head support features a soft washcloth-like insert to cushion a newborn 's delicate head , and it can be repositioned or removed as the baby grows . the two-position back reclines for newborns , and sits up straighter for older babies . the entire seat is up high enough that quite a bit of water is needed in the tub , but i found that it makes it easier to control how deep my baby sits in the water ( in the old tub seat , he had to be up to his ears in order to have enough water to bathe in ) . one of the things my son hated about his previous tub seat was that he could n't sit up in it . the design of the mother 's touch provides enough support to allow baby to sit up mostly unassisted , and the ample padding makes sure he does n't bruise himself on the hard edges . even though there 's lots of support and padding , it 's still very important to closely supervise your baby when using this ( or any ) tub seat . another reviewer mentioned a couple of things things that i 'd like to respond to : *there are no suction cups on the base : i have found that the rubber grips provide more than enough traction , but tubs may vary . *she would like a strap : the seat that i have does have a strap ( it 's stored underneath the seat , so may not be immediately identifiable ) , so i wonder if the seat has been redesigned recently . overall , my son and i are very happy with this tub seat , and i 've been recommending it to friends . they 'll have to buy it new instead of getting it as a hand-me-down , though . i foresee him being able to use it for most of his first year before he outgrows it !
1	we are in italy with these huge , weird shaped stairways . these gates are great and just what we were looking for . easy to install , easy to use once up . they look nice in our house
1	we bought this stroller today in honolulu at the bike factory . our son is 18 months old , 48 pounds and 40 inches tall ( yes , we know we got a linebacker on our hands ) so we had to find something that might last him for the next year or so . we love that the max weight is 70 pounds , but wonder if the harness system will grow with him being that we have already let out all the slack that is there , i think ? ? ! ! . i am going to read the instructions again to see if i might have missed something . but other than that , the stroller is very sturdy , well-made , and light weight . it handles like a dream and i would n't be afraid to take it to the mall shopping because it is not any wider or more cumbersome than our old graco . it folds up to a nice tiny package and fits perfectly in the back our explorer , where the graco did not . i ca n't wait to take it running down along the beach in the morning . oh , and our son loves it too by the way ... he watched elmo in the living room and would n't get out until we bribed him with a bath , so it must be pretty comfortable . definitely worth every dime , we love it . i ca n't say enough good things about bob either , they are very helpful and their website is pretty informative too , [ ...
0	i agree with rebecca -- bravados are more simple , more flexible , and more comfortable
0	i had been told that these were wonderful , to keep your baby safe while sleeping on his side or back . but my little man slides down to where his face is between the foam sides . this worries me more than if he were to sleep on his stomach
0	seemed like a good idea but these days it hardly fits over any of the grocery carts or high chairs at restaurants . so now it sits in my car fading in the sun . save your money
0	this idea is nice but , the tray is hard to fit up to your child its tight or too loose were food is in there lap . next the tray is hard to get off and wash. next mine came with a tray to cover or use as a tray , and that is really hard to get off , by the time i got it off i was ready toss it in the trash . unless you are super woman i would not bu
0	i registered for the entire locomotion collection before my son was born and have been very happy with it . i love the theme , but the mobile was a big disappointment . it did n't fit the crib properly and although my husband tried to figure out a way to install it without any type of conversion kit available , he just could n't attach it safely and we ended up returning it . also , although the mobile matches the theme , i found that the colors were n't very stimulating . we bought the tiny love symphony in motion mobile instead and although the colors did n't match , our son got many months of enjoyment and stimulation out of it .
1	the medela breast pump works with dr. brown 's bottles ( you can pump directly into the bottle ) ! just an added benefit to an already great product . i 've been using mine almost daily for 11 months and have had no problems . it 's worth the money if you plan on breastfeeding/pumping for more than a couple of months
0	we got this in lieu of another similar one because it was in stock , but lo and behold it only lasted a week . our son lays on his back and kicks everything in his crib , so when he kicked this , the knob securing it to the crib through the strap broke off . luckily the broken piece fell on the floor and not into his crib , where it could have posed a choking hazard ! pass on this and get a fisher price one - ocean wonders or the one we got , flutterbye dreams , which he loves
0	this product pulls nothing out of the noses of my one year old twins . we had hoped that it would be easier than manual aspirators but it has proven totally useless . unless your child 's nose is leaking like a faucet save your money and get the rubber aspirators .
0	we had to clean this high chair nearly every day and the process itself would take 30 minutes . i am not a neat freek in any way shape or form . but you kind of have to clean this frequently as the food goes into every nook and cranny . if i had to buy another chair i would get a wood one . we have the eddie bauer booster now that our son is older . we clean that once a day with a sponge which takes all of 1 minute and take the cushion off for a super clean once a week . the prima pappa is comfortable and secure . in the end i realized that we did n't need all the bells and whistles
0	loved the car seat , until my daughter was able to reach down and lift the velcro strap and release the harness portion of the straps . i would hope that the manufacturer would address this and move the harness tightening straps under the seat . that is my only complaint and it has indeed been a great car seat .
0	i ordered this through walmart.com and received it damaged , but walmart and/or storkcraft use a distributor called seko worldwide . the seko delivery truck delivered the crib . so either this is a storkcraft problem or a seko problem , but the head board had a piece completely split off in two and the other pieces were dented or chipped off . walmart is re-odering another crib and having this one picked up for me as it is an 80-pound box . hopefully the next crib wo n't be damaged , but if so , i am giving up on storkcraft completely . walmart did n't have a rating system to leave comments , and when i saw others on this website that had damage problems , i wanted to relay my experience as well . walmart graciously refunded my shipping fee , which was large . i then received the second crib and it was spotless . the delivery man from seko worldwide said that they hear complaints on this a lot and blamed the air carrier that flies the boxes out to the ground shipping location . i also emailed storkcraft about what happen and the other negative reviews , they offered to send a replacement piece for the broken piece ( but no mention about the dented/chipped piece ) and then proceeded to place the blame on the retailer . i was not impressed . i was willing to take my chances on the reorder and was one of the fortunate customers who recieved an unmarked crib . i put it together myself , all the parts were accounted for and the drawer works great . i only bought this for the price and the convertable feature but will not buy storkcraft in the future .
0	my daughter is only two months old and she slides off this thing all the time . i even tried to put a towell to make it less steep , but it did n't work . worst yet , her head would slide off the edge . i guess it will work for baby who is small and less than one month old and does not move around
1	good things : ( 1 ) no interference . we live in a residential neighborhood in the suburbs . ( 2 ) connects with no problem two stories down with the baby on 2nd floor and the monitor in the basement . i 've even used it out in the yard without any loss of connection problems . ( 3 ) you can hear pretty much everything happening in the nursery . only one bad thing -- the belt clips on the parent units are practically useless . they are not large enough to stay on a belt oe waistband with any normal amount of movement and the lip at the end of the clip digs into your side if you have the unit on your waistband
1	my baby had very bad reflux and pediatrician told us not to move her to her room , my fear was that she would get use to sleep in our bedroom and moving her became a nightmare . when reflux got better at month 4 we finally got to move her and for us this monitor became a very useful tool , it has rechargeable batteries , image and sound are clear enough , night vision works perfect , monitor is not bulky at all ( no color at all though ) , and we managed to tie camera to the crib 's headboard and worked great for us .
1	this monitor is pretty good . it pick up my little one 's little noises so i can get to her before she awakens . it does have a clicking sound with it if the reception in less then 4 bars ( which it is less then 4 bars most of the time as my house is long ) . i do have high praise for the fisher price exchange service . i had bought a monitor before my little one was born and so therefor did n't use it until after the 30 day return allowance from amazon was up . then after about 6 hours of use the monitor stopped working . i was able to send it to fisher-price and they exchanged it in less then ten days ! ( no questions asked
1	i bought this for my second son who is a year old . i love it . it 's compact and fits easily in the diaper bag . after he eats , i take it to the restroom and it rinses right off . i 've started using it at home too because the little tray in the front catches food really well ( and saves my floors ! ) . i recommend anyone who hates to see their child rub their food all over the germy table buy this ! !
0	i bought this chair used and i do n't think it 's worth the $ 50 i paid for it . i also have the fisher price chair ( i have twins ) and that one is so much better - i wish i had 2 of those . first , like everyone has said , it is ridiculous to clean . those people who said it 's easy to clean must either not be really cleaning it or have babies that make very little mess . gross food particles collect in every crease and corner , especially under the seat . most importantly , the tray is way too high - even at 1 yrs old my girls are uncomfortable reaching food on it and they are an average height/weight . the tray also does n't come close enough so there is a big gap between the baby and the chair - not dangerous but perfect for all the food to fall through and collect in the sides of the chair and on the lap . finally , the tray is too big for an average size dishwasher so must always be washed by hand . the fp high chair tray can go right into the dishwasher . only buy this chair if the only thing you care about is how it looks
1	i love these little books ... they play music.. good for before bed , my girls can chew on them ( which makes both me and my two year old son happy ) ... just fantastic ... great buy
1	a great success . i love all kiddapotamus products , that i bought so far because they are well-done , thoughtful and win awards all the time - but best of all , they are really very handy . we went to a restaurant and for the first time we could put our sons food right on the placemat on the table so that he could feed himself . without that mat , we had to hold onto the food or but a napkin underneath - so one of us was always busy with our son instead of enjoying a dinner out . the placemat comes with a scoop that holds most of the food that our son will drop from his mat and the floor was still clean after we left . best of all with this mat we can provide a germfree space for him to sit , eat and play - on our table . he was really happy about it . after our visit we rolled this wonderful placemat together and put it in my handbag . i was really satisfied
0	the ideas for the bottles interchanging is great . but unfortunately the nipples cause too much gas . when they 're using the bottle , you can hear constant air sucking in around their lips . every time my little girl uses them , it seems as though she just ca n't get comfortable with them . i would recommend dr.brown 's or playtex ventaire bottles over any of these . ultimately , the convenience and features are n't worth the massive amount of gas the avent bottles cause
1	i used one of these 24 inch extensions to cover a 90 inch space . the kidco configure gate contains three 24 inch pieces ( i.e . 72 inches total ) , so if you need extra length , you can purchase 8 or 24 inch extensions to customize your gate to any length . the extension was easy to use and is very sturdy . the gate looks uniformed and you can not tell it is several separate pieces . the only 'issue ' is you have to connect the extensions to either the section w/the door ( i.e . 24 inch section with the open/close swing door ) or use it as an end piece . i was not able to continously connect extensions to one another ( not sure if i did this incorrectly or not . ) but nonetheless , the extension worked fine and i love my new gate
0	i registered for this sling , and was thrilled when i received it as a shower gift . i could n't wait to use it . when my son was about 3 weeks old , i tried to put him in it . we both instantly hated it . its far too bulky to use with an infant , and it does n't adjust small enough to fit my frame ( i 'm 5'6 '' and far from skinny ) . i kept it , thinking that my son would eventually fit in it , and perhaps as he got bigger i 'd be able to wear it . wrong . i wish i 'd brought it back when i could still return it . my son is now 11 months old and we still ca n't use this sling . there 's no way he can sit in it securely . he hates being held but ca n't walk yet so i was really hoping we could use this , but it still does n't fit me , and my 24 pound son is n't held safely in it . he can wiggle his way out in less than 3 seconds . i 'm expecting again , and hoping i can find something much better than this for this baby
1	i like this product very much . it is very soft , unlike the other tubs where i was scared that my son would hit his head . the only drawback i have about is the belt ... .maybe in the next one they can come up with a good belt that would hold the infant . other than that i would recommend it to anyone . it looks very comfortable too . especially if you have taller babies this is the best bathing system
1	i breast fed my son for a year in 2003 with the medela pump back then . i trusted medela to pick up this one for my daughter this year . i pump once a day , so they get used , but not abused . the model has changed some , i think it is more powerful this time . the thing i do n't like , but certainly can live with , is the motor not being attached to the breast shield . my chest is rather large , so putting the bottles in the unit and holding the unit to my chest with one hand is not an option . i have to hold each shield upto my chest and the motor sits in my lap . i ca n't control the speed or turn the unit on/off because i do n't have a free hand . i leave the speed where i need it before and take the bottle off while it 's still on and put it in the bottle holder while i turn the unit off . i still very much like this product as it gets the job done
1	we received the original co-sleeper as a gift . we also considered getting a mini co-sleeper and a pack'n'play or similar playard . the main advantage of the co-sleeper is that you can attach it to your bed so you can reach your baby without getting up . the original co-sleeper can also be used as a playard . the playard capacity is up to 50 pounds , most brands are only rated to 30 lb . similarly the bassinet level rating is 30 lb . and most brands go to 15 . the co-sleeper itself is about 2 or 3 pounds heavier than a typical playard . the width is 28 '' so the co-sleeper can go through our 29 '' doorways without collapsing , unlike several playards that are around 31 '' . there is a trick to collapsing the top bars - you have to pull the bar upwards when you press the buttons , then it 's easy . ( otherwise you can push until your thumbs are purple and nothing happens ) this is explained on their website and should have been included in the manual . i had a lot of reservations after reading other reviews here but am glad i chose to keep the co-sleeper and expect it to use it constantly . also , the arm 's reach canopy is really strong and beautiful and i 'm confident it 'll keep the cats out
0	sometimes you just have to spend the money to get the superior product . buy from pottery barn and order additional covers from them as well . same pillow but the fleece-like cover exclusively at pottery barn is actual `` luxury . '' more comfortable for mom and baby . wears amazingly well due to thickness and stains lift right out . we have used one cover continuously for over 4 months and it 's still like new . in another class from the `` chintzie '' alternatives offered at other stores
1	i have a climber ! she could climb out of her crib at age 13 months . she was way too young for a bed . we also have the crib tent ii and both items have allowed us to feel our now 22 month old daughter is safely in her crib at night -- not roaming her room or house while we sleep . it was either these products or emptying all the furniture out of her room , putting a mattress on the floor , and putting a lock on her door at night to keep her safe . life saver
1	i bought this backpack after reading several of the other reviews and i am glad i did ! i did some shopping around at local stores and all of the other backpacks i found were either much more expensive or were the same price but had fewer features . my 7 month old daughter loves this backpack . in addition , we do n't need the diaper bag because it has so many pockets . i did not have any trouble putting on the sun visor and the backpack is very easy to store and use . i originally bought this backpack to take abroad in place of a stroller but i can see that it is going to be handy in places like the zoo and grocery shopping as well . i do n't know how it would do for serious campers , but for every day use it has been great .

0	this machine is not loud enough , i have 2 machines this one that is in the babies room and a different machine ( made by lifewise ) in my boys room ... .my boys sleep through anything , the dog , the door bell ... whatever it is ... but this machine just does n't cut it unless you live in a sound proof house..
1	i have n't traveled with the bag yet , but the quality seems good . the bag has a cloth-like exterior and the interior fabric is a thick vinal . my stroller is a pram style one where the handle bar can reverse and is oversized . the stroller fits in the bag with 2 wheels off from the same side because of the thin long ends of the bag ( the top thin long end is where the zipper is ) . they are removable wheels , so its no problem . with all the wheels on , the bag ca n't zip closed . that is why i gave it only 4 stars . i bought the bag because i will be traveling overseas soon and i do n't want my stroller damaged during the long flight .
0	i bought this thermometer and liked it but after i used it a few times the buttons stopped working and i could n't turn it off . i opened it to remove the battery and found that it had water in it . a bath thermometer should at least be waterproof
0	i bought this stroller for when we had our second child . my children are 19 mo . apart . i had the aria single stroller for my first and loved it . this one is definitely not the same . for one thing , it is very hard to steer and get over bumps . the wheels are always getting stuck . second , it is hard to close . the most frustrating part is the steering issue . also , my aria decal fell off as well many months ago . i 've only had the stroller for nine months . one more thing , the canopy to block out the sun is basically worthless since it offers very little protection from the sun .
1	i liked this positioner because it came with an adjustable head piece . my baby kept wiggling up to the top of the headboard and this piece kept him from doing so . i also liked the fact that as my baby grew wider i could adjust the wedges . one more thing this comes with a mat . this saved me from changing the sheet because he puked up so much . i bought two and would flipp flopp them when he would get sick
1	i bought this pump after the avent isis failed me along with an electric pump . the fact that this pump puts so much control over suction power in my hands is great . im able to empty each breast in 15 min or less sometimes . although its a little loud it is a manual pump and all manual pumps are a little noisy . from reading the other reviews i think that alot of other mothers expected results from this pump that just arent reasonable . remember most manual pumps arent for constant expressing purposes or for bringing in milk supply . if you read tegh package the manufacturer even says that they recommend the pump for emptying breasts occasionally like when spending time away from baby or breastfeeding moms who express once or twice a day so others can feed baby . and they discourage it for working moms who have to pump everyday .
0	my 8 1/2 mo . granddaughter got her leg stuck between the bars in the middle of the night . i 've got the correct bumper pads , etc . but babies do move . she had bruises on her ankle and was throwing up she was so upset . i 've only had the crib 1 week , she 's gotten her leg stuck 2 times . we caught it within minutes and it frightens me to think that she could have gone longer .
1	when we got our changing table from a friend who no longer needed it ... they gave us the diaper depot as well . i love how it puts everything at an arms reach without clutting the changing table . it has lasted two kids before the one it 's on now , so a total of three babies . i guess like anything if it 's taken care of properly it wo n't break
0	i received this sheet and was immediately disappointed . the quality is very cheap and it was n't a perfect fit . i am surprised that this is made by graco - usually their products are good . i would not recommend buying this . i would buy a regular crib sheet instead .
0	do you know how clever alan trachtenberg is ? i mean , do you really , really know ? ! because if not , this book is for you . trachtenberg 's book is only superficially about indians or americans , it is about the obscure conections he can draw between unrelated things -- because he is very clever , you know . in so far as this book has a thesis , that it is it
1	you definetly should read this book ! do n't believe what the 1 star writers are saying . they do n't want you to know the truth ! the left claims that bin laden would never side with saddam because of their beliefs , yet the left is adamant that osama bin laden was funded by the united states . go figure ! we all knew there was a connection and stephen hayes demonstrates so with great care ! there is a connection with al qaeda and iraq and the book explains it in detail
1	i am at the mid-point of the book and will likely post another review when i am done . [ ... ] the authors give the history and motivation and design decisions behind hla . they also give many good examples , [ ... ] , allow you to get a really good feel for the important concepts of hla by running an actual federation . one thing i will be looking for is the impact of the architecture on simulation performance , scalability in practice ( as opposed to in theory ) , and how is hla likely to evolve over the next couple decades . i do n't know yet whether the book is enough for you to create your first federation . if you really have no background at all in simulation , you will still get a lot out of the first couple of chapters , plus the many references to articles written on the subject , but do n't expect to find the other chapters easy . using my background in simulation systems , i can say that hla seems to have been very well thought out , based on real-life simulation systems , and is therefore not trivial . but that 's what makes it interesting , and the book so far lives up to that

0	i'vc had this book since i was 7 years old . i loved the awesome photos of echanis doing his thing . if you like the elaborate and complex , then this is the knife fighting book for you . there are simpler ways of `` getting it done '' , but few are more fun to try . and , by the way , if any of you are curious as to how he died , he was killed while `` training '' in nicaragua . hmmm . .
0	reading through john irving 's `` the cider house rules , '' i found myself continuing to read mostly out of a desire to have the book over and done with and only partly out of a sense of curiosity . in obtaining a bachelor 's degree in english , i had to read a lot of books . among them were many books that i did not like , but never before had i read a book that was so completely devoid of subtlety . every single scene in the book feels as though it was specifically designed and manufactured by the author to move the plot along . people become pregnant , have abortions , and die with such terrible regularity that you can foresee it dozens of pages before it happens . this goes way beyond mere foreshadowing . the book does n't flow naturally , you can virtually see the author hiding in the shadows , playing the puppet master . there are just so many coincidences , so many old friends just happening to run into eachother , so many people becoming pregnant just at the exact time to make the story progress perfectly , all of the characters vaguely , distantly connected to eachother . i do n't want to spoil the plot , but suffice it to say that the plotline involving the eames ( rhymes with screams ) family is just too much coincidence to bear . it 's as though the author is god , and the characters completely lack free will . and then there 's the `` protagonist , '' homer wells . i put protagonist in quotations because despite being the center of the story , homer wells barely does anything in the story . he barely even speaks during the story . he is virtually a non-character , devoid of personality or will , around whom the other characters and events of the book revolve . the scenes that do not involve homer wells at all , and they make up the majority of the book , are without fail the most interesting scenes . i think that the real protagonist of the book is dr. larch , but even melony seems more real than homer does . the story is very long and rambling . subplots are begun and then abandoned and only mentioned in passing much later on . minor characters keep popping into the story , then disappearing , only to pop back into the story exactly when they 're needed . conflicts are either quickly and conveniently resolved or simply ignored and forgotten ( like the situation with debra pettigrew ) . after such a rambling , at times rather boring plot , the ending feels rather rushed . it is as though the author realized that he suddenly had to resolve everything , tie up every loose end , in the last 25 pages ( and tying up loose ends , in this case , means a lot of people conveniently dying ) . to spoil the plot just a little , homer wells , who has throughout the book been opposed to abortion because he feels that a fetus has a soul , suddenly and inexplicably and completely reverses on this opinion . i personally am pro-choice as well , but i found that homer 's sudden reversal was completely contrary to his character and caused the ending of the book to collapse into a bunch of nonsensical happily-ever-afters
1	a few years ago , i had the pleasure of meeting pam munoz ryan at a summer arts children 's storytelling forum held at california state university - fresno . she read the book to parents , teachers , and students who attended the conference . i was amazed on the writing , culture , and illustrations that she used for this book . the novel serves as a tale of her childhood spending time with her family at her grandmother 's house . overall , the story teaches children the value of traditions , family , and heritage . in short , `` mice and beans '' is a good book to read
1	drummer hoff is an unusual story that uses repetitive phrases and rhyming to tell the story of drummer hoff , the man who `` fired it off . '' in this story , a group of men are preparing to fire a cannon . each man brings something different . one man brings the barrel , one man brings the carriage , and at the every end of each stanza it says `` but drummer hoff fired it off . '' this story uses childlike drawings to demonstrate the pattern of rhythm in the story . the colors are fairly bright which in turn give the story a comical appeal . the story itself does n't have any significant moral element to it ... it is just a fun book . the rhyming in this story is very catching and the pictures really make the story very humorous . by the end of the story the reader can see that the big explosion has just caused a big mess . children will like the flow the story and parents will enjoy reading it aloud . a good holiday gift .
0	this entire book reads like an 8th-grade research paper . from an uncountable amount of grammatical and spelling errors to numerous repeated sentences ( literally quotes retyped word for word , pages apart ) , it 's difficult not to get irritated while reading this . the information on weezer is great , but often times the author veers away from focusing on the band and gives too much information on things that even the most obsessed fan wo n't care about . unfortunately , this appears to be the only book on weezer out right now , so if you want to learn more about the band in book form this is all you 've got . i suggest just browsing around their official website , because it 's obvious that 's where the author got quite a bit of his information . do n't waste your money
1	this book is simply incredible . a more stimulating book i could n't imagine ! it 's not that it told me so much i did n't know intuitively , but seeing it written so distinctly in black and white really hit home . this is one to read if you really want to get a sense of just how dramatically the world has changed . neal gabler , tells it like he sees it and has a lot of research to back up his views . i love that he does n't make judgements or try to press an opinion on the reader . it 's left up to you to decide how you feel about it all . i find myself thinking of points he brought up throught the day and seeing just what he meant by experiencing it in `` real '' life . the only reason i did n't give it a 5 is because i wish it was a bit more in-depth . it 's so engaging that i can imagine an entire college course being made from this book . it is a book that 's as entertaining as it is informative , and that 's the whole point
1	i read a review of this in l.a. weekly which said that it was `` a lot of fun '' and entertaining in a sort of ironic way , despite the fact that it became more slapstick at the end . i read it , and agreed for the most part , except i felt that the characters were much stronger and wittier than i had expected and the author seemed more generous to them than i would have thought from the initial satirical tone . the ending was a little over the top , but it was an example of the kind of senseless fireworks these characters would have to simulate in their own lives . all in all , i thought it was a very intelligent and amusing first novel
0	i started reading this immediately after the last reh compilation and there could not be a greater difference in story telling . while reh was first and foremost a story teller , pressfield uses one of the absolute worst devices in his recount of a grandson of his grandfather 's remembering his conversations with a client who knew the famous alcibiades . this , as previous reviewers have mentioned , creates a large gap between reader and story . but why do this ? why use such a crappy method of story telling ? i guess it pads the book with unnecessary dialogue . all in all , it 's a slow , uninspired , day dream story . so crappy that i felt it necessary to write this review echoing previous harsh reviews . i want my money back
0	i might have been expecting too much , but i was disappointed with this book . i did not learn anything on dark magick per se . the first half of the book is about a variety of subjects like , goths , vampires , lost souls , the collective unconscious , dark deities , satanism and some other stuff . the second half is about magick , but it sounds more like high magick to me . where 's the dark magick
0	while i realize that the majority of people thought this to be a stellar book , it reminds me of the story , `` the emperor has no clothes '' . yes , choan can write a beautiful sentence and yes , the first several pages were intriguing but the switching of years was very annoying . the `` flipping back and forth '' was not accomplished in a smooth , flowing manner . in addition , the subject matter was incredibly depressing and the characters were so flawed that one did not even care about how their lives evolved . the kidnapping was predictable and the ending contrived . it would be impossible to recommend this book to anyone
0	there are just too many errors , of interpretation , omission and commission , in this book to justify purchasing it.in this review we will concentrate on rima 's ( r ) handling of the work of j m keynes.on p.84 , r 's claim that the physiocratic concept of hoarding is `` surprisingly suggestive '' of j m keynes 's idea has no supporting evidence to back it up.on p.133 , r claims that malthus had developed a principle of effective demand , a la keynes.what malthus expressed was an uneasy feeling and/or intuition that ricardo 's deductive , analytical system of market self adjustment to a global optimum was overlooking ( or assuming away ) the possibility of insufficient aggregate spending.nowhere does malthus ever systematically present a theoretical counter to ricardo.what malthus does is express some reservations in an exchange of postal letters with ricardo.in chapter 20 of r 's book , she attempts to deal with keynes 's theory of effective demand and keynes 's discussion of involuntary unemployment which follows directly from his theory.keynes worked out the mathematical details in his chapter 20 , titled `` the employment function '' .r should have simply reprinted that chapter in her book , replacing her chapter 20 with keynes 's chapter 20.r 's figure 20.1 , discussed on pages451-454 , directly contradicts keynes 's analysis
0	two huge problems with this book . one , this self righteous club is leaving clues to a killer and `` traveling and learning '' when they already know his identity , so i guess he can keep on dismembering women until the psychiatrist figures it all out and then gets teary eyed over his new special wine glass . two , the city of los angeles functions as a character in kellerman 's other novels and adds alot of realism to the novels . this thing drags on in some unnamed , nondescript city
1	most people will say that episode one is their least favorite of all the star wars films . but john williams composure for this one is second only to the empire strikes back for the entire star wars trilogy . this extended version is a must have , it contains all the music from the movie . the entire fight scene at the end of the movie is included and its wonderful to listen to . i wish somoone would do the rest of the prequel trilogy like this cd . a must have
0	i ordered the book from them on nov1 . on nov 15 i called and they told me they did n't have it . the money was returned by amazon
0	i know all this stuff seems like a good idea but have we forgotten ghb ? that was supposedly the fountain of youth a few years ago and now no one hardly even talks about it . let me let you in on a little secret , ghb turned out to be a very addictive substance and in fact a handy little trick to get a girl naked without any problems like dinner movie or even her knowing you for that matter . like hgh , everyone jumped on it before all the data was in . please put your money away and be safe . a pretty face is n't worth the trouble this could potentially cause . and lets be realistic at 60 you really wo n't ever look 20 again and the weight you would have lost will be the money leaving your pocket book and not the fat from your thighs . work out , do yoga , and eat a healthy vegetarian diet and you ca n't go wrong . also , when i stopped eating sugar the cellulite also disappeared and so did those extra pounds

1	yay -- this book was fun and extremely informative . at first , the idea of coloring at my age was a bit funny ( to keep it humorous for me , i conjured up in my mind a tall , overgrown middle-aged male graduate student squeezed in a chair , hunched back looking over a desk and coloring with his set of 64 crayons ) . anyway , i digress . as a doctoral graduate student taking a neuroscience course -- this book really helped me nail down structures of *way* too many things . but ultimately , it helped me make the grade . if you get the book , make sure to color in it -- it really does help ( not to mention a great way to relieve some stress from the day ) . otherwise , what 's the use of buying a book like this -- it becomes an ordinary textbook if you do n't color in it .
1	craig cockran has reprized his first work with a text that is as rich as it is inspiring . detail oriented , yet captivating and simple to read , this book belongs in the library of anyone who is invested in the qi process or just starting a qi program . the writer has once again shown a unique grasp of business and the instructional process . i look forward to the next installment from this outstanding author
0	the daughter of a prominent boston doctor is dead , apparently from a botched abortion ( which was illegal in the late 60 's ) . dr. john berry 's friend , art lee , is in jail for the crime , which he says he did n't commit . so , dr. berry sets out to prove his friend 's innocence , and runs into cover-ups and lots of secrets . but there are many doubts , such as was the girl really pregnant , and did dr. lee actually perform the surgery , and why is dr. berry so interested in finding the culprit ? for michael crichton 's first novel , it 's not bad , but nowhere near as good as some later ones . the plot is marginally interesting , but it was hard to keep characters straight and the dialog did n't sound very natural . dr. berry ( who just takes the whole work week off to investigate ) talks more like a cheesy `` private eye '' than a doctor . also annoying was the use of footnotes and endnotes to explain various medical terms and concepts - nice to know but annoying to look up
1	excellent book - telling a shocking but real story of genocide on an unbelievable scale .
0	the book i am going to talk about is the book arms and the man by bernard shaw . i really did not like this book because it was hard for me to understand . the reason i did n't like it was because it was challenging for me . the english was hard to understand . i liked how the writer wrote the book and i would probably look for another one of his books . this book was more like an opera with out music . if i could have and known to i probably would not have this enthusiastic about the book . one reason i picked the book was because it was dealing with war and i thought it would have been cool to read about war , but when i got more in to the book it was really not about war it was more about a love at war . if you 're an older audience it would be a good book , or if you 're looking for a good love-war story .
0	let me say right off the bat , i am a skeptic , but still i loved author gary goldschneider 's first two books from this series : the secret language of birthdays and the sl of relationships . but this one , the secret language of destiny is a bore . rather than offering two pages to each birth date , as birthdays did , or a half of a page as relationship did , this book gives the reader a short 1/4 page paragraph that allegedly sums up the destiny of those born in each of the 48 personology periods . this information is so general and by the way so boring that it could relate to anyone if in fact you do n't fall asleep reading it . for this reason , i do not recommend the secret language of destiny . -- regina mcmenami
0	two of us read this book and we were both disappointed . characters are depressing and annoying . the storyline is predictable . we both loved john 's two last books but fiction is not his forte . i would not recommend this book to anyone
0	i must agree witht he reviewer who commented about the book being written by committee . the narrative is choppy and lacking not only key details , but also historical background . because it 's an autobiography , i do n't necessarily think that it 's fair to damn the book for being self-centered ; it is about him . i do feel , however , that the book needs better editing and a bit more self-examination . it 's an okay addition to one 's list of books about everest expeditions - which i must admit , i 've developed a morbid fascination with after recently re-reading `` into thin air '' . i would n't , however , use it as my primary source for information or impressions
0	i really wanted to like this book and the beginning started out great . a shocking murder is committed in the town of newpointe , then another . meanwhile , fireman mark branning has moved out and is separated from his wife allie . there is a serial killer targeting the wives of firemen and allie and mark must fight through their struggles for the sake of their marriage . i wanted to like this book because it is a christian novel with a good purpose . ninety percent of the books i 've read have been secular but i 'm starting to read more christian novels . but to me , this book fails for three reasons : the marriage conflict between mark and allie is n't believable , the serial killer plot collapses under its own weight , and the spiritual message is confusing and disappointing . mark and allie 's marriage is suffering because she thinks he had an affair and he has n't convinced her otherwise . seeing your husband hugging another woman is not proof of adultery , but it is grounds for suspicion . yet , allie assumes mark is cheating on her because she witnessed him hugging another woman . it seems to me the truth would be discovered in the resulting fight . instead , mark and allie separate and allie sees no hope for her marriage because of that hug and what she assumes was an affair . blackstock does a poor job of framing the conflict between mark and allie . throughout the book , references are made to allie believing mark had an affair with issie . allie refers to mark 's act as `` adultery '' and recalls him `` lying '' his way out of it after allie caught him hugging issie . their marriage is struggling , but blackstock should have given more reasons why allie assumed adultery other than a hug because throughout the book , mark says he did n't have an affair and allie chalks it up to one of his lies . later in the novel , blackstock gives more reason for their conflict but by then its too late . the serial killer story is poorly done , and it also seems everybody knows everybody in this book . when they book a suspect at the end , it seems ridiculous . the police work feels like it was written by an amateur . one line in the novel , `` as much as the evidence pointed to xxx , stan did n't want to believe it . '' in my opinion , the evidence did n't point to that person and stan , the detective , seems foolish for believing it . there is n't any rhythm or flow to the police work or the serial killer in the story . there is no sense of setting in the book . there are too many characters that no each other yet little context in how they know each other . finally , this book talks about god and prayer and being `` saved '' throughout the book , and that 's great . with a serial killer on the loose , a lot of bad things are happening and the characters react to this in a bad way . at one point , a conversation goes like this : `` how can the murder be part of god 's plan ? '' `` maybe it is n't '' `` that would mean god is n't in control . '' `` he is in control , but he allows some things to happen . '' then at another point , mark says to allie , `` i 'm going to be fine , it 's time to trust the lord . he 's taken care of us so far . '' then allie says : `` but i do n't know what his plan is . i do n't know how he wants this to end . i do n't know what he wants to teach us . '' at other points in the book , characters say that god has a plan and maybe the serial killer is part of god 's plan and that through god 's plan , all things can be used for good . this line of logic is infuriating . bad things happen to everyone , including god 's people . god does n't `` allow '' a serial killer to shoot and burn your wife . that 's a horrible message to send to a non-christian who may have lost someone in a car wreck . telling them it was part of god 's plan is the quickest way to turn someone from god . god is obviously there for people when something bad happens to help them through it and to find the good in it and god can even keep bad things from happening to christians . but like above , where allie was afraid because she thought god might have chosen to have her killed to teach a lesson , god does n't willfully kill people . it comes down to the simple fact that all people , including serial killers and christians , have choices to make and have free will . i 'm surprised i wrote so much on an 8 year old book but i wanted it to be a good book .
0	what to write ? the book is kinda story book , and gives passages after passages . if you are looking for a book that gives exercises to develop your psychic power , this one 's not for you
1	this book provides a good and clear overview of the subject of mysql . this is a thick book that covers a lot of material . the last chapters even provided introductions to application development with c , perl and php . mysql : the complete reference really seemed like an actual complete reference . while it may not go to deep into every subject it does at least briefly cover each topic . most of the focus was on sql ( structured query language ) though . there were only a few minor issues with this book aside from minor grammatical errors . for one thing , you would occasionally have to modify the sample tables before you could even start the exercise . also , it would have been nice having more sample tables and data so i could follow along in more of the examples . frequently , my result set would n't quite match the one in the book . additionally , some of the command would n't even execute or would return an error message . lastly , the chapters on development were pretty useless unless you are already familiar with one of the languages . but , i believe many of the above problems where because of version differences and the fact that i was running mysql on windows . although windows instructions were given as well the book examples were still more oriented towards a unix installation . also , mysql would be several versions newer on my computer . i believe that made a difference on some of the results as well . and for windows administration its better just to use one of the suggested gui programs since many of the commands were difficult to run from the command prompt . so , i was n't quite able to follow along with all the examples for one reason or another . nevertheless , there were still plenty of quality examples i could follow along in . in addition , there was still a lot to learn from just reading through the material . overall , this book works well as a reference or for working the chapters in order . even though the book 's user level is n't indicated i believe it provides a fine introduction for a beginner .
1	the book uses cartoons to emphasize the text . it 's always interesting to see what common words different cultures use to describe the human condition . wastes a lot of space , though . worth the price
0	i loved the first carole matthews novel i read , `` for better or worse '' , and picked this up in an airport hoping to be entertained once again . it kept me entertained while on a three and a half hour flight , but only because i didnt ' have anything else to do . i am the type of person who has to finish a book once they start but it was really hard for me to even pick this one up again after getting off the plane . i totally disagree with the premise behind the whole thing and found it completely pointless . there were no redeeming qualities and few parts in the book even worth mentioning . to me , matthews expects you to feel sorry for a woman whose married lover decided he needed to be with his wife and kids instead of leaving them for her . i think this is a horrible/unrealistic messgage . if you want to read something good , pick up a jane green novel instead .

1	i took my last science course about 40 years ago and had forgotten how interesting science can be . this book is not light reading and some people will probably not get past the first few pages but i really enjoyed it . i found tons of new information on mushrooms in spite of the fact that i studied mushrooms in college ( until my father decided science was not for girls and convinced me to go to law school . yep , those were the good old days . ) you will enjoy it as long as you take into account that it is a scientific book , perfect for geeks
0	i too read the ta for tots to my 3-5 year-old 30 years ago . she loved it a lot so i 've been looking for it again , this time for my grand-daughter . even though the title is different from the original one i knew , i purchased it and read it as soon as i received it . bottomline : this story is _not_ the original one and i do n't like it at all . other than showing stereotypical happy prince and princess fairy tale characters ( which i can live with up to a point ) , i saw bunches of red flags when i got to the evil witch , drawn with a full-blown ugly face `` who was very clever and devised a very wicked plan '' . unhappy because there are so many happy warm-fuzzy people around she freely starts giving away cold pricklies . without enough warm fuzzies ( we read earlier ) it puts people `` in danger of developing a sickness in their backs which caused them to shrivel up and die '' . ouch . so instead of embracing the wisdom of old women , here we have another story that villifies them ( ok , i 'm a psychotherapist also and know all too well how these images affect us all ) . no , it 's not funny , and there is no way i would introduce this book to any child . the book also does not do a good job of showing clear examples of what warm fuzzies and cold pricklies really are , as the original book did . too bad , for using images of `` warm fuzzies '' and `` cold pricklies '' is an easy way to introduce feelings and consequences of behaviors to young children . i am returning the book .

0	the sub-title of this book is very misleading . it does not contain `` an action-oriented approach '' to raising your self-esteem - unless you count sitting down with pen and paper as an action . the book is centered on sentence completion exercises where you write the beginning of a sentence at the top of a page ( `` one of the things i dislike about myself is ... '' , `` one of my emotions i have trouble accepting is ... '' ) and then complete the sentence with whatever comes to mind . for some unexplained reason each sentence requires its own sheet of paper ; and there are a lot of them , so be prepared to go through a lot of paper . sure , completing sentences technically counts as an `` action '' . but if you 're like me , `` action-oriented '' implies some sort of cognitive-behavioral therapy that gives you exercises to go out and do in the world , not sitting alone and writing out your thoughts . for someone with social anxiety the last thing i needed was more solitary introspection . branden gives examples of breakthroughs that his patients had doing sentence completion with him in therapy ; but alas , the practice helped me in no way . your mileage may vary , but i would n't recommend this book to anyone
1	ellen wright has done it again . this time , with meredith brokaw . and the two have combined to put together a wonderful array of recipes that are easy to follow and wonderful to serve to guests . often at my dinner parties i refer to ellen wright 's previous books . but now big sky opens a new door to cooking and presents inviting and simple recipes that will have your guests in awe of your skills . even for simple family meals , you will find yourself referring to big sky time and time again ... i do n't know what i did before big sky was published . this is a five-star cookbook that everyone should have in their home .
0	good , but it simply was n't actionous enough . i do n't mind having no action in a book ( otherwise how else could i love foundation so much ? ) , but children was a book that needed to have action in it . unfortunately it did n't really . too much philosophical babble that i had to re-read to get it . slightly reminiscent of card 's later shadow series with the sheer amount of internal monologue . too much about jane , not enough about the pequeninos and barely anything about ender , which annoyed me . to my shock ender 's death did not really impact me in any way , beyond -- '' huh ? wait ... ender is dead ? `` , so little was his role in the book . he probably talked for only about twelve pages altogether . edit : from now on i am never giving a book that i halfway like two stars again because each time , i receive the urge to change my rating to three stars . just keep in mind that while it says two , it means three
0	i ca n't give this book more than two stars , and that 's being generous . mr. hall does present some interesting ideas , but unfortunately , his editors have done him a huge disservice . here are the first three sentences of stage i , on page 23 ; essentially what we have now -- nanoscale science and technology -- including the ability to image at the atomic scale with scanning probe microscopes , and a very limited ability to manipulate , that is , by pushing things around with the same scanning probes . a scanning probe is essentially like feeling something with a stick . because you have a computer behind it , you can touch it in a very close grid of points and produce a picture . i made it through the first fifty pages , and it did n't get any better . i do n't know if mr. hall had a final read before publication , or not , but someone should have stopped this book from being published until it was properly edited .
0	this novel comes off like a high schooler wanting to write about the movie and music industries . in between the entertainment biz cliches , the author can only think to put various assination hits . some of the characters are interesting but not believable , and they certainly ca n't make up for the braindead plot . read some of his other novels and skip this one
0	this series may be good for a laugh . some of the writing is engaging . but the premise is absurd . why , in this day and age , should anyone accept the world-view of the bible ? a book that tells us to buy and sell slaves , stone our wives to death if they accept some other tribe 's beliefs , and subordinate our minds to an absolute despot up in the clouds of mt . sinai ? in a sense , bible believers have been `` left behind '' since the 1700s enlightenment . tom paine 's `` the age of reason '' showed the god of the bible to be a cruel , vindictive monster . and what did thomas jefferson call the book of revelations ? `` the ravings of a madman . '' read this series , if you like . enjoy parts of it . but make no mistake : to take any of this seriously , you have to regress to a prehistoric world-view , before men learned to think , to ask questions ; before logic or science -- a time when dazed , superstitious primitives believed stars could fall to the earth , if they did n't grovel humbly enough to their supposed god . do the absurdities and contradictions bother no one ? when the `` sheep '' are raptured up to heaven , their clothes are left behind . so heaven is a nudist colony ? the basic contradiction , of course , lies in using worldly action ( some of it exciting ) to proselytize for the unworldly , the supernatural . but why should we care whether any of the `` good '' guys gets killed ? and why should they mind -- wo n't they go straight up to heaven ? that 's what they want , is n't it ? why even lift a finger against the `` bad '' guys -- did n't christ say , `` resist not evil '' ? worried about who will win ? `` god '' is infinitely powerful . so jesus ( who is 1/3 of god -- or something like that ) is sure to win when armageddon rolls around , in book 12 of the series . and the `` sheep '' -- the believers -- will happily worship him , looking just like the pictures of dim-witted , bovine people you see in the tracts jehovah 's witnesses leave at your door . the going price for a used copy of `` tribulation force '' is one cent . does that tell you something ? actually , the story-telling is worth more . the basic premise is worth less . perhaps it averages out
0	have to agree with earlier post , book looks nice and clear but numerous errors make actually using ( vs. just browsing ) the material very difficult . 7th edition adi section has numerous mislabed equations , incorrect data values , unfortunate . suggest look elsewhere for a numerical analysis book
1	if you like fantasy and are not acquainted with the works of andre norton , then this is an excellent starting point . believable , heroic characters and a well thought-out `` witch world '' combine to make for an enjoyable read . simon tregarth is transported through a mysterious gate into a world populated by people and other things not people . a struggle goes on between good and evil , and it 's not clear who is winning . ( but , we know who wins in the end - `` good '' , of course . ) the style of writing - more of a story that unfolds as it is read - is one strength that characterizes her writings . that , and the fascinating settings , imaginative perils faced , and strong likable characters make this a `` must read '' . this is a refreshing hard-to-put-down story . it does not suffer from the typical overinflated , overwordy , overcomplicated , and overcharacterized ( and lifeless ) features of the usual fantasy megathon offered today
1	this was a very revealing look into how steroids played a role in baseball player success starting in the 1980s . this was an influential book which began a congressional search into the use of steroids in baseball .
0	i wanted to like this book , but i had to give up in the end . if the overall vignette concept is attractive enough , the execution of detail is n't -- kosinski ca n't write . he tries and eventually fails to convey what he deems important , whereas the reader is always expected to discover `` depth '' in simplicity . nothing to be recommended for
1	excellent . as the title states the `` ultimate '' . should be the first book purchased , borrowed or stolen for the enthusiast
1	this is a wonderful overview of a critical sector of the western front . across the region known as flanders , three particularly brutal battles were fought during the first world war with a horrendous loss of life suffered for minimal territorial gains . this book provides enough information about these battles to be informative yet unlike many military histories it avoids becoming boring because it is not overly detailed . it also discusses the battles from all perspectives including the high ranking politicians , the often inept generals but especially from the viewpoint of the poor infantrymen who suffered incredible hardships including shelling , bombing , machine gun fire , gas attacks and wretched weather conditions . in addition the author has a wonderful approach to writing making the book a very absorbing read that is difficult to put down . it is a shame so many historians , including such military writers as david glantz , do not emulate groom 's style
0	while it may have been well written , this book is disturbing and disgusting to put it mildly . if you or anyone you know are pregnant , or contemplating or trying to have children , do not read this book ! this is one book i can honestly say in retrospect , i would rather have failed the test on than ever have read
0	i was very disapointed with this book . it 's a large volume of just opinions . the profile is somewhat useful , about 20 pages of good stuff , but the rest could be trashed
0	i must say that this book does has a lot of pictures in it showing the aspects of shakespear 's world and plays . they are very good and intertaining but i must warn you that the book has a whole chapter with illustrations ( in detail ) of people having sex . the book is probably very good if you like reading text books , and do n't mind these pictures , but i was just too grossed out . if you are teaching lit in college and/or studying shakespeare , this is probably the book that you should use , but you should flip through the book first ( i.e : library , book store ) to see if that is what you want on your book shelves .
1	i agree with the other reviewers . this book is outstanding . if you enjoyed such books as `` the davinci code , '' `` angels and demons , '' etc. , you will enjoy this one . bravo to tess gerritsen . i am never disappointed with any of her works
1	this is a cleverly constructed book of several parts and a few recurring motifs . jones , a welsh methodist , everton fc supporter , london hack and oxford ( arts ? ) graduate , goes to live in parma , italy where his beloved has established herself . he divides his book into nine separate chapters and tries to weave them together as well as his excellent english and his motifs will allow . the first chapter discusses nuances of the italian language and he uses those nuances to propound that italy is a much more nuanced country than england and that its culture is infinitely more refined . an entire chapter brings the nuances of italian culture to bear on football and he waxes very lyrical about the local youth and whatever immigrants are around playing ball as the sun goes down . the football allows us to place italian village life in our minds and to empathize very much with it . the last chapter is an entire ode to italy . it is written largely in the second person and it tells of `` you '' going through the village and everything there appealing to the aesthetic in `` you '' . the english is beautiful and it achieves its purpose in making you close the book with a warm glow . mission accomplished . the chapter on italy 's catholic religion and its protestant and other minorities could have done with much improvement . italy 's catholicism is more complicated than the padre pio cult and the protestants of the north surely have their faults as well . the chapter looks like it came from several previous publications he wrote . the politics chapters build on the hypothesis that the fascist and proto communist factions are still at war with each other and that politicians like berlusconi exploit this for their own nefarious ends . he does a good job of tying the warring world war two factions in with the protagonists and antagonists of later squabbles . he does not like berlusconi and his polished prose does not quite hide this fact . my opinion of this book is that jones sat down with his material and tied it all together into a very passable but rather superficial book which is nevertheless well worth the money being charged .
1	the hebrew , aramaic , and greek dictionaries are done very well , compared to the old strong 's concordance i have
1	very topical . easy read . hope people in the know read this and give serious thought to the potential for something like this happening . gives good reason why border control should be taken more serious by everybody . looking forward to reading other books by mr. bell
0	`` people say again and again that philosophy does n't really progress , that we arestill occupied with the same philosophical problems as were thegreeks.but the people who say this do n't understand why ishas to be so . it is becauseour language has remained the same and keeps seducing us into asking the same questions . as longas there continues to be a verb 'to be ' that looks as if it functions in the same way as 'to eat ' and 'to drink ' , as long as we stillhavethe adjectives 'identical ' , 'true ' , 'false ' , 'possible ' , as long as we continueto talk of a river of time , of an expanseof space , etc. , etc. , people will keepstumbling over the samepuzzling difficulties and find themselves staring atsomethingwhich no explanation seems capable of clearing up.and what'smore , this satisfies a longing for the transcendent , because , insofar as peoplethinkthey can see `the limits of human understanding ' , theybelieve of course thatthey can see beyond these. `` ''philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of ourintelligence by means of language `` `` ambition is the death of thought '' ' these three quotes are from ludwig wittgenstein who redefined philosophysome70 years ago ( but most people have yet to find this out ) .dennett , though he has been a philosopher for some40 years , is one them . it is also curious that both he and his prime antagonist , john searle , studied under famous wittgensteinians ( searle with john austin , dennett with gilbert ryle ) but searle got the point and dennett did not . dennett is a hard determinist ( though he trys to sneak reality in the back door ) , and perhaps this is due to ryle , whose famous book 'the concept of mind ' ( 1949 ) continues to be reprinted . that book did a great job of exorcising the ghost but it left the machine . dennett enjoys making the mistakes wittgenstein , ryle ( andmany others since ) have exposed in detail . byaccident , just before this book , i had read ''the minds i '' , which dennett coauthored withdouglas hofstadter in 1981 . they made some bad mistakes ( see my review ) , and saddest of all , they reprinted twofamous articles that pointed the wayout of the mess -- -nagel 's `what is like to be a bat ? ` and an early version of john searle 's chinese room argument explaining why computers do n't think . nagel pointed out that we do noteven know how to recognize whata concept of a bat 's mind would be like . searle similarly explained how we lack a way to conceptualize thinking and how itdiffersfrom what a computer does ( eg , it can translate chinese without understanding it ) . likewise , we lack a clear test for recognizing what countsas good vs bad -- or just intelligible -- for many philosophical and scientific concepts . our use of the words consciousness , choice , freedom , intention , particle , thinking , determines , wave , cause , happened , event ( and so on endlessly ) are rarely a source of confusion but as soon as we leave normal life and enter philosophy ( and anydiscussion detached from the environment in which language evolved ) chaos reigns . wittgenstein was the first to understand why and to point out how to avoid this . unfortunately , he died inhis prime , his works are composed almost entirely of a series of examples of how the mind ( language ) worksand he never wroteany popular books , so understanding of his work is restricted to a very few . searle is one of the world 's leadingphilosophers and has written manyextremely clear and highly regarded articles and books , some of which have pointed out the glaring defects in dennett'swork.his review `` consciousness explained away '' of dennetts 1991 book`'consciousness explained '' and his book '' the mystery of consciousness '' are very well known , and show , in a way that isamazingly clear for philosophical writing , why neither dennett ( nor any of the hundreds of philosophersandscientists who have written on this topic ) havecome closetoexplaining the hard problem -- ie , how do you conceptualizeconsciousness.many suspect we will never be able to conceptualizeany of the reallyimportant things , but it isclear that we are nowhere near it now . dennett has mostly ignored his critics but has favored searle with vituperative personal attacks.searle has been accused by dennett and others of being out to destroy cognitive psychology which is quite funny as modern philosophy is ( mostly ) a branch of cognitive psychology and searle has made it very clear for 30 years that we are a good example of a biological machine that is conscious , thinks , etc , . he just points out that we do n't have any idea how this happens . searle characterizes as ''intellectualpathology '' , the views ofdennett andall those who denythe existence of thevery phenomena they setout to explain . dennett repeats his mistakes here andleaves his reply to his critics to the penultimate page of the book , where we are told that they areall mistaken and it is a waste of spaceto show how ! unsurprisingly , there isnot one reference towittgenstein or searle in theentire book.there arehowever , many references to other old schoolphilosophers who are as confusedas he is . like most people , it does not cross his mindthatthe very inference engineshe thinks with are forcinghim to cometo certainconclusions and that these will oftenbe quite unconnectedwith or wrong about the way things are in the world . they are a jumble of evolutionary curiositieswhich do various tasks in organizing behavior that were useful for survivalhundreds of thousands of years ago.wittgenstein was a pioneerin doingthought experiments in cognitive psychologyand beganto elucidate the nature of these engines and the subtletiesof language in the 30 's , and thus he made the sorts of commentsthat this review begins with . dennett says ( p98 ) that his view is compatibilism , ie , that free will ( whichi hopewe can equate with choice ) is compatible with determinism ( ie , that '' there is at any instant exactly one physically possible future '' -- p25 ) . he wants to show that determinism is not the same as inevitablity . however , the whole book is smoke and mirrors by means of which choice , in the sense we normally understand it , disappears and we are left with `` choice `` , which is something we can not choose . naturally , this echoes the fate of consiousness in his earlier book `` consciousness explained `` . it is remarkable that , at a time when we are just beginning to reach the point where we might be able to understand the basics of how a single neuron works ( or how an atom works for that matter ) , that anyone should think they can make the leap to understanding the whole brain and to explain its most complex phenomena . please recall the last sentence of wittgenstein from the opening quote : ''and what'smore , this satisfies a longing for thetranscendent , because , insofar aspeoplethinkthey can see `the limits of human understanding ' , theybelieve of course thatthey can see beyond these. `` the relation between language , thought and reality is extraordinarily complex and everyone gets lost . if one is very , very careful , some understanding is possible , but dennett throws caution to the winds and we are dragged into the quicksand . there are at least 3 different topics here ( evolution of our brain , choice and morality ) and dennett tries vainly to weld them together into a coherent account of how freedom evolves from the deterministic crashing of atoms . there is , however , no compelling reason to accept that bouncing atoms ( or his favorite example , the game of life running on a computer ) are isomorphic with reality . he knows that quantum indeterminacy ( or the uncertainty principle ) is a major obstacle to determinism however defined ( and has been taken by many as an escape to freedom ) but dismisses it due to the fact that such events are too rare to bother with . by extension , its unlikely that any such event will happen now or even in our whole lifetime in our brain , so we appear to be stuck with a determined brain ( whatever that may be ) . however , the universe is a big place and its been around a long time ( perhaps forever ) and if even one such quantum effect occurs it would seem to throw the whole universe into an indeterminate state . the notion ''there is at any instant exactly one physically possible future '' can not be true if at any instant a quantum indeterminacy can occur -- in this case there would seem to be infinitely many possible futures . this recalls one of the escapes from the contradictions of physics -- each instant our universe is branching into infinitely many universes . he correctly rejects the idea that quantum indeterminacy gives us the answer to how we can have choice . this obvious idea has been suggested by many but the problem is that nobody has any idea how to specify an exact sequence of steps which starts with the equations of physics and ends up with the phenomena of consciousness ( or any other emergent phenomenon ) . if so , they will definitely win at least one nobel prize , for not only will they have explained consciousness , they will have explained the universal phenomenon of emergence ( how higher order properties emerge from lower ones ) . so , they would have to solve the 'easy ' problem ( to determine the exact state of the brain corresponding to some mental state and preferably specify the exact position of all the atoms in the brain over time-ignoring uncertainty ) and the 'hard ' one ( what exactly correlates with or produces consciousness or choice etc ? ) . and while they are at it how about also doing the impossible -- an exact and full solution to the quantum field equations for a brain . it is very well known that these equations are uncomputable , even for one atom or a vacuum , as it would require an infinite amount of computer time . but infinite will do for one atom so maybe a brain will take no longer . he starts off on the first page appealing to the laws of physics for protection against fantastic notions such as immaterial souls , but physics is made of notions just as fantastic ( uncertainty , entanglement , wave/particle duality , schrodinger 's dead/alivecat etc ) and as feynmann said many times `` nobody understandsphysics ! '' many think nobody ever will . on pg 2 he says our values have little to do with the goals of our cells and on pg 2 to3 that our personality differences are due to how our ''robotic teams are put togther , over a lifetime of growth and experience. `` this is a bald dismissal of human nature , of the abundant evidence that our differences are to a large extent programmed into our genes and fixed in early childhood , and is typical of his constant confused wandering back and forth between determinism and environmentalism . on page 9 he notes that free will is a problem and our attitudes to it make a difference , but for whom ? nobody but philosophers . we make choices . what 's the problem ? one has to step outside life to experience a problem and then everything becomes a problem . what are consciousness , pain , yellow , intention , matter , quarks , gravity etc. ? i doubt that anyone has ever experienced a fundamental change in their interactions with people or their decision making processes due to their thinking about choice . this shows that there is something strange about such questions . wittgenstein would probably say that the language games are different . there are games for language connected with the cognitive templates for decisions or seeing colors etc , and thinking philosophically is operating them in decoupled mode . decoupled modes permit thinking about the past , planning for the future , guessing the mental states of others , etc , but if one takes the results in the wrong way and starts to think `'john will try to steal my wallet '' , rather than just imagining that john might do it , confusion enters and those who can not turn off the decoupled mode or distinguish it from coupled mode , enter the realm of pathology . some aspects of schizophrenia and other mental illness might be seen this way -- they lose control of which mode they are in , eg , notbeing able to see the difference between the motives people have and the motives they might have . one can then see much of the philosophizing people do as operating in these decoupled modes but failing to be able to keep in front of them the differences from the normal mode . normal mode -- eg , what is that lion doing -- was undoubtedly the first one evolved and decoupled modes -- what did that lion do last time or what does he intend to do next -- evolved later . this was probably never a problem for animals -- any animal that spent too much time worrying about what might happen would not be very successful contributing to the gene pool . it is interesting to speculate that only when humans developed culture and began degeneratinggenetically , could large numbers of people survive with genes that led them to spend alot of time in decoupled modes . hence , we have philosophy and this book , which is mostly about running the decision templates in decoupled mode where there are no real consequencesexcept earning royalties for putting the results in a book for other people to use to run their engines in decoupled mode . ' let us alter wittgenstein 's quote to read : ''as longas there continues to be a verb 'to decide ' that looks as if it functions in the same way as 'to eat ' and 'to drink ' , as long as we continueto talk of freedom of action , of saying i wish i had done otherwise , etc. , etc. , people will keepstumbling over the samepuzzling difficulties andfind themselves staring atsomethingwhich no explanation seems capable of clearing up . '' as withmost philosophy books , nearly every page , often every paragraph , changes from one type of language game to another without noticing that now one would have to be joking or dreaming or acting in a play or reciting a story , etc , and not actually intending anything nor describing an actual situation in the world . on page 10 he says we count on free will for the whole way of thinking about our lives , like we count on food and water , but who ever , outside philosophy , standing in front of lunch counter full of food , ever thinks how fine it is that they have free will so they can pick coke instead of mineral water ? even if i want to be a serious compatibilist and try thinking this in decoupled mode , i have to exit and enter nondecoupled mode to make the actual choice . only then can i go back to decoupled mode to wonder what might have happened if i had not had the ability to make a real choice . wittgenstein noted how pretend games are parasitic on real ones ( this is not a trivial observation ! ) . the ability to engage in very complex decoupled scenarios is already evident in 4 year old children . so i would say that normally , nobody counts on having choice , but rather we just choose . on the same page he shows again that he does not grasp cognitive basics . he says we learn to conduct our lives in the conceptual atmosphere of choice , and that `'it appears to be a stable and ahistorical construct , as eternal and unchanging as arithmetic , but it is not . '' and on page 13 -- ''it is an evolved creation of human activity and beliefs '' . the whole thrust of cognitive psychology is that we do not learn the basics of planning , deciding , promising , resenting , etc , but that these are built-in functions of the inference engines that work automatically and unconsciously and start running in very early childhood . there is no evidence that they change as we grow , or are in any way subject to our beliefs , only that they mature just as our body does . on pg 14 he suggests its probable that our having free will depends on our believing we have it ! do we believe we see an apple , feel a pain , are happy ? the language game of belief is very different from that of knowing . we can believe we have a dollar in our pocket but if we take it out and look at it we ca n't meaningfully then say that we still believe it ( except as a joke etc. ) . the inference engine can run in decoupled ( belief ) mode so we can imagine havingchoices or making them , but in life we just make them and it is only in very odd situations we can say that we believe we made a choice . but dennett is saying thisis the universal case . if making a choice had any dependence on belief than so would everything everything else -- consciousness , seeing , thinking , etc . if we take this seriously ( and he says 'the serious problems of free will ' ) then we are getting into trouble and if we actually try to apply it to life , then madness is minutes away . . on page 65 et seq. , he discusses causation , intention and the `informal predicates ' that we use to describe atoms etc , but cognitive resarch has shown that we describe all objects with a limited number of ontological categories which we analyse with our intuitive physics modules and that when agents ( ie animals or people or things like them -- ie , ghosts or gods ) are involved we use our concepts ( engines ) for agency , intuitive psychology , social minds , etc to decide how to behave . there is almost certainly no causation module but rather it will involve all of these and other inference engines , depending on the precise situation . discussing possibility and necessity is much easier if one talks in terms of the output of our modules for intuitive physics , agency , ontological categories etc . of course there is no mention here of wittgenstein 's many incisive comments on causation , intention , deciding , nor of searle 's now classic works on intention and social reality . he spends much time on ainslie 's book 'breakdown of will ' , in which is discussed the hyperbolic discounting faculties ( ie , inference engines ) by which we evaluate probable outcomes . hemakes much of the excellent work of robert frank on altruism , emotion and economics , but the book he cites was 15 years old when this book was published . it was bingham 's idea , amplified by frank and by boyd and richardson ( 1992 ) that cooperation was greatly stimulated by the evolution of means for punishing cheaters . he suggests these as examples of darwinian approaches that areobligatory and promising . indeed they are , and in fact they are standard parts of economic , evolutionary and cognitive theory , but unfortunately , he makes little reference to the other work in these fields . all that work tends to show that people do not choose but their brains choose for them . he does not establish any convincing connection between this work and the general problem of choice . onpg 216 he says that making oneself so that one could not have done otherwise is a key innovation in the evolutionary ascent to free will , and that we can only be free if we learn how to render ourselves insensitive to opportunities . but where this ability resides is not revealed for several chapters ! dennett has a penchant for hiding his ideas in a massive amount of rather irrelevant text . again , he gets things backwards , as there is a vast body of very good evidence from biology and psychology that we are get the feelings that we should behave in some way from our inference engines and these are not provided by some part of our conscious self , but by the automatic and unconscious operation of the engines . as he notes , hundreds of experiments with the prisoner 's dilemma and related protocols have shown how easy it is to manipulate people 's choices and that their calculations are not conscious and deliberate at all . when the situation is manipulated to make them conscious , they are much slower and less reliable . so , there has been constant pressure of natural selection to make the engines fast and automatic and inacessible to deliberate thought . dennett says `we make ourselves ' so that we could not do otherwise and that this is the basis of morality and choice . the evidence would seem to be exactly the opposite . our inference engines give us basic moral intuitions and we generally act in accord with the results . if we or others do not we feel guilt , outrage , resentment etc , then cheater genes will invade the population and this is one of the main theories as to how a good part of morality evolved.our genes make us so we ca n't ( mostly ) do otherwise , not our will or whatever dennett thinks can do it . we can often choose to do otherwise but our own intuitions and the knowledge of social disapproval usually serve to limit our choices . these intuitions evolved in small groups between 50,000 and some millions of years ago . in the modern world the intuitions are often not to our advantage and the social controls weak . this is a prime reasonfor the chaos in the world . on pg 225 he finally sneaks in a definition of free will as ''a complicated snarl of mechanistic causes that look likedecision making ( from certain angles ) '' . he claims that thisplays all the valuable roles of free will but lacks some ( unspecified ) properties possessed by traditional free will . the smoke is thick but i am pretty sure one of those unspecified properties is what we understand aschoice . he insists ( top pg 226 ) that his naturalistic account of decision making leaves plenty of room for moral responsibility , but making ourselves so we could n't do otherwise does not seem to describe the way we actually function , nor does it seem to leave any room for morality , as that would seem to consist precisely in being able to do otherwise . he does not propose any test for deciding if a choice is voluntary or forced and i doubt he could do so . normally if someone asks us to move our hand , we know what counts as having a choice , but , typical of philosophers , i expect that regardless of whether it moves or not he will count both as evidence for his position . at this point he also starts his discussion of libet 's well known work on conscious attention which is the only part of the book that i felt was worth my time . on page 253 et seq. , he sneaks in his definition of conscious will -- the ''brains user illusion of itself '' ' which has as one of its main roles providing ''me with the means of interfacing with myself at other times `` . and `` illusory or not , conscious will is the persons guide to his or her own moral responsibility for action. `` he says the trick we need is to see that `` i` ' control what is happening inside the ''simplification barrier '' ... ''where decision making happens '' . `` mental events '' become conscious by ''entering into memory '' . ''the process of self description ... is what we are '' . the crucial thing is that choice is possible because the self is distributed over space ( the brain ) and time ( memories ) . he realizes this is going to leave many incredulous ( everyone who can follow this and really understands ! ) . ''i know that many people find it hard to graspthis idea or take it seriously . it seems to them to be a trickwith mirrors , some kind of verbal slight of hand that whisksconsciousness , and the real self , out of the picture just when it was about to be introduced . '' many will say he took the words out of their mouth , but i would say it 's incoherent and thateverythingwe know about consciousness and the whole universe ( making the obvious extensions of such claims ) was gone long beforewegot this far . on pg 259 he says that culture has made us rational animals ! this is a stunning denial of human nature ( ie , genetics and evolution ) coming from the person who wrote 'darwin 's dangerous idea '' ! presumably he is talking about his idea that it is memories spread over space ( the brain and other people ) and time that give us choices and morals and consciousness ( line 6 from bottom ) . he says consciousness is a user-interface but it is never made clear who or where the user is and how it interfaces with the brain ( you will have to suffer through 'consciousness explained to find that there is no answer there either ) . though he makes many references to evolutionary and cognitive psychology , he seldom uses any of the terminology that has been current for decades ( social mind , intuitive psychology , coalitional intuitions etc ) and clearly is not familiar with most of the concepts . if he means that we got the fine details of morality from culture , thats ok , but this is the icing on the cake and the cake was baked by the genes . we are also told here that r ( by which he means evolution here , but other things elsewhere ) has given us the self and that language creates new kind of consciousness and morality . i am sure that he will get little agreement on this . it seems quite clear that consciousness and the basics of morality evolved in primates ( and earlier ) long before spoken language ( though it is a very deep topic as to how language evolved from extant capacities in the brain ) . he continues `` morality memes arose by accident some tens of thousands of years ago `` which would be ok if he meant the icing on the cake but he clearly means the cake ! and then he says the point of morality is not the survival of our genes , which is an amazing ( and totally incorrect ) thing to say , even if he was only referring to memes . on pg 260 he claims that because we do not comprehend our ''bland dispositions to cooperate '' , they mean nothing to us , but it is the operation of our templates that is everything to us . there is ample evidence that if one of them is damaged a person can not function properly as a social being ( eg , autism ) . i would say it is the operation of the templates for intuitive psychology etc which lead dennett to the counterintuitive views that we do not have consciousness and choice in the way we think . he also says here that it was one of the major evolutionary transitions when we were able to change our views and reflect on reasons for them . this again reflects his lack of understanding of evolutionary psychology . i know of no evidence that the basic moral intuitions , like all the templates , are accessible to consciousness . we may decide our cheating was justifiable , or forgive someone else 's cheating , but we still know it was cheating ( ie , we can not change the engine ) . i suspect my ancestors a million years ago had the same feelings in the same situation but what has happened is that there are lots of other things that may be taken as relevant and that sometimes these will lead me to act contrary to my feelings . another issue is that as culture developed , one had to make many important or 'moral type` decisions for which the engines were not evolved to give a clear answer . on pg 267 he says that we now replace our `free floating rationales ' ( probably corresponding to what cognitive psychologists call our templates or inference engines ) with reflection and mutual persuasion . and on pg 286 he says that it is a child 's upbringing -- demanding and giving reasons -- that affects moral reasoning . again , he just has no grasp of what has happened in the last 30 years of research -- the templates do not change with reflection or upbringing . we are then told again that consciousness makes moral issues available over time to the self , which takes responsibility . it is not any more coherent or credible with repetition . on pg 289 he has a chapter summary which repeats the mistaken notions that it is culture that makes it possible to reflect and that choice depends on education ( memory ) and sharing . it 's clear that it is not culture but the inherited cognitive structures that make it possible to reflect and to choose and that culture determines the acceptable actions and their rewards or punishments . on pg 303 he discusses the classic philosophical barrier between 'ought'and 'is ' , unaware that our templates solved that problem long ago -- ie , they tell us how to feel about situations regarding other people . he also seems to be unaware that there are hundreds of cultural universals implanted in our genes ( eg see 'the blank slate ' ) . he often starts into what looks like its going to be a good discussion of some issue in evolutionary psychology , but invariably wanders off into philosophical arcana and winds up with more confusion . this happens on pg 261 where he states that concepts like 'praiseworthy ' were shaped over millennia by culture , while most would say the basis for such concepts is in the genes and each culture only detetermines the details of acceptable reactions to the intuitions its members get from their innate mechanisms . on pg 262 he tries to explain how an ess ( evolutionarily stable strategy ) can produce morality . his idea here is that genetic `r` produces dim understandings of morals and then culture ( memetics ) produces variations and clarifications . i would say that we all know , and much research has made clear , that we commonly get very clear results from our inference engines and only dimly understand in special cases . culture merely decides what we can do about our feelings . the last part of the book is mostly concerned with moral culpability . he refers to the legal classic by hart and honore , which i started reading 30 years ago since it 's authors were deeply influenced by wittgenstein . dennett tells us that we have control over our own morality and that thinking about morality will improve us . but , there seems no justification whatever for this view in this book . there is nothing at all here to help anyone escape from the dictates of the monkey mind . it is a defensible point of view that those who manage this do so by traveling a spiritual path that has no connection with philosophy- and there is not a hint of spirituality in this entire book -- another telling point considering that many mystics have fascinating things to say about the functioning of the mind . i find more wisdom about how to be free and moral in any of osho 's 200 books than anywhere in philosophy . one rarely finds spiritually and morally advanced people teaching at universities . there is no sign here , nor in anything he has done , that dennett is morally superior . after 40 years of thinking about morality he launches personal attacks on his critics or arrogantly dismisses them . it seems clear that , like all of us , he is trapped in the limits of his inference engines . so , how much opportunity is there to improve our morality ? it seems clear ( eg , see pinker 's `the blank slate` ) that most of our behaviour is genetic and the rest due to unknown factors in our environment , in spite of the vigorous efforts of parents and religions and political parties . on average , maybe 5 % of the variation in moral behavior ( variations are the only thing we can study ) is due to our own efforts . the moral choices that matter most today are those affecting the fate of the world . but our moral templates were not evolved to deal with overpopulation and the greenhouse effect . how remarkable it would be if just one of the hundreds of millions of educated people in the world managed to figure out what consiousness or choice or any mental phenomenon really is . and if one did , we would expect them to be a scientist at the cutting edge of research using some exotic fmri equipment and the latest parallel processing neural networked fuzzy logic computer etc . but a philosopher or physicist just sitting there thinking , coming up with the solution to the greatest puzzle there is ! and then writing a whole book about it without checking with the sceptics first . to return to the quote at the beginning -- 'ambition is the death of thought ' . indeed -- though clearly wittgenstein was thinking of interesting thoughts
1	this is such a great book i have boughten copeys for all my childern
0	i admit that i tried to read this twice and failed both times . i got to around page 20 or so . i 'll probably try again . however , if you 're an adult who has already read other philosophies i would suggest attempting to read it just so you 'll know what objectivism is about . i would n't suggest it for teens that have n't had any prior readings , though . objectivism is about the self and about `` reason '' , and it can be heady stuff for someone who has no real experience in anything else . the strange thing about the tone of the writing is that it comes across as venomous . i assume that 's in my head , but judge for yourself . her caricatures of `` the witch doctor '' ( who controls others from a spiritual perspective ) and `` attila '' ( who controls by brute force ) are actually interesting . wrong , but interesting . since objectivists rely on reason alone for their survival ( or think they do , anyway ) , it 's rather surprising the lack of logical thinking early in the book . my suggestion is to attempt to read it without dismissing her out of hand ( she 's not wrong on everything ) , or swallowing it all without using your own critical thinking skills . judging by previous reviews , it seems there were plenty of both kinds of readers . if you buy into it , you can get a feeling of superiority over others in a kind of pseudo-intellectual way . if you do n't buy into it , however , you 're evil ( either the witch doctor or attila ) and probably just too stupid to `` get it '' . why i did n't finish it yet ... i just could n't get past her ignorance of history , frankly . if you 're writing a work of fiction , the historical innacuracies do n't matter , but this is n't supposed to be fiction . i like history and most people do n't , so it probably wo n't bother most people . also , while she denounces religion , ms. rand has no problem hopping up to the pulpit herself . like all other religions and cults , the world is messed up basically because people do n't think like she does .
1	i am a huge john grisham fan . i believe the first grisham book i ever read was `` the pelican brief '' . after that , i was hooked . i admit that through the years mr. grisham 's work has become less `` grishamisc '' and not as entertaining as earlier works . but , you 'll have that with any author that cranks out as many books as he does . i first started this book by listening to it on cd . i soon decided that it would be more enjoyable to read it than listen to it . i was right ! the book starts out with action and pulls you in . the action barely lets up through the entire book . this is a different kind of action . more mental than physical . there seems to always be something going on and grisham knows how to leave you wanting more at the end of each chapter . one thing that is very different about this book than most of his works , is that there is n't really a catch at the end or a mystery to solve . generally , we find grisham leading us to a thriller ending . however , in this book , it is more of a life lesson about greed . there is no bad guy , nobody lurking in the shadows trying to harm the main character , etc . the book is about good old fashioned greed and how it can ruin your life . the characters are likeable and easy to follow . there are not too many needless chapters or boring detail that is irrelevant to the story . i found the book very easy to read and follow . i always wanted more . although the book has a different theme than most grisham books , i still really enjoyed it . it reminded me why i like to read his books so much . it proves he write good fiction without a thriller or mystery ending . if you like this one , try the eariler works as well . if you have seen the movies , it does n't matter because the books are always better and usually different in some way . this book would make a good movie , but we 'll see if anyone in hollywood agrees with me on that point . happy reading
0	unfortunately , this book is the sign of what passes for humour these days . even though it may have been remotely funny ( sometimes the author comes close to being bearable ) , the book never actually tries to be . humour is supposed to be smart . however , this book gives us the worst case of dumb
1	the story is about peter growing up with his family in north dublin and is set in the 1960 's . the tightly knit family relations with his own family and those of his extended family of lodgers , which his parents took in to supplement his father 's income , forms the backdrop to his story at 44 seville place . the pace of the book has the rhythm of the sixties . the short sentences beat out the rhythm of the sixties and keeps the tempo up-beat throughout the whole of the book . for those who have experienced dublin in the sixties this book will take you back to that place and that time . the metaphorical pieces were very touching and masterfully executed . one example of this technique was when peter tries to get to grips with his emotions concerning the possible loss of his brother frankie before frankie goes into surgery . a joy to read . da is the sun and all the minor planets revolve around him . peter takes to his role as mercury the messenger with great relish . there is a strong bond between father and son . i feel this story should not be compared to frank mccourt 's angela 's ashes . a one generation step into the future in ireland can make a very big difference in how life is experienced . it was a very enjoyable read whereby the need to laugh out loud in places could not be silenced . however there were places in the book where the need to cry out loud could also not be silenced .
0	i have listened to a bunch of dean koontz books . while listening to the second one i saw so many similarities , which really turned me off . and this flaw continued which each book i listen to , which caused me to be reluctant to buy this book . however , most of the stories were pretty good so i stuck with him . this is not the case with this book . `` cold fire '' is absolutely horrible . i so regret purchasing this book . it is so bad that i have decided to swear off dean for looooooooong while . just on a side note , `` the bad place '' is the first dk book i read and it was very entertaining .
1	this book was recommended to me by several people as i interviewed hiring managers , hr personnel , senior-level employees , and others for my own book on the job market . by all accounts , my own included , 201 best questions is comprehensive , helpful , and tactical , an important read when one is preparing for an interview . it is not an all-inclusive resource , only interview-targeted , but for what it is , the book is top-notch
1	this collection of plays is extraordinary . shepard threads tales of cartoonlike characters bound by the direst of circumstances excellently
1	i really enjoy all of mary engelbreit 's books and my little girls do , too . we like to look at them over and over again . this book is full of ideas from recipes , to summer crafts , to gardening , and to sewing so that you can make your home an interesting place to visit
1	this book introduces us to the colorful world of a bygone era , that of border radio . brilliant technicians constructed gargantuan transmitters along the border towns of texas/mexico and beamed their signal into all of north america - one angry resident complained that was all he could get on his radio . these stations were distinguished by their call signs that began with an 'x ' . this spawned an industry of singers , politicians , preachers and pitchman the type we now see on `` infomercials '' . mail was the barometer of the day - the more mail you `` pulled '' in from listeners the more clout you carried with stations - `` keep those cards and letters coming ! '' new federal regulations put an end to this wild world but not until the airwaves crackled with everyone from wolfman jack to the rev . ike - `` get out of the ghetto and get into the get-mo ! '' this is a marvelously written treasure trove that will be welcomed by anyone interested in radio , salesmanship , and american sub-cultures and the bizarre
0	i 'm a wiccan who formally practices within a traditional gardnerian coven , but practices eclectically within my private practice . i read this book because i had heard that it was recommended to my local library by a christian ; purportedly , wicca 's charm was written by an impartial writer . immediately , you realize that this is n't true . catherine sanders has a clearly stated agenda : that wiccans are simply misguided and misunderstand that what they long for is offered by christianity . i could write a long review debating the merits of sanders ' arguments . instead , i suggest that you consider this if deciding whether to read this book which sanders claims to have thoroughly researched . she relies on the writings of margot adler , carol christ , starhawk and phyllis curott ( with barely a nod to scott cunningham and ronald hutton ) to draw many of her conclusions . yet , missing from her notes are such writers as the farrars , merlin stone , raymond buckland , isaac bonewits , patricia crowley , and the matthews , to name just a few outstanding contributors to neopaganism 's base of knowledge . too often , sanders relies on the statements of young wiccans she interviewed who come across as silly and naive . in another case , she bases her thesis that women 's spirituality ( e.g. , goddess worship ) is misguided and that christianity fits the same spiritual needs that women are seeking via one speech that she heard margot adler give shortly after 9/11 . sanders requests both christians and neopagans to read her book with an open mind . a fair request . but as you 're reading , closely check out her endnotes and analyze for yourself if this book was truly researched with objectivity in mind , or whether sanders limited herself to sources that would support her belief that christianity has everything that a wiccan desires . one needs to go no further than to consider that as sanders attempts to persuade the reader that christianity has always embraced the value of women that not once does she analyze the epistles of paul .
0	i have studied the tarot for nearly 5 years and keep an open mind whenever a new book appears on the market . edain mccoy , who has written some wonderful new age material , strikes an off-putting note in this one . the spreads are certainly imaginative and are perhaps insightful to her own method of tarot interpretation , but convey confusing and ambiguous directions to the reader who is trying to understand her card placements . in several of her spreads she conveys that a card 's placement at a certain point in the spread `` may or may not '' mean some karmic element at play . the whole exercise of creating a spread is to pinpoint with a degree of accuracy the situation you wish to define . therefore , when a card `` may or may not '' mean something , that interpretation could significantly change on whether you `` may or may not '' interpret it that way , leaving the interpreter open to rationalizing a card 's meaning . tarot cards are intuitive , not rational , and their meanings can best be intuited when their placement is clearly defined without ambiguity it is difficult to have it both ways and i found working with these spreads difficult . imagine doing a celtic cross reading and the first position `` may or may not '' be the root of the issue . these spreads speak very clearly to the author , but not so to the reader . i rate it 2 stars for depth and insight into karma and past lives , but the explanations are too ambiguous .
1	as a former history major and teacher i am very familiar with the history of the crusades from the western point of view . they have been portrayed in literature , movies , and history . they have been glamorized and vilified by westerners for centuries . reading amin maalouf 's rendering of this familiar story from the view-point of arab chroniclers was like looking through alice 's looking glass at a world that is backwards from the one we know . here we do n't have just crusaders , advernturers , or even the evil conquerors that deconstructionists portray , but invaders , barbarians , and enemies of god himself . this book is a must read for everyone who is concerned about events in the middle east today . it sheds light on a crucial time in history that affects the psyche of muslims who are living right now . especially helpful is the epilogue in which maalouf explains how the collective memory of the crusades colors the way many middle-easterners see the west . it is not riveting , but very readable considering it is a translation . i enjoyed it and learned a lot
0	i 'm very disappointed in this book , although some information in it is valuable , it will take a long time to read the entire book cover to cover . it is an excellent textbook but not a handy guide to flip to on a regular basis and find ideas for what you need . although broken into sections , they are not readily found or visible . one must search the information needed as in a research assignment . the reproducibles are mainly for elementary grades . this was not stated in the very short and brief summary of it 's contents , on-line . although the price was reasonable , i 'm not pleased with the way the book is organized & amp ; printed
0	this is just another attack by organized medicine on alternative treatments and therapies , in particular chiropractic . dr. rosenfeld comes across as biased , ignorant and at times completely malicious in the information he provides . his assertion that he `` loves chiropractors is disingenous at best . '' he prefers non-specific manipulation by a doctor who can also prescribe ( toxic ) drugs . he lists warnings about chiropractic that are extremely rare , occuring one in many millions , and suggests that these are common occurances . he fails to mention that the practice of ( allopathic ) medicine is the third leading cause of preventable death in the united states , which is the very reason we need more practitioners of the so called `` alternatives '' . if you want good advice , start by avoiding books on alternative medicine written by medical doctors , especially this one ! !
0	this is a complex and detailed history chiefly of cuban exiles in south florida and the influence they have been able to wield regionally and internationally with and without the help of various u.s. administrations . in that sense , it is the story of two cities - miami and washington - and two peoples - americans and cubans . i have an objection , though , with the stone-hard style in which this volume is so meticulously , even gorgeously at times , written . didion strives to be so achingly academic that there is little real heart to this book and , worse , the result is a cold , humorless , colorless story that is at times an unappealing example of ideological abstractions and alphabet soup . the author , in her conspicuously clean and parenthetical prose , apparently is so charged by the subject of her research that she has forgotten there are people on the other end - readers . it is , in that sense , a boring little disaster of a book .
0	susanna rowson 's `` charlotte temple '' is not the first novel and certainly not the last to deal with the topic of the morally fallen woman . poor , pitiful charlotte finds herself in the midst of an immoral and unforgiving world where one transgression sends her on the road to permanent ruin . rowson encases her heroine charlotte temple within a world of virtue and vengeance . charlotte has no possible means of escaping her inevitable fate because the author/narrator makes it clear from the onset that she has written this story as a lesson to young woman . she has no real interest in charlotte as a dimensional character . charlotte simply serves as a symbol of lost virtue and symbols do not have real emotions or feelings . `` charlotte temple '' was written in 1794 and became one of the first best sellers of the newly formed america . a morally abhorrent woman who pays for her sins almost always guaranteed a best seller in the eighteenth century and now `` charlotte temple '' has been rediscovered and published in a scholarly press edition . was this reclamation of charlotte really necessary ? in the past twenty years , feminist scholars have rediscovered authors and texts that have gone out of print or been totally ignored by the literati . authors such as anne plumptre , frances burney , aphra behn , sarah fielding and charlotte lennox have been dusted off and given new literary lives . feminist scholar cathy davidson has taken charlotte temple in hand and aims to join rowson to the above list of rediscoveries . unfortunately , rowson does not warrant such treatment . rowson has a flat , humorless approach to the fallen woman story . unlike burney 's `` evelina '' or `` camilla , '' rowson does not imbue her narrative with needed levity . her pedantic iron-fisted preaching smothers the modern reader in a moral morass that confounds rather than illuminates . in many of the fallen women stories , authors would use the genre as a subversive technique to criticize the patriarchal structures . rowson does engage in such subversion within the novel . she seeks to preach to the young women who may fall victim to the unscrupulous man -- in england and america , it was not considered altogether lady-like to read a novel , so rowson would be preaching to young women who had already transgressed . rowson does not criticize men within the novel . she does not censure montraville for taking charlotte as his mistress , impregnating her and abandoning her for a wealthier woman . when he believes that charlotte has becomes his best friend 's mistress , he does not believe that she would soil her reputation even though she has ruined her life by engaging in an illicit affair with him . he aims to enact revenge upon the friend for acting `` dishonorable '' against her . yet if he had not acted dishonorably towards her , she would not have been reduced to a penniless , pregnant ex-mistress scrounging the streets for food and shelter . he never takes responsibility for his role in charlotte 's downfall . rowson had the perfect opportunity for savage criticism of the patriarchy with montraville but she fails to take it . instead , rowson places the blame for charlotte 's ruin on the women within the novel . when charlotte leaves the safe bosom of her morally upstanding family , she enters into the deviant world of the female who fail to protect her from licentious men . madame du pont errs in judgment by hiring the morally loose miss la rue . madame du pont sets charlotte 's downfall in action . rowson does not punish the ignorant madame du pont by killing her , she ends up an hysterical mess after the montraville/charlotte `` elopement . '' miss la rue , the woman who pushes charlotte into the arms of montraville , must be punished for being a promiscuous woman . she ends up poor and begs for her last scrap of food . she ends up dying painfully as rowson takes the opportunity to lecture her readers on the improper behavior of loose women . why would modern readers want to read this ? i do not think any intelligent would reader would want to subject themselves to the depressing experience of reading this novel . at 125 pages , it seemed to progress at such an excruciating pace . no character has any shadings . there are no subplots to divert the attention from the static charlotte . rowson does nothing to keep our interest . unfortunately rowson has become a heroine to feminist scholars for her feat as the first american woman to have a best-selling novel . that accomplishment is noteworthy as literary trivia , but it does not make for engaging reading
1	today , i heard sister prejean speak about her book dead man walking and about all of the experiances that shes been through concerning the death penalty . nothing less than amazing . dead man walking calls upon the unjustices in the death penalty but also on the actual death penalty victims . many people think that death penalty victims are just plain bad people . read this book . if you want to be challenged on your views , read this book . you ca n't be idle on the death penalty . also , coming soon is the death of innocence . sister prejean spoke on the content of this book and the stories within it . once again , nothing less than amazing . a story that is priceless to hear and will influence your life
1	*** refers to cd recording **** after picking up and putting down the book countless times i finally listened to this on cd . the time and attention i did n't have for the print version came easily for the audio recording . guiness is an engaging and enthusisatic speaker in full command of his subject matter . he draws on foundational christian truths , historic and contemporary references , anecdotes , and a solid business acumen . he routinely distinguishes between what something is and is not ( eg ; vocation , calling , surrender ) in unequivocal terms . also , he consistently makes the point that the main reason for our existence is to glorify god ; everything else in his presentation simply ties-back to this truth . he explains how we get distracted , how others have , and how we can correct our path , again providing examples . and unlike the christianity lite trend in america that often promotes wealth without work or responsibility , guinness is explicit about the sacrifice inherent in a christian life , using for example the lives of leonidas , st. francis , and bonhoeffer . he also speaks of the joys of a truly god-centered life . i recommend the call to anyone who is listening for their own call . it will help you distinguish between a calling and wish-fulfillment/fantasy , acquaint you with others who have heard their call , and inspire you to act . if you 've already heard and responded to your call , you 'll recognize guinness as a fellow traveler . this 3-hour presentation was taped live at highland park presbyterian church in dallas , tx usa . the recording includes 3 audience q sessions of about 10 minutes each . these were as informative as the main presentation , often reflecting the very questions i had while listening . recording was produced by wpublishinggroup.com in nashville , tn usa
0	i was a philosophy major in college and i hated this book . but then again , the whole nambla fic genre really does n't do it for me . i 'm sure some literary aesthetes are going to pick this review apart , good for them . i 'm incredibly well-read and thought this one was just a tepid bore . save your time , read some dostoevsky , some dickens , some milton , ( ... )
0	this bok was very boring i found it hard to stay awa
1	i expected a fabbo edge-of-the-seat read . what i did n't expect was that this pomo thriller would provide a passel of top-flight management secrets to its unsuspecting readers . from the opening pages of the book , as wylie jones prepares to depart on a `` business trip '' of unspecified duration , to the penultimate chapter , when a revitalized wylie and his attentive amanuensis wrap up a deal on the left coast , this beach-bag zinger is chock full with the sorts of advice , hints , tips , and warnings that help to build healthy management brains in twelve ways ! think of it as a kind of business allegory . wylie 's cross-country odyssey is what might happen if robert fulghum were to meet john gardner trundling down the road on his reality bike , set fire to robertson davies ' beard , and then move on over to the highway hacienda for corn dogs and a brew with none other than warren buffet , everyone 's favorite grassroots investor . i totally loved it . it gets my absolute highest rating
1	as someone who was arrested amd jailed and deported from japan due to a fear of flying phobia that the japanese government refused or could not comprehend , i find dupont 's book an important addition to helping the public understand and deal with such phobias . i still do n't like to fly , even after my 1983 accident , but dupont 's book helped me better understand my condition . a very important book . i hope it finds a japanese publisher , too
1	i was introduced to this book while staying with a friend , and i was hooked . i went home and bought it so that i could finish it . i did n't know much about buddhism before i read this book . ms. boorstein 's stories read a bit like the chicken soup for the soul books . she has short wonderful stories that demonstate current day people practicing the buddha 's teachings . you do not need to be a buddhist to appreciate this book ! it 's very inspirational . since this book , i have read several more books to learn about the teachings of buddha
0	eliot cohen has an impressive background in policy work ( osd ) and academia ( naval war college and harvard ) . i had high hopes for this book because i thought his experience with the military combined with his academic work would produce a focused and well-grounded work . i was disappointed . i never really bought his argument that political leaders can lead war better than generals . he seemed to cherry pick leaders than fit his mold . i could not believe that someone who works so closely with the military would generalize military leadership in such a stereotypical way . the article might have made a good article in a foreign affairs journal , but the author seemed to fill out the book with a lot of interesting but not really relevant historical stories and facts . the lincoln chapter providing nothing that has not been stated numerous times in more detailed and focused work . the churchill chapter was the best . cohen obviously has extensively studied churchill . his sections on how the historical view of churchill have ebbed and flowed over the years was well done , thought not rally tied to the focus of the book . i learned the most from the ben-gurion , since i knew the least about him . the book may be useful to an undergraduate class studying political leadership or foreign policy , but beyond that the book unfortunately offers little that is new or of great interest .
1	this book is the equivalent of the proustian madeleine ... to read it is to recover a past long lost . making the case for the mordant paradigm shift of us morals , ethics and literary tastes , this is the marker past which one can see the sad decline of the quality of art and life in the modern world . i can not improve on the highly intelligent and sensitive overview given here by reviewer big orange `` paxbear '' and so will not review the book in detail . that it is one of only three saroyan volumes still in print makes the case for the obsolesence of the clear heart and clear mind in today 's mindlessly kinetic world . you can read this book in the time it would take you to go see mi 111 in a cineplex . carpe diem . read this instead
0	a great resource for first time and experienced importers who do not fully understand their responsibilites as an importer .
0	the author of this book , warren wagar , is apparently a professor of `` future studies . '' i certainly hope he has long been fired from that post . `` a short history of the future '' was written in 1989 , but the writer is so ignorant of politics , and so wrong , to be blunt , it reads as if it was written in the 1940 's . orwell 's 1984 is more on the mark than this . he shows barely any creativity in his `` predictions '' and clearly was barely even aware of much of the contemporary political developments of his time . the fact that he assumes the soviet union will continue plodding along well into the 21st century is incredibly naive . the fact that he assumes the nation 's socialist economy system would survive equally long is similarly bizarre . did he read the newspapers ? did he pay any attention to that gorbachev fellow and the path he was bringing russia down ? and honestly , did anyone really expect that germany would remain divided into two states until time immortal ? or that latin america and africa would remain dictatorships forever ? or that black rule in south africa would not occur until 2014 ? if this book had been written 30 or 40 ago , it would be excusable . this book is just sloppy . he does n't even do a good job describing how his corporations take over the world . everything is just described in these overly flowery sweeping generalizations . like `` and then the capital lords seized control of the governments and made the state wither like an autumn rose . '' that sort of thing . the author is clearly an `` ivory tower '' academic who believes history can be predicted sorely through dry marxist theory and analyzing dubious vague `` trends . '' the fact that this book became horribly dated something like three years after it was published is quite a strong indictment of a man whose entire job was devoted to predicting the future .
0	someone gave me this book as a gift -- why , i have no idea . this book is about as intelligent as a tv sitcom , about as funny as a tv sitcom , and generally at the level of a tv sitcom . i found it neither funny , inspiring nor interesting . it is , in the final analysis , proof that any book that purports to be about `` strong '' or `` outrageous '' women will immediately sell thousands of copies , regardless of the piffle between the covers , and is thus a triumph of marketing over everything . probably best for teenaged girls who do n't read much . it 's no worse than tv , i guess
0	you get your money 's worth here -- there are a ton of cds in this audio book . unfortunately , i found bryson 's prose ( which i enjoyed a lot when reading silently , as i have done with his other books ) to be greatly irritating when spoken aloud . to me , he sounds kind of 'affected ' in parts , and sometimes there is a sort of `` moist '' sound when he pronounces words . hard to describe until you hear the cd , but trust me on this one . i think a lot of the positive reviews on here are for the book , and not the cd . i would stick with the written word on this one .
0	i 'm trying to figure out what the appropriate subtitle for this book should be and i ca n't decide among the following : * travels through guilt with the world 's 33rd richest hippie * the mind of an empty suit * a self-important revisionist history * how i learned to hate myself and love the third world * memoirs of a cold war paperpusher confessions of an economic hitman by john perkins is an exclamation point riddled history of a few financial manipulations of the cold war by a man who had no stake in his own ambition . the first thing you notice about this account is that it is written by a man who thinks he was sitting on top of the world , when in fact he was just a cog in the energy industry . if you are credulous enough to believe that the debts and revenues associated with the energy business is indeed the core principle of the global economy , then the moral outrage of this book makes sense . but there 's a whole lot to swallow . on the plus side , it 's a fast and somewhat entertaining read . otherwise it is a exercise in the slow revelations of a kind of self-loathing that takes about 20 years to surface . one of the things that i 've had in mind as i was reading this screed was the sense of geography as destiny . as i look at the 20th century , i think of most of it focused on the economics of . perkins was one of the people who made the truth a narrative of economic exploitation . he falls in love with socialist charismatics in latin america , rues the lives of poor peasants , and bemoans the basic nature of corporate capitalism without ever acknowledging or even understanding the basic nature of socialism . perkins is a perfect example of a cultural relativist . a perceptive reader can see how much he hates his hometown and parents and idolizes romantic ideals associated with revolutionary rhetoric . but you ca n't imagine that he even had the temerity to read marx , weber , engles , friere or anyone . back when i was a bit more blackified , i referred to such people as culture vultures . if it 's indigenous , it 's good . but you 'll never see him once talk about infant mortality statistics , literacy rates , crime rates or even inflation . i discovered a bit too late that this book would teach me nothing about the business of foreign direct investment or the workings of the world bank except that he saw it as evil . technically , you 'll get a great deal more insight reading wikipedia . basically , perkins assumes that his game was the only game on the planet , his company was smack dab in the middle of it and that it was all being subtley directed by the cia and nsa and that this is , was and always will be the american way . you really get a foggy view of the evil empire of america from perkins , who resembles nobody quite so much as a cynical wanker who is too soulless to quit the game . it 's a confession all right . by the time i got 2/3rds of the way through , reading the book began to become annoying . the incredible vacuity of this man was staggering . there are no personal relationships in the book worth speaking of . he found loyalty only to his bosses worth mentioning . it is a stunning revelation about his character that he never once had a kind word to say or any personal quality worth mentioning about his staff that stands out in memory . we learn that he took one of his charges ( female ) on a yacht cruise to some isle in the caribbean , but that when he got there , he was so sickened by his guilty conscience that he banged his head against the coconut trees . if you want to understand something about the life of an economist and high finance , the best book i 've read is my life as a quant . if you want to understand something about the life of a reluctant spy , the best book to read is larry kolb 's overworld . if you want to get well-written account of a man who was too spoiled to find himself while being a toady in the economic hardball of the cold war era , then this is your book . but it 's nowhere near as good as , say the quiet american . you can imagine that perkins , who is a great admirer of graham greene , might have had aspirations to be such a character as greene might pen . he is earnest to tell such a story that would portray himself thus , but he is to honest to consider himself heroic , and i suspect that he 'll be working off his guilt for the rest of his life . in that regard , 'confessions of an economic hitman ' is ( now prefaced and extended in the paperback edition ) a blueprint for american liberal guilt . if there was ever someone who truly believed that global warming and a host of other blowbacks are destined to doom america to a well-deserved kharmic smackdown , it is john perkins . he has always been a citizen of the world pretending to be a patriotic american , down to the repetitions of his undying faith in the words of thomas paine . you 'd think , being a pseudo-economist , that he 'd have some room in his heart for alexander hamilton . ahh but that would mean that he 'd have to admire courage . i did n't want to be a harsh judge of perkins . i thought i might learn of an extraordinary life , one of conviction and then epiphany . instead i learned of a small yapping dog who was always on a leash he lacked the spirit to gnaw through . someone who would tell us in the end that we should use less oil and that 'corporatocray ' is evil . this book has been a disappointment in many ways . i may well be very happy to read thomas friedman after this . good parts ? yeah there are a few . he speaks about a few south american presidents who might have been contenders . he gives a few details about saudi aramco . but compared to larry kolb 's fascinating and detailed portraits of daniel ortega and adnan khashoggi , this is romper room . if perkins thought he was an agent ... do n't make me laugh

0	i found this book at a thrift store for 25 cents . i flipped though it and it looked dated , but interesting , so i decided to get it . as other reviewers mention , it is dated -- but you got ta know that up front when you get it . it 's published in 1986 , when there were no ( well , almost no ) home computers . so you have to accept up front that it 's talking about organizing papers using more papers -- but that 's something we still all got to do occasionally . so it 's a system of notepads , file folders , etc . it does help you try to understand why you want to keep papers , etc , and what you can do about it . however , it does get overly complex , and really does n't seem applicable in today 's world , where there are far fewer `` homemakers '' who spend time organizing sewing and recipe files , as this book seems to be focused on . finally , i have to mention that it was the continual religion-related references that put me off to the book in the end . others who are comfortable with this may not even notice it , but for me , i felt i was being preached to a bit too much to find it tolerable . just my personal taste ; i 'm sure some others will disagree with this judgement , but i have to admit after enough casual religion references tossed randomly throughout the text , i gave up on the book and put it in the recycle bin
0	i have no personal experience with 12-step programs nor do i have dominant addictions ( other than book and dvd buying ! ) but i am a psychologist who has seen a lot of people and their stories and regularly deals with smoking , over-eating and love addictions in particular . i was hoping for some new ideas to assist clients . this book takes a rational-emotive type approach to conquering addiction and on that level is fine for those wanting to look at that approach . i also found some of his reference to research of how people recover also quite useful but he seems to have quite a personal , and often over-generalised , attacking crusade against 12-step programs . some of his concerns about possible problems and misunderstandings many people can have with 12-step programs were valid and useful . similarly i welcomed his questioning of the disease model that has people always defining themselves as an addict and powerless . however he has to keep coming back in every chapter to go over and over the evils he sees in 12-step programs - and in very derogatory judgmental language . he often even implies they are all deliberately manipulating and exploiting people . i got very uncomfortable with his imputing these motives to everyone . there appear to be many genuine people of good intention in these movements ( and many who clearly seems to get a lot out of them and have recovered ) . i would have rather he had used his own rational methods rather than resort to such abusive language . he could have suggested modified views and tools , and alternatives to consider . i ca n't imagine that he would lure anyone away from the 12-step programs he criticises by attacking everything they have been standing for . however a gentler exploration of limitations and evidence and suggestions for alternatives may have opened up a welcomed middle ground
0	bestseller -stupid plot -horrible plot -dumb characters i have one conculsion matthew reilly was trying to buy up all the copies of this book to save himself from embrassmen
1	i ordered several of these for gifts for my family . it is one of the `` forever '' books to keep for the rest of your life .
1	i have n't completed the book yet , but so far have found it to be very insightful and enjoyable . it begins in genesis and continues from there hitting on the most commonly read bible sections to the not so often or seldom read sections . he ends everyday with a thought provoking question to think on through out the rest of your day . i always look for to the next reading
0	i have read several of hiaasen 's books and loved them . they were very funny . this one is not . it is an endless description of naked strippers . i found the main character , erin , to be very unappealing . she is just so stupid . her problems are all of her own creation . and she is not funny . i think you have to be a man to like this book . i , as a woman , just found it exceedingly boring . i kept waiting for it to get funny . it never did
0	i have loved many of jodi picoult 's other books , but this one seemed too far-fetched . i did not feel the evil depicted in the comic book drawings was necesary to the storyline and in-fact detracted from it . many of my friends who are jodi fans were also disappointed in this newest release
1	a well-crafted comprehensive look at the role of islam in turkey . the book offers some original and compelling explanations regarding the social transformation that turkey has experienced since the 1980s . specifically , the author mentions the role of opportunity spaces in the evolution of islamic movements and ideas as a result of economic and political liberalization.i think anyone who is interested in turkey , islamic movements , and the relationship between islam and modernity would get a great deal out of this book
0	unless you are interested in reading one chapter after another plugging bear spray , do n't waste your time . the stories are all re-hashed versions of nearly identical situations ; man goes into the wilderness-man sees bear-man uses udap bear spray on bear-bear retreats . this book is one long advertisement for udap ! ! my book was actually misprinted , missing 50 pages right in the middle . initially i wanted to return my book for a complete one but , after reading the rest of 223 pages , i did n't want to waste any more of my time with this one story
0	after reading the delightful charlie and the chocolate factory , this sequel was an absolute let-down . the novel begins with the great glass elevator breaking through the ceiling of charlie 's ( formerly wonka 's ) chocolate factory and rocketing into orbit around the earth . while beyond the reaches of earth 's atmosphere , our heroes -- -charlie , grandpa joe , and mr. wonka -- -must deal with the malleable and voracious vermicious knids ( pronounced `` k'nids '' ) , aliens which resemble unfrighteningly hostile figs or turds with eyes . far worse than these beasties , though , are the insufferable old folks whose twenty-year stint in their shared bed has made them less than useless . charlie , joe , and wonka , with no help from charlie 's folks or other grandparents , save themselves and a us spacecraft from the clutches of the knids and return to the chocolate factory , where the old timers stupidly overdose on youth pills , returning them to infancy or beyond . charlie and wonka race around trying to help these ancient parasites , who respond to this assistance with the thanklessness the reader comes to expect from these oldsters . at the end of the novel , the geriatric brigade finally leaves the bed when they have a chance to meet the president . in short , these three are the most tedious , spiteful , unredeemable characters i 've come across in children 's literature and i hoped that they would be eaten by the knids or the gnoolies or even the oompa-loompas as i read this book . as it is , they ( unlike the awful kids in the chocolate factory ) learn no lessons and persist in their curmudgeonly parasitism from the first page to the last . their presence throughout the novel rendered it a chore , rather than a joy , to read .
1	to learn some italian before visiting italy , i tried multiple language-learning programs borrowed from my local library . some were ridiculous , many required using a workbook . then i stumbled on the pimsleur program , which is totally audio , allowing me to learn italian while i drove to and from work . due to the pedagogically- sound method pimsleur developed for language learning , i actually did learn some basic italian . as a result i bought `` conversational italian . '' though i 've never considered myself adept at language-learning , i actually felt confident in my ablility to learn italian as a result of these cds . i 've raved about them to friends who have expressed interest in learning a language
0	if you are looking for a `` feel good '' book about baby boomer retirement , this book may have some value for you . but if you are looking for specific in-depth how-to , this book is n't the answer . each segment-work , dreams , travel-is short and does n't address many relevant issues . for example , regarding the work chapter , the author postulates that there will be a work shortage and companies will hire baby boomers to fill the gap . well , that is speculative with globalism . those jobs may be outsourced . most are low paying . many of my highly qualified friends are unable to find jobs despite retraining . yes , there may be wal-mart jobs but is this your retirement dream ? the work chapter sounds a lot like most `` do what you love '' books . but doing what you love is often best as a hobby not to furnish needed income . these and other issues facing boomers who want meaningful work into their 70s are not addressed . i could pick apart other chapters in the same manner
0	i bought this book and was sorely disappointed . nothing specific . just lots of references to self analyzation to see what you think you want to do . you could do this yourself without a book
0	i found this book vacuous and jejune . and frankly , i met the author ( without knowing who he was ) and he tried to pick me up , and i 've never heard such a pile of cr.. in my life . and i 'm not even close to beautiful . so good luck with his advise
0	the book appears to give comprehensive coverage in terms of the number and type of entries included . however , on the atkins diet , the important measure to monitor is the `` active '' carbohydrate mass which may metabolised and which excludes roughage or fiber . the inclusion of such a measure in the book would greatly enhance its value and utility
0	need i say more than the above title suggests ? okay , so the upside of this book is that it has important life lessons and epiphanies from the voice of experience . there are some touching moments in this book , but even then there is still something the author is lacking . i saw the movie when it was in theatres and i have just finished reading the book . i liked the movie soooooooooo much better than the book . the movie was funny , entertaining , touching , personal , and sad at times . the book did not captivate me at all . i had trouble staying focused . considering beverly donofrio 's credentials -- a bachelor 's degree in english from wesleyan university and a master of fine arts in creative writing -- her quality of writing is very poor . her quality of writing is more like someone who has only a highschool education , if even that . and not to go off topic , but since donofrio has a master of fine arts in creative writing from a top notch school like columbia u , then why does n't she write about something else besides her getting pregnant in highschool and how that has changed her life ? i mean , after all , the mfa is in creative writing , meaning she should be more creative rather than just write autobiographies all the time . she has only wrote 2 books -- riding in cars with boys , and looking for mary , both about her getting pregnant at a young age . if you liked the movie , just leave it at that . do n't bother reading the book unless you enjoy getting disappointed . and if you 're interested in a novel or autobiography about teen pregnancy , then go to the local library . do n't get this one . there 's other novels covering the same subject that are far superior to this one .
0	k , besides the late arrival , the whole book was written in terminology in which i had to read over and over again before i understood the meaning . its not like the book came with appendices right ? anyway , i do not know whats the huu haa about the book . it seems pretty fictional . coming from a muslim
1	it 's a beu
1	hard to figure why sean stewart is n't one of the most beloved writers in america , given the virtuoso performance he 's demonstrated here and the remarkably sympathetic character he 's created in will kennedy . a combination horror/fantasy work which is as reminiscent of a confederacy of dunces as it is ghosts , by hynd , this novel is filled with so much warmth and life that it 's hard to remember that this actually is a story about a man who understands that the past , too , can be a ghost , and perhaps the worst kind . perfect circle is everything every other supposed 5-star horror novel featured on amazon is supposed to be : well-written , compelling , with rich , empathetic characters and a driving force and tension all its own . it 's a wonderful introduction to mr. stewart 's work
1	elaine pagels is a wonderful writer . her explanation into early christianity is wonderful . it is definitely worth the time to read this . she delves into the politics of the early church , the passion , the resurrection , as well as the clashes between gnostic and orthodox thinking . too often , we forget that what we call the canon is not the only writings available . she just reminds us that there is this whole other world of writings that did not make it into the bible for one reason or another . if you want to get an idea of who the gnostics were , read this
1	the subject provided a good historical perspective on japan 's renaissance period , post civil wars and pre-westernization . in many respects musashi , a ronin represents japan 's search for an identity , a country ruled by military might in the form of the shogun , yet keeping an emperor who they revered as a god , a god without power . this sword saint was a man of great prowess with a sword of wood or of steel ; he was also an artist , a lithographer and an author . yet , he was masterless , masterless in a time when righteous was measured in a retainer 's devotion to his master . he was his own master , in a time when japan had no voice , serving all , without righteous . it would take an other two hundred and fifty years or so and a world war to release the spirit of the samurai , that being honor amongst personal sacrifice a picture painted in the person of miyamoto musashi struggle for perfection and personal mastery of his profession , master of the sword
0	i personally do not see how this book could have won a newbery medal . while the author portrays sibling rivalry effectively , that is about the only positive aspect of this book . the fact that the teenage girl protagonist has a crush on an elderly man is disgusting and is presented as not only being acceptable but understandable . sara 's family is also unsupportive to her sulky and jealous attitudes . her grandmother is a busybody and consantly antagonizes the family . sara 's twin sister gets all the attention and love , leaving sara starving for parental care . finally , christianity is portrayed as harsh and judgemental . this book could possibly be acceptable for adults but never for children and i would not recommend it to anyone . i wasted my time with this book : please do n't waste yours .
1	the miernik dossier was shockingly good . before this , i had never read anything by mccarry . in fact , i had never even heard the man 's name . i was lucky to come across a review of this re-issued work in a magazine . now i am collecting everything by him . the story follows an odd assortment of people , some of whom may or may not be intelligence agents , as they travel south through europe into africa . for the entire length of the book you will be wondering and guessing and probably changing your mind many times as to who is working against whom and trying to figure out if miernik is who he says he is . the writers of the dossier themselves seem to be unsure . in that sense the miernik dossier has similar elements to a mystery or detective novel , but yet it goes way beyond that . it is also a highly compelling character study , with each of the group drawn intricately by the author so that you come to know the characters . this makes it all the more suspenseful because these people who you seem to know or possibly identify with in some way may very well not be who you think they are . the miernik dossier is a highly entertaining read . true spy literature , in the vein of ashenden , that is enjoyable for those who enjoy spy stories , mysteries or simply great writing . i can not wait to read this book again
0	this book is awful . i have read the entire thing , and it says nothing that is useful . i have been in public accounting for 10 years , and i am now ready to start my own firm . i wasted my money on buying this book . i know it is tempting to buy , since the title is exactly what i was looking for , but trust me , choose another book . the accounting guild website that the author constantly refers to is no longer in existence
0	though this book does present all the necessary information for learning about abnormal psychology , it 's the dryest , most aesthetically difficult to read textbook ... especially if you happen to be studying the material online/through independent study . the publisher needs to redesign the book and/or you need to have a better online course professor . it feels nearly impossible to be interested in this material ( which is interesting in itself ) if you have to read the textbook front to back on your own without any instruction .
0	i actually know where trieste was before i read this book . unfortunately i have never visited the city . i wanted to read this travel book about this famous city , but after a few chapters , i wondered where the book was going to . after the final chapter , i still do not know what the author 's intentions was with this book . perhaps i do n't read too many travel books . obviously the city means a lot to the author , but she did not express it clearly in her writing . i was scratching my head at the end , and wondering what i read . i learned a little about the city , but not in relation to the amount of time i spent reading this short book . the city of james joyce and maximillian . the imperial port of the austo-hungarian empire . the meeting point of slav , german , and latin empires . one of the ending points of the iron curtain . this city breeds interest and yet the author took us on a round about journal that confuses the reader . i am sure the author 's other books are good , her last one was not the greatest .
1	mill states here that he still believes traditional gender roles ( as we now call them ) are desirable , but , being john mill , he passionatly believes in the freedom of lifestyle choice for the individual . hard to argue with that
1	i served in the army myself and although i have n't expirienced war myself i expirienced a lot during my service in the idf . this book takes you inside the heads and lives of the grunts who went through the hell of vietnam . the figures changes during the story and you learn more and more of them , feeling like you are walking in the jungles by them . someone told me this was a `` hard book to read '' and i did n't know what he 'd meant until i finished it . this is one of my favorite books and almost the only one i 've read more than once . a must for anyone interested in the vietnam war
0	i finished it because a friend recommended it , but had she not , i would have quit after page 20 . i was n't interested in the story or writing . i did n't find the story grotesque ; i 've read a lot worse dealing with the various topics in this book , but i just did n't find the protagonist very interesting . he went a bit nutty at the end and it is understandable given the situation . we learn about why he had to stick so tenaciously to his religious beliefs , to redeem himself . his actions did n't seem out of line , either during the war or during the plague , given his dire predicament and previous behaviors and experiences . i know this is a great example of a book written in second person , and perhaps for that it is worth reading . i would n't pick it up for enjoyment or leisure
1	i really enjoyed this book , it was n't completely comprehensive but did give a good overview of buffet 's investment style . while it did n't go heavily into the analysis of stocks that i would have liked it did describe who influenced buffet , thanks to this book i was able to pick up some fisher and graham and have learned quite a bit . all in all i would reccomend this book for someone interested in a light biography of buffet or a little insight into how he makes decisions
1	`` the great locomotive chase '' is the stuff of legend . this somewhat obscure event , which commemorated the first anniversary of the first shots on fort sumter , could too easily be written off among civil war devotees as a lark , a foolhardy distraction from the inexorable march from shiloh to the seven days , to second manassas , to the three more years of bloodletting that were required in order to form a more perfect union . but first-time author russell bonds does a masterful job of taking this adventure story on its own terms , telling it well , and placing it in its proper context . the raid itself is a gripping story of intrigue , espionage , and derring-do . and if mr. bonds had only told the tale itself , this book would be well worth the read . but what sets this distinguished this book apart from so much civil war writing is mr. bonds 's ability to tell this gripping tale objectively , while putting it in its proper context . the author sets the table with a relatively brief yet thorough overview of the strategic arrangement of the war nine months after first manassas . and by doing so , and by explaining why the raid , coupled with the deep penetration of general ormsby mitchell into tennessee and north alabama , offered the fleeting chance to cut the confederacy in two and thereby hasten the end of the war , mr. bonds gives the otherwise reckless ï¿½lan of the raiders its proper place . andrews and his raiders were not off on a lark , even though students of the era will have the natural reaction , `` what were they thinking ? '' mr. bonds answers that question , and the answer , as incongruous as it may seem , reminds the reader that there was so much more to the great war than the epic battles of the armies of the potomac and northern virginia . if the author had done nothing more than told the story of the great raid , reconciling contemporary accounts that were so often embellished , this would be a wonderful adventure story , in the great tradition of shelby foote 's narrative history of the war . but this book does so much more . it puts the raid in its proper strategic context , and it tells the story of the gallant raiders after the raid itself failed . this book will satisfy both the devoted civil war critic and the general reader who loves a historical tale well-told .
1	it shows the power of god and what he wants to do in our lives if we 'll simply obey him . how many rhees howells has god raised up but because they would n't walk with him , god was n't able to use them . i would say this is a terrifying book because i know this is something that god wants from every believer . let 's walk with jesus and see what he wants to do in our lives . regardless of our age or function in the body of christ , we can all be prayer warriors . will you ( and will i ) be warriors in the prayer closet ? that 's one the important questions that jesus is asking his church in these last days
0	let 's face it -- if you want to get a non-fiction self help type book published and sold today , you better have a completely original idea -- or make it controversial and provacative . i would hope that ms. bennetts ' opinions are written for this purpose since they are so extreme . i am a college educated stay at home mom of two small boys . i am proud to be doing that and to be defering to my husband to support me/us financially in this mutual decision . i feel it 's a personal decision to stay home and try not to be judgemental of others , but to me there is no career worth giving up taking them and picking them up from school everyday , helping in their class , having simple chats after school , and most important being very present in their young lives . does that mean i 'm sitting back fat , dumb and happy , expecting 100 % to live the fairy tale so i can turn stupid and dependent on him for my every need ? of course not . our relationship is solid , his job is as stable as one can be , we have good life insurance and a lot of it . here 's an important one -- we live within our means ! we do n't have two leased cars and a house we ca n't afford . in addition , while i have `` given up '' my career to raise my kids full time , i have a lot of skills , drive , and no doubt that in that worst case scenario i could provide an income when and if i need to . i certainly would hope no one would give up the opportunity to stay home because of these so called realistic fears . look , if you want to be a working mom by choice -- knock yourself out . but do n't look for excuses to justify it to yourself and others by saying you 're doing it in case of the worst . that would be a bigger `` feminine '' mistake
0	a subject of eternal fascination especially for basketball `` nuts '' who grew up in new york . we idolized the terribly tarnished ccny `` wonder five '' who set an unbreakable record by winning both the nit and ncaa titles in 1950 ( it can never be repeated because of the way the tournaments are now scheduled ) . this book is a fictional addendum to rosen 's non-fiction treatment of the original basketball `` scandals '' , as he outlines in his npr interview . unfortunately there are glaring albeit minor errors -- broadway and 43rd street can not be on the east side of manhattan ; madison square garden has been on 23rd street , and is now above penn station ; in between it occupied the block bounded by 49th and 50th streets and eighth and ninth avenues . these errors are particularly galling in a book by a new yorker who played at hunter college , and they undermine the author 's credibility and care in writing . since this is a fictionalized account of a real occurrence , the game of who is this really is inescapable . hence it is most unfortunate that rosen in his interview avers that some players who were not prosecuted went on to pro careers , and `` a couple are in the hall of fame . '' this tarnishes by inclusiveness such stalwarts as bob cousy ( holy cross , '49 ) , dick mcguire ( st. johns , '48 ) , bobby wanzer ( seton hall , '46 ) , and frank mcguire , the legendary coach at st. john 's , north carolina and south carolina
0	it takes indeed some real power to get so many five-star reviews for such shallow writing . this book is a very poor way of handling thw well-known concept of paradigms and paradigm shifts . if you are at all familiar with these concepts simply forget buying this book as ( just because you paid money for it ) you will naturally be inclined to read it and this will be a total waste of time and energy . there are so many books on creativity , innovative thinking and innovation ; look for them . this is a book on nothing : was it a busines book on business models ? was it a cookbook for personal development ? what was this for god 's sake , apart from being an insult on iltelligence
1	time to pack up my luggage ( would n't it be nice to have a suitcase like rincewind 's ? ) and take off for discworld while the rain and gloom of a january thaw engulf the northern hemisphere . `` guards ! guards ! '' is the eighth book in the discworld series , in which captain sam vimes of ankh-morpork 's night watch gives up drinking and gets married ( just the opposite of most folks ) . i do n't read the discworld novels in order any more , just pick up a favorite and start in . the blurbs on the back and cover pages compare pratchett to charles dickens ( pratchett is better ) , chaucer , `` j.r.r . tolkien with a sharper , more satiric edge , '' and p.g . wodehouse . i think any author who garners comparisons with such wildly disparate writers must be in a category by himself . heck , pratchett is a category by himself . so on to ankh-morpork where the unique and supreme lodge of the elucidated brethren decides , with a little prompting from its supreme grand master , to conjure up a dragon . the dragon will cause enough death and property damage ( including a vegetable stand and a brother-in-law 's shiny new carriage ) so that when the supreme grand master 's nephew rides into the city with his sharp , shiny sword and slays the beast , the grateful citizens will proclaim him king . this plot works rather well , except that the dragon decides that it wants to be king and cremates its would-be slayer . its requirements are simple and traditional : one well-bred virgin per month , and all of the gold , silver , and jewels in ankh-morpork for its hoard . the new regime fires sam vimes from his job as captain of the night watch . how he wonders , could things get worse ? well , at least he 's not a virgin and no one is talking to him in capital letters .
1	this book is a quick read and a great introduction to artificial life . it combines something of the science , the personalities and the history of this field . for general readers with some technical sophistication it affords an opportunity to broaden one 's horizons without too much of a mathematical stretch ; for computer scientists who are thinking of their own research it can give a general idea of some of the accomplishments in the field and a place to start delving into the original research papers . read it and enjoy the future
0	this book was a huge disappointment . not only was n't it funny to me , it has absolutely nothing funny for kids . too bad its not worth the return shipping charges . i threw it out
0	no doubt about it . this book covers the history of the border patrol . however , it falls far short of what it ostensibly bills itself and ends up more as a `` fluff piece '' than anything else . as someone who has not only served as a senior border patrol agent ( 13 years ) but also a border patrol union president and outspoken critic of the agency , i have studied this agency inside and out without the affects of tunnel vision that typically accompany the job ( many say a necessity ) . pacheco , as an active agent ( when he wrote the book at least ) , appears headed in the right direction with the book and then suddenly veers off target . his somewhat ambiguous message that border security is a difficult task is obviously an attempt to straddle the line ( i apologize for the pun ) so as not to appear too contentious or controversial . did he need to seek agency approval for publication since he was actively employed ? if so , then the credibility issue leaps out and the book is worth the historical content alone if nothing else . if he did not need agency approval and was truly writing without restraint , then he failed to accurately convey the real state of the border patrol and border security . simply put , the border patrol , as with most of the homeland security subcomponents is disintegrating . remember the incompetence of fema ( a homeland security subcomponent ) ? well , multiply that incompetence times ten . heard about the poor morale of fema employees ? multiply that problem by one-hundred and you have an accurate picture of the border patrol . a border patrol in which the vast majority of otherwise employable agents spend ninety-percent of their time trying to get out . those that choose to stay in do so only because of the comparatively worse off agencies in dhs . the bottom line is that as a former agent , i lose sleep at night knowing what i know . pacheco did cover the rigorous training regimen accurately even if it bordered on propaganda . that alone may attract candidates to the difficult and completely unrewarding position of u.s. border patrol agent . the field stories are completely unappealing to anyone who served more than a week in a law enforcement position unless they are reading about their own exploits . read the book for enjoyment and homage . just do n't expect critical analysis . in fact , this book would be an enjoyable read at stewarts bridge ( for you ib agents in san diego ) .
0	as a certified information systems security professional , i can definitively state that this book does not cover everything that needs to be covered or in any depth whatsoever . i got this book based on the glowing reviews i found here , and i 'm at a loss as to why these reviews would have recommended it . the most aggrevating part about this book is the subtitle `` an integrated approach to security in the organization . '' the book not only lacks effective security integration techniques , it does n't seem to address the entire organization where it tries its half-hearted integration .
0	this series is a travesty . i understand the feeling of loss when you finish a beloved series , but let laura , not macbride , have the last word on her family 's experience . so much in his books rings false : the clumsy historical allusions , the narrative voice , the potty humor . . . one of the greatest things about laura ingalls wilder 's work is the way her voice advances in maturity as she , the main character , grows : big woods is written for little girls and happy golden years for young women . macbride does n't manage this and talks down to readers . there is a tiny thread of laura in these books , but not enough to do more than frustrate her fans . sampling is for rap , not fiction .
1	as mentioned , this book is amazingly compact , cramming three semesters of calculus and a bit of ordinary differential equations into just 800 pages . that conciseness also implies that much explanatory material and many illustrative examples are missing . the authors mention in the preface that `` classifiers of calculus books would call this a traditional book . most theorems are proved or left as exercises to prove ... '' nearly every result in this book has an accompanying proof . for those with a serious interest in mathematics , this is a useful resource . for most others , the presence of so many proofs can be overwhelming and probably is a turnoff . included with the book is a one-page detachable reference card containing a massive amount of valuable information , including common rules for derivatives and integrals , geometric formulas , a few conversion factors , trigonometric identities and graphs ( very useful ! ) , and more . the book also has a three-page comprehensive table of integrals in the inside back cover and a listing of geometric formulas in the front , along with a commemorative timeline and portraits featuring the deceased european males who made calculus possible . given all of this , i would highly recommend this book as an 800-page calculus reference text , or maybe as a text in an honors calculus sequence that expects to use the text throughout multiple semesters - then using it saves you money . but for those who do n't have a super-strong background or interest in math , those who are just taking calculus for a requirement or those who have never seen calculus before , or for those who are just plain math-phobic - using this book just does n't make any sense . i would n't recommend it . for those who are stuck with this book for a course , i 'd suggest looking for another book to help you out . one possible book has already been mentioned in another review : silvanus thompson and martin gardner 's `` calculus made easy '' , a book that dates back originally to 1910 ( ! ) . i 've read parts of it , and the book looks good to me . i 'm sure that there are many other helpful books ; try checking your local/university library or looking on amazon for ideas . an extra calculus textbook that 's more student-friendly might be a good idea . as for the pages falling out , i have n't had a problem with it ( i have the 8th edition ) , but i do n't use the book all that much . i have n't found any serious errors in the text , but i have n't read everything thoroughly , having only used the text for calc iii . and , yeah , getting the student solutions manual would probably be a good idea
0	blind items has the same writing style as at least one of rettenmund 's other books ( boy culture ) . he goes on for pages and pages to describe something that could have been said in two paragraphs . kind of reminds me of the articles you read in the sunday magazine section of your newspaper . if you like this writing style , rettenmund 's books may be for you . personally it drove me crazy and i set the book down after the first few chapters
0	i love heinlein . i think that he has a unique voice and perspective in the world of science fiction . i find that his plots and ideas are inventive . even this story was inventive in many ways , like some of the business ideas in regards to the new source of energy in the first chapters . however , i found this book as a whole to be very boring . much of this is due to the lack of fully fleshed characters . the `` main '' characters of each section of the book are n't fully realized at all . i would n't recommend this book unless you picked it up for free and were really , really bored
1	i assume the plot of this famous tale is well known , so i wo n't spend time on it , but in recently re-reading this book for the first time since ninth-grade english class in the '90 's , i was repeatedly struck by a piercing question : how exactly over time does drama become melodrama ? will our cherished novels seem melodramatic to readers a hundred-forty years hence ? how does this happen , and is there ever an end-point to it ? dickens was by any standard a literary master , and if typifying one 's age is a virtue , then he does this to perfection , yet if failing to achieve a universality unhindered by time ( as other writers have done ) is a limitation , then in this one sense alone charles dickens has an achilles heel
1	what can i say ? more spidey than you can shake a stick at for peanuts . if you ever wished you had the patience to cut out and neatly collect all the sunday paper comics in a nice neat scrap book then this is the book for you . i 'm planning on buying the lot and thoroughly enjoying my strolls down memory lane
0	i was disappointed in this book . the art and techniques illustrated are of the type one might expect to see on a tv craft show . i would instead recomment robert wade 's watercolor book .
0	i did n't know why i chose to read this book . anyway , it was disappointing , really . the book was slow , and it was too long for a story of its type . i mean , i think the book could go on without some of the parts . when i was reading it , i only thought of putting it down because it 's making me go crazy . i thought the plot was shallow , but taylor 's self-conflict was even shallower . he kept on blaming himself about his father 's death well then it 's really his fault ! he was a coward . if you do n't believe me , go on and read about it ... although you might get bored getting to that part because it 's towards the end . and i hated it when this stupid conflict got in the way with his relationship with denise . he was acting really immature ! he should have at least thought about denise but he was too selfish . it really sucked . and yes , i know that this is supposed to be a romance novel ... but i kept on looking for that love factor althroughout the book . and what did i find ? nothing . oh , what a waste . it 's like sparks tried very hard to make the situations in the story seem romantic but as a reader , it did n't really capture the whole essence of what romantic situations should be like . if it had n't been for my hrr ( home reading report ) i would n't have finished reading this at all . i guess i 'm saying this because i 'm not into this genre . love stories are fine but this one ... nah
1	this will be a present for my nephew george 's 37th birthday . he loved curious george as a child , and still does . it 's wonderful how someone carries a love for a childhood toy , book , etc . throughout their life . such an individual eternally has a special spot in their heart kudos to amazon for providing the book for $ 5.00 under market price .
0	in the grand tradition of rational corp - this is an overpriced book from rational corp to complement its overpriced software . i must commend the healthcare example in the book that is described in fair detail . the book 's website is empty and does not supplement the book 's content - only contains a link to order the book and an email to contact the authors . if you have to buy it , buy a used copy or read the free marketing stuff on the rational website
1	i read the book first in its html form , from raymond 's site , and i felt need to buy the real book . its format is very appropriate and shows the best we have in unix . even though i have a degree in chemical engineering , i found it to be a valuable resource for my own projects for open source development
0	ok , i know i 'm going to get hammered for this ; once again , there goes my reviewer rating . but i just have to be honest : this is a terrible story . ok , being that it 's shakespeare , it 's prettily told , but it 's still a horrible story , and i ca n't imagine why otherwise sensible people like it . perhaps they feel that shakespeare is telling it tongue-in-cheek ( it is a comedy , after all ) and poking fun at the system of fathers marrying off their daughters without any concern for whether they want it or not ; that would almost make it tolerable , if i could believe it . but given that it is a shakespearean comedy , we must assume that the ending is supposed to be a `` happy '' one , and the situation at the end is far from pleasant . or perhaps people believe ( i 've heard this claimed in all seriousness ) that kate has actually `` triumphed '' at the end , having figured out how to manipulate petruchio so as to get her way subtly and underhandedly . even if this were true , i 'd hardly consider it a `` happy '' anding , and personally , i see little evidence of it . no , what we actually have here is a story of a strong woman ( some people seem to like it simply because there is a strong woman to be found in it ) being married against her will to a scheming golddigger who `` tames '' her by blatent if indirect spousal abuse ( he does n't beat her , simply starves her and sleep-deprives her , as well as forcing her to wear muddy rags until she behaves exactly as he wants , up to and including winning him a bet by lecturing her contemporaries on their duties as obedient wives . her spirit may or may not be broken , depending on how the part is played , but the fact remains that she 's forced to behave as if it is , and that 's not a message that should be bruited about in a `` comedy '' . this is absolutely the worst of shakespeare 's plays
0	sometimes a reader knows more about a narrow subject than the author . when the author is in error about that subject , the reader may question the accuracy of the descriptions in the rest of the book . such is the case here . i 've written 123 books ; several on parachutes and skydiving . i am a pilot , skydiver and parachute rigger ; i know the sport and the industry . the author wrote : `` we use flat chutes as parasails .

1	i 've read many books on meditation and while each of them answers some of my questions , jack kornfield 's book , a path with heart , answers every one save those that must be experienced first-hand in one 's own time . his voice and advice is articulate , intelligent , humorous , open , patient and wise . he starts out by telling you a little about his own experience , goes on to cover the basics of vipassana meditation and then leads you bit by bit deep into the issues every meditator and spiritual seeker must face . what i love most about his teaching style is that he gives gentle , practical advice on the day-to-day , minute by minute stuff to do to explore , commit to , love being on the path . if my house were on fire and i had to grab only one book on my way out the door , it would be a path with heart
0	i have been slogging through this book for weeks now , it was a terrible shock to the system after john julius norwich 's excellent book on byzantium . the book lacks any narrative thrust , often stopping and retreading events slightly out of chronological order and frequently bringing all forward motion to a halt by describing the intricacies of some bureaucratic office or another . the one consistent thing throughout this book is the author 's obvious agenda to `` set the record straight '' and prove that the ottoman empire was far superior to its `` barbaric '' european contemporaries
1	nine months ago i was hired to help turnaround a once successful business . from day one i realized that this was a company without focus . it 's one thing to define a problem , another to find a solution . haneberg 's book was a shot in the arm . just one concept -- `` stop multitasking '' -- would have been a major breakthrough for my team . and , personally , the idea of doing `` one great thing '' has completely revitalized my approach to a huge job . this book immediately rose to the rank of three or four `` must read '' titles in my business library . in the couple of months since i first read it ( and i 've re-read it a couple of times ) our department has moved far away from the reactive mode that drove decisions -- we 're nailing deadlines , we 're closing more sales , we 're thinking more strategically across the board . in a business and social environment that throws more at us day-by-day , hour-by-hour , this book is even more important than it would have been just a few years ago . we 're all doing more with less -- and this is a book that has helped me see order amid the chaos of conflicting priorities . if it 's true , as woody allen says , that 98 % of success is showing up , then the other 2 % is knowing how to keep your eye on the ball once you get there . this is the manual for getting your business -- and your life -- where you want it to be

0	a little less psycho babble and a bit more logistical information would have suited me better . ms. cantrell spends the majority of the book being a relationship/marriage counselor , and though it 's true issues become larger in smaller spaces , there are more issues for women cruisers than just their relationship dynamics . as i said , practical logistical information would have suited me better .
0	as many have stated before me the book starts off with great promise for people who like historical fiction , however midway it turns into a romance novel . i give it 3 stars for holding my attention . a good beach read that can get you thinking ( a little ) about a time past . the one star is a mistake and i can not seem to change it . 3 *** stars
0	pretentious and boring , too clever for its own good , the only good chapters in this book are the ones about pontius pilate and jesus christ , and there 's not enough of that . and this was the michael glenny translation

1	this is an excellent book . unlike many other tutorials available on internet , it gets you started with some beautiful melodies instead of `` twinkle , twinkle , little star '' . highly recommended !
0	overall , i found this book disappointing . in its defense , its basic thesis of the movement of jewish american orthodoxy towards the `right ' ( more closed and intensely religious ) is interesting , and i am sure accurate , and heilman 's analysis of its evolution is insightful and well-researched . however , i was extremely bothered by the lack of any attempt to portray hareidi society through the prism of its own value system , or in fact any attempt to understand their values at all . heilman accepts his own world view as absolute and obvious to the reader , and in this context denigrates a society with an entirely different set of goals and aspirations . examples of this include his assumption of the primacy of feminism and the worth of secular culture . hareidi society has its own worldview which , although too complex to elaborate on here , has valid and very real reasons for its hierarchy of values , reasons which heilman completely disparages or ignores . ( for an example of a book that is not written by a religious author , yet is able to appreciate hareidim from their own perspective try `` real jews '' by noah efron ) . in general , i found his view of religion as a mere sociological construct ( i.e . a defensive reaction to the holocaust ) to be grossly insensitive to the hareidi intense religious belief founded on thousands of years of tradition . the latter half of the book i found a pathetic attempt to draw conclusions from insignificant pieces of information . for example the juxtaposition of poster a condemning something to a poster advertising b implies that poster a is condemning b as well . or two posters ( put out by the same company ) advertising two different types of music indicates that the community is embattled over the appropriateness of one type of music . in conclusion , although i eagerly awaited this book and found a fraction of it interesting and intelligent , my overall impression is negative due to the authors biased approach and manipulative use of insignificant information .
0	if you are a christian , this book is n't for you . it is full of blashphemy , concluding that we must `` ... forgive god '' and that we must love god `` ... even if he isnt perfect '' . kusher even has the will to say that `` ... god would not be god ... '' without our love for him . at one point he reduces god to an aminal saying that in the garden of eden , when god said `` ... let us make man in our image '' he was speking to animals and creation . kusher explains that god created the world , and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution . since when was god in need of forgiveness ? isnt it that `` ... god so loved the world '' and it wasnt us that loved god ? i have no words in describing this book . it is full of error , because it does not base it self on the gospel of jesus christ . all this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner , and that it isnt your fault , and that actully you are a good person . why do bad things happen to good people ? wrong question . there are no good people in the world in the first place. `` for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god ... '' the world is in sin . the world does not have good people ! ! only by the grace of god , through faith in jesus christ you are made righteous . i beg you in the name of jesus christ to stay away from this book . it hasnt helped 4 million people , but it lied to them . kusher , please turn from your ways and come to jesus , then will you understand the life question `` why ''

1	i picked up the first volumne of these graphic novel series a while ago and i 've been trying to get the whole series ever since ! the concept is new and interesrting and the art is always great . animal farm was especially good because of all the twists in the plot line . nothing is as it seems to be ! take my word .
1	this book has a wealth of information for any practitioner of yoga , from beginner to advanced . the content is concise and practical , and the poses are sequenced in a way that allows for a gradual and safe progression in the practice . there are also dozens of practice sequences given for both improvement and how to treat common ailments through yoga . the introduction is especially valuable , as it offers a no fluff in-depth commentary on the philosophical thought behind the asana practice . i pick it up again and again and am still referring to it after nearly 15 years of owing it . my copy is dog eared and loved , and was well worth every penny . an earlier reviewer mentioned that the photos and layout were not user friendly , and only gave the book two stars , which is a shame . this book was first printed in the mid 1960 's - over 40 years ago ! it was the first yoga book of it 's kind to ever be printed , and it 's content is timeless and as relevant today as ever . mr. iyengar even had to struggle with his then publisher to be allowed to include so many photos , as it was so expensive in those days to print such a book . i say hats off to the man who brought yoga to the west long before it was ready . he 's a pioneer and a virtuoso of his craft , and his marvelous work should never be over overlooked just because it does n't come in some glossy package fit for the masses
0	i was very disapointed in the book.basicly the writer took bits and pieces from books written by others , twisted their words and put his own spin on it.it repeats itself over and over being so repetative i had to put it down.there are good books out there written by people who were there.i suggest you take a look at those.i read many good one 's but this book wasnt in that catagory
0	i was intrigued by the title , which supposedly links jedi wisdom to christianity . well , after 60 pages or so , i have got the feeling that the staub is trying to wrap jedi in christian cloth and failing at that . the author speaks of the difficulty in leading a christian life . but , i say that any religious life ( be it christian , islam or otherwise ) is hard because it turns the back on the norm or the conventional . i am convinced that yoda is a zen master ; the force is derived from tao , not god as interpreted by the orthodox religion ( i am purposefully leaving out christian mysticism , which is another beast altogether. ) . a better book on the subject of theology in star wars is `` the dharma of star wars . ''
0	less a view from afar or broad exposure of solitude from the human condition , this book more aptly excerpts the author 's personal conflicts with human relationships ... ..a one-on-one wrestling match with the self with no spectators and no judges . the book is a good read for academic analysis , but not so fun for venturist philosophy
1	i think halo 2 is more challenging , and its espesialy fun when you invite some buddys to play multyplayer even just 1 on 1 if you get it i would also wait for the multyplayer map pack wich will give you 9 new levels my final word is i hope you enjoy it as much as i did
1	while peter jay fernandez and jay o. sanders are n't the only actors to narrate the acclaimed cross series , they certainly are among the finest . with a host of television appearances to his credit ( law order , cosby ) massachusetts born hernandez has also made his mark on broadway in jelly 's last jam and the merchant of venice . his voice has a tad of huskiness , which makes it all the more appealing as cross . in all , fernandez has been featured in almost 12 of the alex cross tales , so he well knows the characters and easily inhabits each scene . to date , jay o. sanders has narrated over 50 audio books , and he 's a perfect voice partner for fernandez . his experience includes off-broadway roles in shakespearean plays , which may account for his remarkably clear diction and easy listening tone . the voices of fernandez and sanders complement one another as they bring one of the most compelling cross stories to life . it 's a painful attention-getter when we listen again to how cross lost his beloved wife , maria - she was shot down before his eyes . her killer was never found ; the case chalked off as another sick drive-by shooting . now , cross has returned to being a psychologist , his children are thriving , and perhaps he may be able to love someone again . however , a telephone call from john sampson , his old partner , changes all that . sampson wants cross 's help in finding a psychopathic serial rapist on the loose in georgetown . of course , cross ca n't say no but little did he realize that this investigation would lead him to a tie-in to maria 's death some years ago . one more rapid paced thriller from the amazing pen of james patterson read by two consummate voice performers . - gail cook
0	i bought this recording with high hopes . what better complement to reading shakespeare than hearing him , right ? well , not with this recording . the cast is made up of `` distinguished actors , '' the insert proclaims , but it 's obvious that these actors have n't done shakespeare since they were in junior high school . nor have they improved since then : none of the actors has any feel for the shakespearean line . the speaking is stiff and mechanical , and half the time it sounds like a monty python farce ! when there are no visual effects to distract us , low-quality acting really sticks out . for audio recordings , you need the best voices . too bad arkangel did n't realize this . my advice ? grind up these cds and use them to fertilize your nasturtiums
1	are you looking for a way to get your kids into the kitchen , turing out tasty projects ? i know i was -- and i went through about fifteen `` kids '' cookbooks at the local bookstore before i stumbled on this little gem . it was the only cookbook ( other than the everything kid 's cookbooks ) that would actually get a child into the kitchen . the projects are appealing on all levels -- they are easy to assemble , they are too cute for words , and they have super easy to follow pictoral instructions . it also has a good balance of entrees to deserts , unlike some of the family cookbooks i 've reviewed . and with the desserts -- like cookies -- it takes one basic recipe and shows you about four different ways to use it -- marvelous ! it 's also pantry friendly -- no star fruit or rare ingredients you do n't have laying around . now if you 're looking for a kids cookbook to vary your family 's fare , then keep in mind this is a slender picture-book sized volume -- you wo n't find more than 22 projects in the whole book . for a good standard family cookbook , i recommmend beyond mac 'n ' cheese by mops . but if you are looking to get your kids ( 12 and under ) into the kitchen to spend some time together having fun at the counter , then do n't hesitate to buy this little gem ! it is my number one recommendation for children 's cookbook , project-wise . for the above twelve set , i recommend the everything kid 's cookbook because it is a little more geared towards meals and has crossword puzzles and fun foods that are meant to be played with . if you are looking for a cookbook with tons of recipes that will appeal to your family , be pantry friendly *and* save you money , check out `` cheap . fast . good .

1	this is a fascinating read and my favorite of all bacon 's writings
1	paul johnson has written a 1,000-page book about various and sundry aspects of the years 1815-1830 , years in which he rightly claims to find the origins of many aspects of the world as we know it today . johnson 's chosen foci are certainly broad : he ranges from events in politics and law to music , science , and even opium use . while almost every page is loaded with fascinating morsels of information that will certainly come in handy when you want to impress people at your next social function , johnson 's roving eye and pen can be disconcerting : he tends to shift topics very quickly and without warning . also , while the book claims to be about `` world society , '' johnson spends the largest part of his time talking about british society -- but he 's found plenty of ways to range geographically from the `` western '' united states ( like kentucky ) to china and singapore . throughout , his prose is generally crisp and pleasant to read . overall , johnson has given us what might be the ultimate in bedtime reading : a vast book that one can pick up , open nearly at random , and learn something interesting about the past but which retains significance today
1	a lot of very useful info in a small book . i 'm less than half the way through and i 've already learned enough to make it worth the investment to me . the chapter on using tables was just what i needed . i would recommend this book to other beginners who are still trying to make sense of it all
0	one tiresome , heavy-handed simile after another ; agonizing , descriptive detail that unnecessarily prolongs action ; simplistic , trite phrasing and dialogue -- characters constantly express vague but contradictory emotions in the same sentence , an obvious effort by the author to provoke interest or conflict which falls flat ; routine characterization ; a sentence or two slipped in during a scene or an unexpected circumstance placed at the end of a chapter meant to build plot and suspense read as forced and predictable ; proofreading errors ; fragmented , poor sentence structure -- this book is amateurish writing all the way around . i can not fathom the reasoning for the quality of the professional reviews which this work received . i can not understand the lack of proper editing . i am an avid reader and approached this book with much enthusiasm , so imagine my disappointment when i was ready to put the book down a couple of pages into the prologue ! in fairness to the author ( and with a hopeful attitude ) , i forced myself through the first 70 or so pages , however with each turning page i found myself reading along just for sport , my mind constantly drifting and more and more incredulous ( and annoyed ) with this juvenile effort . what could have been a fascinating read due to the intriguing premise is instead a colossal waste of time .
0	i echo the comments of the previous reviewers . do n't waste your money . not only does this book present a tedious repetition of facts and stories already well known to even a casual u2 fan , it ca n't even get those facts right ! the book states that bono 's father dropped the family off at a catholic church before driving himself to another church . this contradicts the correct statement on the preceding page that bob hewson was catholic , while bono , his mother and brother were protestant . in the same paragraph the dublin neighborhood of `` glasnevin '' is misspelled `` asnevin '' . the hearing aid shop from which bono took his name is misspelled , and perhaps most galling of all , the author ca n't even get the full name of larry mullen , jr. right ! and this is just chapter one ! i have to agree that this book was simply thrown together to make a quick buck and therefore not worth purchasing . i would suggest skipping this one and purchasing bono : in conversation with michka assayas , which includes a pretty good account of bono 's life from the man himself .
1	music and culture are discussed , not with the usual artistic focus , but with a healthy blend of science and sociology added to the mix . is music a luxury , an art , or a biological need ? william benzon 's beethoven 's anvil explores links between music and brain functioning , using the history of music and its evolution to draw some important arguments about music 's importance to brain functioning as a whole
0	i have read almost all of the works in the past masters series . this is by far the worse . i do not ordinarily write about books i do not like . but this work truly deserves a bad word . it is not about shakespeare , but rather about germaine greer . she simply did not do the assignment that she was given
1	i dont agree with the previous reviewer at all . my kids love everything in this book and if i find enough time i want to make every single toy . they are not scary looking at all . if you like knitted babes by claire garland , you ll love this one . there are 5 themes in this book : enchanted land : princess and castle fairy dream : fairy and baby , flower pillow , unicorn wild trail : cowboy and mustang set to sea : pirate and ratty , dinghy magical waterworld : mermaid , fish , seahorse and crab , dolphin there are also pages on knitting , crochet and stitching basics . this is probably not a book for a beginner , but if have some experience you ll want to get your needles , hooks and yarn and just get going . i can only recommend this one . 5 stars ! ! !
1	the best book on the history of world war ii that i 've read in a long time . the title has three meanings : 1 . it can refer to the gunner at the back of a bomber . the brits called these people 'rear gunners . ' the yanks used the term 'tail gunner . ' it 's the most dangerous position in the plane . 2 . the last plane in the formation . this was more true in the american combat box than in british usage . this position is difficult to hold because it is at the end of a string and every move by the lead ship propagates irregularily through the formation . it is also more dangerous as enemy fighters can attack this ship more easily since there are n't so many guns pointing that direction . 3 . it can refer to the bombing missions near the end of the war . this splendid book covers all three of these meanings . in addition it does an excellent job of discussing the power and importance of air power in the defeat of germany
1	i had no prior experience with music playing ( other than blowing some simple tunes from a harmonica ) and , yet , i found this book to be surprisingly easy to learn from . it smoothly and concisely guides the reader through the key elements of piano playing , starting with one-hand playing , but quickly to two-hands , then chords , etc. , and ending with sharp and flat notes . it is well organized , has well thought out exercises , advices , and a diverse collection of ( short ) attractive tunes of increasing complexity ( from jingle bells to waltzing matilda to silent night to green sleeves to we shall overcome to minuet in g minor ) . i prefer it to other teach-yourself piano books that take much longer to cover the same skills , such as the complete piano player or piano for dummies . i particularly like that it gets to two-hand playing almost right away , which i feel is better preparation -- even if it feels hard and slows the playing initially . it may have helped ( coordination-wise ) that i have been typing for 20+ years with both hands . if you are looking for a book that teaches all the essentials of basic piano playing in a thoughtful and concise way , then i recommend this book . if you perfer a slower pace , then maybe look elsewhere . for me , this was the perfect book to learn from .
0	it is fiction of course . it can not be otherwise for what it contends may happen is impossible ! many reviewers are upset . upset perhaps but they should not be worried . the church is protected by christ 's promise that it will not err . any person of faith sees this book as fiction . it is a poor attempt to disguise greely 's left wing theology as fiction . the message to those liberals who find `` hope '' for their cause in this book : it ai n't going to happen . recommended reading : `` women priests and other fantasies '' greely and his followers are delusional
0	despite the description and synopsis on the books cover this is not a computer crime novel . in fact with the exception of about 20 pages total the novel quickly looses its snazzy cyber crime appeal . in the first few pages we 're introduced to a dark haired female hacker but just as quickly she 's gone and the book spirals into japanese gangs , corrupt police , horribly bland and indistinguishable characters , and it just sucks from then on out . the story is good albeit incorrectly marketed . the characters however have no identity ! they all sound the same , with the exception of the japanese characters . sadly the book lacks serious writing talent , very little character development , on what could 've been a good story . one positive note perhaps is that the descriptions of japanese culture , etc . are really good . perhaps this is due to the authors departure many years before from england to japan . my advice : spend some time abroad again
0	the photo presented here is a bit too bright and the faces are not that orange in this paperback edition 's cover . however you can get a feel for the checked floor and how after opening the pages of the doorbell rang you get an eye sore with the blue checkered tablecloth in the kitchen with the blue stove and red appliances . the mother and daughter are both redheads and there is a black cat that hangs around during the story that takes place in the kitchen . with just twenty pages my seven-year old breezed through the book in six minutes . the favorite character in the book according to my son is the cat and watching where he was throughout the story . the doorbell rang begins with a mother placing a plate of cookies on the kitchen table for her son sam and daughter victoria. `` i 've made some cookies for tea , said ma '' . the children each took six cookies comparing the look and smell of these cookies to grandma 's . by flipping through the pages of the doorbell rang it looks like the kitchen table got bigger , but upon further inspection the same number of chairs are there , but more kids around the table and fighting over the seats . the cat is making his way around the kids to receive pats on the head and attention . more kids arrived bringing a bicycle and a doll carriage and the table shows each kid with one cookie . it is hard to tell if the cookies are on white plates or that is just part of the checkered tablecloth . the serving plate is clearly empty at this point and all the kids turn to see the latest bell ringer . meanwhile over at the stove the steam is continuing but at a larger pace and it looks like fresh water now in the orange pail . the final arrival for this story is grandma , with a large cookie sheet type tray carrying freshly baked chocolate chip cookies . all the kids leave the table to greet her and the cat ends up alone on the kitchen table . not very sanitary as far as i am concerned and my son noticed no napkins or drinks at the table . the dirty floor was bothering him as well and he wondered why the kids never took their shoes off for that is something we all do upon entering our home . the portrayal of the mother and how the stove was not being attended and having the cat on the table bothered me . the kids not stopping to wipe their feet or hanging up their own belongings and no one washing their hands before having a cookie and who knows how many times the kids each touched one of them . at least the kids were dressed nice and the bucket of water never spilled and the mother finally sat down . for a new reader this might be a fun read but for more than one read i highly doubt there would be interest . there is a lot of repetition with the arrival of new kids and then the sharing of the cookies while comparing them to each child 's grandma 's cookies . there are roughly two to four sentences on each page . the good news is that my son did not ask for any cookies after reading this
1	based on the description , i expected this to be a davinci code knock-off , but gave it a shot since i recieved a free copy . comparing labyrinth to the davinci code do it injustice ; this is definately not an imitator and is worth reading in it 's own right . i enjoyed the characters , plot , and switching between the past and present . i 'm not sure it has literary value ( i would n't argue that the davinci code does , either ) , but it 's certainly complex enough to make you think about the plot and character relationships without being difficult to follow
1	the purpose of nessus is to provide an open source solution for network auditing on all unix like systems . this book not only details using nessus but also comes with a cd containing the program , as well as ethereal , snort , and newt ( a port of the program to the windows environment ) . what is a network assessment ? at its basic level it is an attempt to detect a live system and then identify the computing environment , services , applications , and vulnerabilities on that system . basically there are two types of assessment - internal and external . an internal assessment is done over the local network and external is done from outside the lan . nessus will do both types and the book details how to do either , or both of them . the authors do an excellent job of detailing installation , setup , and how to interpret the results of a scan as well as various factors that can affect the report . one of the parts not to be missed is the discussion of not only the benefits but also the potential problems of scanning your system . some of the vulnerability types scanned for include buffer overflows , default passwords , backdoors , information leaks , and denial of service . the nessus scripting language is covered in detail in appendix a instead of the main portion of the book ; a choice i appreciated very much as it allowed the flow of the book to not be interrupted by such a highly technical section . with open source products there generally is no organized technical support phone number you can call of help . so , the authors include information on how to get help via the nessus user community , mailing lists , and archives . nessus network auditing is a highly recommended book for anyone interested in auditing their network to find potential problems before they become reality
1	ms. phillips certainly knows how to tug at those heart strings ! i felt as though i were right there with mac and sammy jo , feeling the emotions they felt . this is a great story that proves that true love can happen when it 's least expected and that true love always prevails . i recommend this book to any romance lover
0	if we are to draw equivalent lessons from both the prague spring and street protests in the u.s. , as kurlansky attempts in this book , the connection should depend on more than that they simply occured in the same year . the reader is owed specifics , yet is rewarded with little more than vague platitudes . prague was a protest against a government which not only lacked representation and dissent , but prohibited it . chicago et al were protests against decisions made by a representative government , however flawed , resulting from open debate . a bigger difference could hardly be imagined . but kurlansky does see striking differences , albeit only in the post-1968 world . the soviet bloc began it 's decent to oblivion , while the capitalist west avoided the same . his disappointment in the latter is not hard to glean , though what manner of `` revolution '' he envisions is never rendered to specifics , likely for good reason . but who needs details when false equivalencies and empty platitudes will do
0	this is an overwritten and overhyped piece of fiction that will never pass for great literature . it is timely but it is not timeless . not one character comes alive even though they all talk endlessly . not one scene is memorable . the true nature of the book -- soap opera -- is cloaked under its many pages . messud is a good writer who in this instance could not tell a good story , and she seems to have believed her publicity machine . i ca n't believe that her husband , who a great literary critic , would not talk her out of publishing this . oh . i forgot . money and fame trumps quality every time .
0	i loved the earlier nevada barr mysteries , with their depiction of national parks and natural dangers . i was n't as happy with some of her latest efforts , but still had n't given up on her . now i 'm not so sure . this latest novel started off well enough although the idea of two severely traumatized girls should have been a clue as to what would follow . the idea that they were from a polygamous mormon sect was a red herring . perhaps it was barr 's attempt to show us how these girls were abused even before they met evil incarnate . the scenes where anna realizes who the real villian is and her interaction with him and the poor tortured third traumatized girl went on for over 60 pages . each scene was more disturbing the one before it . i found myself skimming the pages and still am not sure how she resolved all the loose ends . but i have absolutely no desire to re-read the end of the book and find out . i wish i could say that i would read another nevada barr novel because i so thoroughly enjoyed the first ones . but after reading this disturbing , somewhat convoluted story , i would think twice . if i did pick up another anna pigeon novel , i 'd make sure i had something else to read if the story took another dark turn . i would certainly not stick with it to the end .
1	this book was great . it read well and never was too slow . it was fair to both sides of the war and the leaders who fought the battles and planned the campaign . it was complete in that it discussed the men , tactics , weapons , and terrain in the southern campaign . not only was this book a great souce for the southern war but it also gave good insight into the revolutionary war in general . if you 're interested in this topic and want to increase you 're knowledge of the southern war , get this book . it 's informative as well as pleasing to read
0	i was raised in virginia and never understood the details of the battle of yorktown . now i see the big picture and how all the regional events in the glorious cause fit together . immediately after finishing this book i returned to yorktown with an entirely different understanding . i could relive the battle as if i had been there during the war . it was fascinating ! i never learned this from history books . male age 60
1	thirty years later and this classic remains a compelling read . this book has fueled a thousand others , setting the perspective for all those interested in the building blocks of life . it 's a genes-eye-view of where we came from and how we are motivated , a science and reason-based treatise that is compulsory reading for those of us intent on learning from and about our remarkable natural history . other books by dr. dawkins maybe an easier read but this is where it all started
1	i read an interview with mr. vollman , i think a couple years ago , i ca n't quote directly but he said he thought that prostitutes were very spiritual people . they save marriages , they provide comfort to the loneliest , most desperate among us . in practically the same breath he observed that they spread disease and sometimes rob their johns . that kind of duality is at the heart of much of vollman 's writing . on the surface , whores for gloria is one desperate , delusional man , so eager for even the illusion of relatedness that he attempts to recreate gloria with bits and pieces of other prostitutes . it is n't fully clear if gloria herself was ever real , but regardless , it is now a quest to fill that void collage style with physical samples , such as hair clippings , as well as emotional artifacts . the most poignant scene may be the protagonist hiring a prostitute , and wanting nothing more than to hear happy childhood memories . the prostitute complies as best she can but , story after story , the narratives veer into disturbing material . the hardest thing for the human to do is to hold opposite opinions about one thing at the same time . the more intelligent and observant one is , the more painfully aware of the absurdity of this task , the more painfully aware of the mental contortions necessary to maintain the illusion of meaning . this is where the magic lies in true artistc genius , such as a thelonius monk solo or , in this case , vollman 's writing . i 've never read anything that better communicates simultaneous beauty and ugliness . and no better forum than gutter sex , which vollman renders both repulsive and compelling . and he does n't do it by being overly clever . he does it through the chaos of brute honesty . whatever compositional gymnastics go into the writing , the end product is very readable and deceptively simple
1	leah stewart is a talented writer . i read this book after finishing her most recent novel , the myth of you and me ( which i highly recommend ) . this story is dark and chilling . olivia is a young reporter covering crimes in memphis on a hot summer . when the body of girl is found , the case becomes eerily personal for olivia and the lines between professional duty and personal struggles become blurred as she gets deeper into the murdered girl 's story and life . the characters in this novel are deep and well developed , and the sultry atmosphere of a hot summer in memphis is well rendered . i highly recommend this book
0	i 'll reread any of lipman 's books multiple times - except this one . boring and disappointing finish
1	this is the first piece of writing i have read from albert camus and i found it very interesting . the character meursault is a very indifferent character who seems to be very impartial when he hears of his mother 's death and kind of continues to be static untill the the second half of the book . i do not want to give the book away as some of the others have , but i feel that no matter what one person does and no matter what ones perception is , it can never match the perception of others . one of my favorite lines in the story is when meursault is talking to the chaplain about seeking redemption through god because according th chaplain `` it is not the human justice that matters but divine justice '' and meursault 's response was `` it was the human justice that put me here '' . no matter what acts you commit , whether they be henous , incensitive or loving , one way or another you will be judged and upon that judgement will be your sentence . it was definitely an easy read that takes the readers on a ride into the thoughts of a man who accepts the one thing he can not change ; his fate . `` with this , i dont even have a chance to survive , not even a slim one ''
0	a little outdated , quite a few beers here are n't made anymore . beer reviews are always personal opinion , and you 'll read a bunch of people complain in these reviews that this guy does n't know what hes talking about . i 'd ignore what they say , everybody has their own preference . think about this before you buy this book : 1 ) why do you need to hear what somebody else things of beers ? 2 ) its very out dated ... 5 years is a long time
0	while i think the basics of the book are good , i do n't like how fat-free items are treated as always being the best option . i did much better on the south beach diet , where good fats in moderation is emphasized as well as natural foods . fat is what makes us feel satisfied . after years of trying to diet by limiting fat , it was a revelation to me i could lose weight without feeling hungry and deprived . an omelette made of egg whites and fat-free cheese is not at all satisfying and not necessary . secondly , many foods are altered in a negative way to make them low-fat . i just noticed this week that cool whip lite has high fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated vegetable oil as two of it 's top ingredients . this ca n't be better for you than actual cream . i also prefer the book `` french woman do n't get fat '' , which emphasizes enjoying food by eating smaller portions of good , natural food when it 's in season . the pleasure of good food makes you stop thinking diet and start thinking about lifestyle . i feel that the g.i diet is oversimplified and written to appeal to an audience that has never thought about eating right before . i think this book is about the mechanics of healthy eating when the cause of overeating is a lot more complicated . it certainly can help get people on the right track , but i think there are better books available .
1	tony kern has managed to pull together the wisdom and experience of `` the best '' pilots around . his use of case studies of real pilots and real situations includes examples from the military , commercial , and geneal aviation communities . in short , the book is useful for any pilot whether they are working toward their private pilot license or are employed as a senior airline captain . for many pilots , it will reinforce what they already know and practice but for many , it will provide the opportunity to become `` old '' pilots . if you fly , read the book
0	a singularly dull book , the characterizations seemed flat and the peg on which the novel is hung , a south victorious with modern weapons , seemed too trivial . the author has to make something compelling in that conceit or for the reader the book will mean nothing . unfortunately there seems little real purpose to the idea unless one finds the characterizations of historical figures believable and they are not . the character of robert e. lee in the book is just too , too good to be sympathetic or even credible and the stock characters that pop up to lend support seem like cardboard cutouts . i finally felt that the book was going in such an obvious direction that i put it down halfway through . i am not sure if it turns out the way i think but frankly there was nothing in the first half of the book to make me care one way or the other
0	i was very excited when i got my copy of this book . i am a big fan of medical thrillers . i started with robin cook and michael palmer and from then on i was hooked . unfortunately for me , i selected the wrong book . it was very slow and he did n't pick up the pace until i was about 60 pages from the end . then all hell broke loose . i have a feeling that josh got a little help from people telling him to `` spice it up '' . all in all , i was disappointed and still do n't know what perv means . hope he does better on his second . i will give it a try but only the first 50 pages . if he has n't hooked me by then , i 'll give up
1	tina dirmann did a fantastic job writing about this difficult case , which encompasses motherhood , mental illness , child abuse , and matricide . dirmann does not interject her own biases or agenda into her writing , rather she presents the many different angles of this story in a compassionate fashion . that , in and of itself is impressive , because many writers of true crime tend to lean one side or the other , get caught up in emotion , and appear unable to really present all sides of the story . lessons can be learned from this book regarding mental illness and society 's responsibility to help families who are in need of intervention . it is so sad that the extended families of these boys failed not only them , but also tragically failed their mother .
1	in this book you get 35 projects/designs marked with skill levels needed for each project . the projects are mostly made with wire , but pearls are also used , in most of the projects . i would say that this is a book for you who has made jewelry before and are familiar to wirework . if so it is a wonderful book ! this book offer lots and lots of inspirasjon and expertise
1	the need for assassins is great - the evil keeps cranking up beyond belief as the suspense continues to buld . what a book and what a series - more please
1	this book consists of 29 stand-alone essays , beautifully written and previously published in the `` new england journal of medicine '' during the early seventies . from the first chapter : `` the viruses , instead of being single-minded agents of disease and death , now begin to look more like mobile genes ... we live in a dancing matrix of viruses ; they dart , rather like bees , from organism to organism , from plant to insect to mammal to me and back again , and into the sea , tugging along pieces of this genome , strings of genes from that , transplanting grafts of dna , passing around heredity as though at a great party . '' although there is no continuity from chapter to chapter , there are consistent threads of thought as the author free associates : 1.there is a joyful attitude about science and discovery and abundant tidbits about the goings on of living things . 2.there is constant reference to the interaction , symbiosis , and co-operative living arrangements amongst the different species . 3.there are numerous references to the mindless activities of ants , bees , and termites , whose activities create sophisticated , developed projects without any evidence of central control . these examples are repeatedly compared to humans and their social activities , with the human emphasis being on language . 4.the cell is the unit of life , complete with all its intricate inner workings . the cell membrane ( cell wall in plants ) is the protective layer that makes this unit of life possible . in the first chapter and frequently throughout , the author wants to think of the earth as a kind of organism , but he ca n't make it work - too big , too complex , too many working parts without visible connections . then in the last chapter , a better analogy emerges . the earth is like a huge cell and the protective atmosphere that shields us from meteors and cosmic rays is our cell membrane . this fine book is a precursor to books from the likes of carl sagan , richard feynman , and stephen jay gould . reading the chapters randomly is not a bad idea - each one is only four to six pages long and each gives the reader plenty to think about . amazingly , after 30 years , there is a little - but not much - in this book that is out of date . if you are a little rusty on biology , have your `` oxford dictionary of science '' handy . first class .
1	what a great little accessory for my camera . could have used it in seattle last month , boy did it rain
0	i was very happy with the previous model dsc-n1 , which took very nice pictures just with pointing and shooting . but this one , while i only had chance to use it indoors and outdoor in raining weather , it really disappointed me . the pictures are always blured due to too much exposure , i used auto flash , for which the camera should takes nice pictures as it is a point and shoot camera and it is 10.1mp ! i 'm going to try more when the weather gets better but most possible i will return it , i just ca n't accept the quality of the indoor pictures it takes . i doubt i was unlucky and got a bad one , i ca n't believe a 10.1mp sony camera takes so poor pictures . and after reading the previous review about the terrible sony custmer servce , i decide i will avoid sony customer service , and the camera will just be returned . note : found the review by cecelia choy `` cece '' on march 13 , 2007 mentioned the same problem i had . i did n't have this problem with my previous model dsc-n1 . april 17 , 2006 : i bought a new one and it takes nice pictures now ! suggestion for those having the same problem i had before -- exchange for another one ! !
0	i made the mistake of selecting the bundle without reading the requirements closely . the lens is for a variety of canon cameras but the adapter only works with the a6xx series . my adapter arrived and it does n't work with my camera . kinda misleading and now i have to spend more to buy the correct adapter separately . bummer . also , captain jack is correct about the vignetting . this lens is sort of like a magnifying class that sits in front of the built-in zoom lens . if you zoom wide angle , you see the horrible vignetting he mentioned . if you stay zoomed in , it works ok . disappointing
0	to customer before me , you camera d200 might be on recall . please check the nikon website for more info . you have described the exact recall problem . good luck ! btw , have you tried or someone tried this battery on a d70 ? i am thinking to consolidate and have all greys batteries rather than black for the d70 and grays from the d200 .
1	i have gone from the old 640x480 about nine years ago to a 3.1m for the last few years to the canon 20d now , what a pleasure to shot . the battery life has not been an issue even with over 250 shots , which should be sufficient for most anybody . there is a small learning curve but you would expect this with any new camera . the lens choice was a great idea which came from an earlier review of the excellent walk around ability of this lens from the general shots to the closeups of those favorite flowers . for those individuals who are on the fence about this product i tout it to all i have spoken to . it turned a good photo experience on our west coast road trip into a real serious photo shoot , it also uses the commonly accessable compact flash . the built in flash works well have not had to explore the options at this time . the delivery of this item when promised was a nice bow on the package
0	i would agree with the other review . the indoor/low light quality of the video is unacceptable . i will be returning the camcorder today to purchase another
1	i 've had this camera for about 1 1/2 years now and it 's been a tried and true companion . i 've easily taken over 10,000 shots with it and produced some really exceptional photographs . the features that really set this camera apart are the 12x zoom , the image stabilization ( a must with such a large zoom ) , and the rotating screen ( great if you want to take a picture of yourself : ) ) . i also love the macro mode , i 've gotten some great quality close-ups . for most situations you can just stick it in auto mode and get great results , but the different scene modes are fun to play with as well . performs extremely well outdoors -- wildlife , sports , landscape , beach , etc . my only real complaint is its performance in low-light situations . pictures are grainy and the camera is very slow to respond , sometimes not responding at all . also it can eat through batteries fairly quickly -- regular aa batteries lasted me about 2.5 hours of continuous shooting ( around 200 pictures ) or less if i was shooting in cold weather . i would definately recommend rechargable batteries . overall i 've really enjoyed this camera . i 've used and abused it and apart from low-light situations ( which i was rarely in anyway ) it never let me down . both my grandmother and my great aunt bought one within the past 6 months and they rave about it
0	beware of assuming that the uv filter recommended by amazon for a particular camera with a fixed lense size that i purchased is the correct size . it was n't even close . no size was given for the lense diameter . i returned the filter for a full refund minus my shipping all the hassel of packaging it
1	i 've had a ton of these , and i take them on camping trips with kids where the main activity is playing in big mud fields . i 've had them in my pocket while rolling around in the mud , taken it out , shot a few pics , put it back in the pocket with no problem . ( see pictures for examples of `` mud photos '' ) a couple of times i 've had them stand up to so much moisture and abuse that the cardboard falls off , but still had beautiful pictures every time , no jams or over-exposures . i 've found the two pack at walmart on sale for $ 8.99 a couple of times , and you absolutely can not be that deal . this is my favorite disposable camera , and i 've tried them all .
0	i bought this lens in may for my brand new rebel xt . i used it on a vacation mainly , and am pretty dissapointed . i 'm no pro , or even skilled amateur , but i do know the lens is not giving me quality shots . the autofocusing is slow , and af or manual shots are n't very sharp at any zoom . there seems to be a fingerprint on one of the inner lenses that indicates poor quality control to me . i wanted a good , all around lens before building a real lens collection of different types . i guess this would fit the bill , if it took sharp pictures . i would n't pay more than $ 150 for this lens again
0	i was extremely disappointed with this product ; i felt very let down by sony , because for years i bought sony items with confidence , knowing that anything produced by them would be good and reliable . this item only goes to prove that sony 's standards have dropped and , as such i will use considerable caution when buying anthing else of theirs . what lets this product down is the lack of distance one can be before the sound breaks up ; 2 metres ( not 45 metres as stated on the wrapping ) was the best i could do , and that was in a straight line . no , all this item is fit for is the rubbish bin
1	this rangefinder is great ! much lighter than the big bulky other units . has all the great features that is needed . this is one that you will take with you and not leave in the truck because it 's too big . i tested this against some of my buddies ' bigger units at known distances and this one out did the bigger units in speed and accuracy . great scan mode . best buy . should be sold for about ( $ ) more than asked for
0	the camera feels slick . the software that comes with it gets a 4 star for efficiency , though the intuitiveness is not its strength . while the large lcd display is terrific ( the main reason i got it ) , it is worthless in a high glare situation . you ca n't see what you are shooting . it 's worthless ! and since nikon did not give you a viewing lense for such situations , there are times whey you have no idea what you are shooting . while the viewing wheel , to rapidly cycle through the shots you 've taken , is quite handy , the rest of the navigation is less than intuitive , and often takes so long to figure out that you give up . pictures are generally good , though the conditions have to be perfect , or you get grain or blur . there is one lovely feature , but it is only useful on a tri-pod . it is a function which allows you to take a flash photo and have the aperture remain open for a little while after to fill in the background . it creates flash shots without the black void background typical of such pix . i use that feature a lot , but its worthless without `` legs '' for the camera . i bought this on a whim , counting on the nikon reputation . had i known , i would have stuck with the canon
0	it 's only redeemingly quality is the price ( if you get a good deal ) . photo quality is poor , and screen is quite small ( 3x5 ) . navigation is not overly complicated , but buttons must be pushed hard to work . it did work perfectly fine - took sd card , even connected to my mac and drag and drop photos onto the sd card i inserted into the frame . but , because of the poor quality of the photos , i do n't suggest buying
0	i 'm giving this a 2 stars only because my daughter also had this camera on her wish list . if not i would of been upset having recieved the wrong camera that i ordered ... ... ...
0	i bought the converter since i wanted to use it for landscape photography . i took some test shots and discovered that the converter has an unacceptable amount of barrel distorion . if you are thinking about buying this product just be aware that you will have to correct your images through software after you take them
1	after a week of testing this camcorder , i found it good enough for daily use . the hd2 does not come with an sd card , so make sure you buy one before or at the time you get the hd2 . i got a 2gb sd a-data and a 4gb sdhc qpi class6 . both worked fine . the 4gb gives me about 1:20h in standardhd mode , and 55mns in superhd mode . i did n't notice a speed difference between a class2 and a class6 sd card using the hd2 , i think you should be fine with an 8gb sdhc class2 . my first impression of the camera is how small it is , however it may not fit in a jean pocket . it turns on very quick , you can start filming within 2secs of startup . it has a lady voice telling the mode you are using ( ie camera mode ) , not sure if this is useful for others , but not for me . the video and still pictures are great outdoor . the video quality is impressive during a bright sunlight . in a room lighten by a 60w equivalent fluo light , the video quality is grainy/noisy , this has been confirmed by other people as well . the high sensitivity feature ( to boost the image quality at low light ) helps but not enough . my 7yrs old sony digital8 does a better job at 1lux . i noticed that video quality is grainy at low light , but 7mp still picture quality is very good for the same lighting . compared to my new canon sd800 at 7mp , it is obvious the canon digital camera wins . on the video side , i played with several configuration , iso setting , white balance , resolution , etc ... it does helps , but the video is still grainy at low light . this camcorder has not been designed for low light filming . i ran into an issue when transfering the video pictures from the hd2 with its cradle to the pc via usb connection . i got errors transfering the files if you use the craddle ( this will freeze the hd2 ) . i am not sure why , i have to check with sanyo on this . if you connect the hd2 directly to the pc ( without the cradle ) , the transfer goes smooth . so there is an issue with the cradle and usb port . i am also using pinnacle studio 10.5 for my video editing . so far , i have not been able to use it and control my hd2 . you can however copy the files from sd to your pc , and use these files with pinnacle studio . since i film most of the time outdoor during daytime , this camera does the job fine and video quality is great . i would still give a 5 stars even with the video issues at low light .
1	i bought one of these for my canon sd-800 and can recommend it . for many years now , i 've carried canon pocket cameras on my belt while traveling and the canon-branded cases are simply the best for this purpose . my only criticism of the canon cases has been their lack of a small pocket for media . i was hoping that with the tiny size of sd cards canon would have added such a pocket to their newer cases , but they have n't . on the plus side , the case retains the superior leather construction , uses a neat magnetic tie down for the flap instead of velcro or a snap , and has a belt loop that is tight enough to hold the camera comfortably against your body . the package also includes a nice looking leather replacement strap for your camera . incidentally , the sd-800 is well matched to the case , fitting quite securely
0	this is the worst camera i 've ever owned . i 'm not exaggerating . i 'm so upset for wasting money on it . the only pictures that turn out , are outside in bright daylight . it takes horrible pictures in low light , there 's a high level of noise in the photos . the video mode moves in and out on its own , ruining the video . i sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos . my friend 's $ 88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing . it just plain sucks .
1	i recently purchased this camera . it arrived one day before i was due to fly out to palm springs . i took lots of pictures with this camera and was pleased with all of them except the night time pictures . this may or may not be because i am a novice photographer . even with the night time setting my pictures came out blurry , but all others came out better than i ever expected . i think once i play around with it , my night time pictures will improve , but straight out the box this was kinda disappointing to me . no regrets with this purchase though . also , buy a larger memory stick . the one that comes with the camera only stored 6 pictures and i had to run out and buy another .
0	i only wish i had read the previous review before i bought this item . i too was trying to convert my hi8 tapes to digital format using the pass-through on my sony minidv handycam . i bought this way-too-expensive cable , mostly because it was the only option available . it seems ridiculous to me that a cable should cost as much as a low-end disk drive or graphics card , considering the technology involved in those devices . but my real problem is with the failure of sony to reveal that the s-video connection is useless for input . this information is nowhere on the package , nor is it on their website . there is a notice saying `` please make sure this cable is compatible with your camcorder before you purchase '' . you ca n't read that warning when buying online , and if buying at a store , there 's no way to know what 's compatible because they do n't include a list of compatible camcorders on the package . i guess they assume everyone will run home and check their website , then come back to the store and buy it , instead of just buying it and seeing if it works . there is a section of the handycam manual describing how one might record from another video device using a cable such as this one , however they fail to mention that the sony cable wo n't work , despite the premium price they charge . if the problem is that they could n't make it work with both a composite and s-video cable , then they should have just made it work for s-video , since a composite cable comes with the camera . shame on you , sony , for adding a little aggravation to my day , and shame on you for creating yet another proprietary communications standard that allows you to rake us over the coals when we need to buy accessories supporting that standard . it 's enough to make me want to buy a canon camcorder ( i buy canon digital cameras precisely because i do n't want to submit to proprietary sony standards like memorystick ) . rant over .
1	i am in love with this camera . the shutterspeed is awesome , the quality of pictures is awesome , and the shake reduction feature is awesome ! ! i would recommend this camera to anyone looking for a great camera !
0	i gave this picture frame to my wife for a christmas gift , we pluged it in and within a half an hour it made a loud bang and smoke poured out of the thing like crazy ... .not a good gift .
0	unfortunately i had to return the unit because it was not designed to be used on a mac 10.4 program ( the tech at the company said he was not aware it was meant to be used by a mac .
1	i have not yet used an fz30 or fz50 , but i think this thing beats the pants off an fz5 or fz10 as far as image quality is concerned . really nice camera . has a nice dslr type feel . 71 % of people that check out the fz20 here actually end up buying the fz7 , ( as of today ) but i do not believe the iq of the fz7 could hold a candle to that of the fz20 . buyers may be on the *more megapixel* bandwagon . you can do a lot with 5 megapixels . i have found that the iq of the fz20 is very close to that of a dslr
1	case is pretty much what you see ... i have no complaints . = ) the case protects my camera very well
1	i got a nikon laser rangefinder for chrisymas and it had an 8x magnification . i found this to be to powerful for golf.i could not hold it steady on the flag.the 6x magnification on the bushnell yardage pro scout was much better . also it is very compact and stores easily in my golf cart . the price from amazon was well below i could find anywhere else .
0	in the past , i have considered amazon to be one of the better and more reliable online shopping websites . to be perfectly honest , i am no longer sure . two months ago , i bought this camera set from 47th st photo that was being sold on amazon . this camera set was called the 1 gb stylus 720 sw kit . ironically , the case did not fit the camera and the card reader did not even support 1 gb cards ! my first thought was that 47th st photo made an oversight with the accessories . two weeks after receiving the kit , i emailed 47th st photo to inform them of the mistake . after waiting a few weeks for a response , i decided to send them a second email . again , no response . by this point , i felt helpless and turned to amazon for aid . surprisingly , amazon was not much better than 47th st photo . minutes after sending the email to amazon , i received an automatic email informing me that amazon had received my email . that was the last i heard from amazon . more than two months have passed and i have not heard from either company
0	after reading the many good reviews here , i too bought the lenmar battery to act as a second battery for my canon digital camera . i was totally pleased with the excellent performance as many others have noted . the only difference i noticed between the lenmar and oem battery was that with lengthy continuous shooting with the lcd screen on the camera case got significantly hotter with the lenmar battery that with the oem . this was not a problem until i was shooting on a 101 degree day ( with the lenmar battery in ) and suddenly the screen went black . i could view previously taken pictures ( lcd ok ) but any new photo i tried to take was black . i read later in the manual the upper operating temperature of the camera is 104 degrees . once the camera cooled it worked again for a while , but the black photo problem continued intermittenly for a few weeks then the camera completely stopped taking photos , no matter what . so , was it the lenmar battery 's extra heat generation pushing the camera over its temperature limit and damaging the circuitry ? would it have happened if the cooler running oem battery was installed on the hot day ? i ca n't say for sure , but if you use a lenmar battery i would be careful about operating it on a very hot 100 degree day ( e.g . use the viewfinder , not the lcd since that generates heat , or turn the camera off a lot to cool down between shots ) .
1	i purchased this tripod from 47th street photo through amazon.com . the tripod appeared to arrive in good shape , except that the operating instructions were not included . i immediately emailed 47th stree photo at the customer service address printed on the flyer they included with my shipment . i asked them if they would be able to send me a copy of the operating instructions . they did not respond to my email , so a few days later i emailed them again . once again , no response . i then emailed amazon.com , and informed them of the missing instructions and the non-responses from 47th street photo . no response from amazon either ! as far as the tripod goes , it appears to be a very good value for the money . i gave it 4 rather than 5 stars because , due to the missing operating instructions , i can not be certain i have properly checked out all of its features . however , i am certain that both 47th street photo and amazon.com rate zero stars for customer service . i will use neither one again
1	this seemingly simple piece of molded plastic was recommended to me by a professional photographer . basically it 's the shape of an open box that slides firmly onto the flash . it is small and sturdy enough to stash in your camera bag without worrying about damage . when used the light disperses more evenly and is less harsh on the subject being photographed . the white box is for general use . also available are the green omni-bounce for florescent lighting and the gold omni-bounce for a warming effect . pros : inexpensive solution for better flash photography . a quality product that works . cons : non
0	after being an amature photographer via print film , i decided to try a digital camera - though i 've been leary about printing quality . i knew i could n't afford a digital slr , so i opted for a `` snap shot '' camera that i thought would have enough features to satisfy me . however , after having and using this camera for a year now , i am so disappointed in the performace- the flash is just way too much , its a washout . after being used to print and picture quality in my film slr ( cannon , i might add ) , i was so severely annoyed with the quality of the pictures with this camera , i wish i would have just saved my money for a digital slr .
1	my husband is away ( military ) and i was looking for the perfect , small but clear , pictures for him . i did n't care about the frame , only the small white digital system . i was hesitant , as my mil has a digital keychain and the picture quality is horrible . i was pleasantly surprised at the picture quality and the ease of both looking at pictures already on an sd card and transferring pictures from the computer . i love that i can use either batteries or the included plug . everything was soooo easy that i did not even need to read the instructions to begin . i also purchased the small case to put this in for travel as the album is just an added extra for later . this is the best investment for anyone looking for something very small and portable . perfect to send a military loved one lots of pictures to keep them involved no matter how far away they are ! then , when he comes home , it 's great for a portable album to carry anywhere
1	i can not help but giggle when i saw comments like `` great lens for the money '' . it is selling for $ 440 at here , even on so-called clearance . however , one can easily find the same lens at least $ 50 cheaper at some decent online camera store , such as b , ritz camera , etc . sad amazon..
0	as i have gotten older seeing the tiny print inside the view finder has become more dificult , as well a seeing the image clearly enought to get super sharp focus . i thought this might be a solution . this eyecup fails on all requards . worst feature , the optics are not nearly as clear as you would expect . second the magnification is so minimal as to be useless . last it has the cheep feel of cracker jack plastic , well and the optics to match . now i know where olympus had it manufactured
0	i received this filter and it had been used , seals were open and case that holds filters cracked , piece of plastic floating loose inside , smug marks on it . i was shocked , i order from amazon all the time and never had anything show up like this .
0	i bought this over the sony and i regret it . i get a tape eject error every time i try to rewind . i can only rewind at 10 second intervals before i get an error message to eject the tape and do the same thing over again . that 's a long time to rewind a 60 minute tape . many canon users are having this problem and the only way they address the problem which is clearly a mechanical problem is to charge a ridiculous price to send it off to be repaired . canon needs to own up to this problem and have a recall on the item . i will never buy canon again after they have turned a blind eye to a serious problem
0	i got it just today and used it for cleaning my lens . the solution might be useful , the blower is useful , the swabs can be useful with their pointed tips , but the so called `` magic cloth '' is anything but magic . it kept leaving lint on my lens
0	i was completely fooled . twice . my fiancee had told me she was getting me socks and underwear for christmas . so as i slowly open the box , i see a pair of socks on top . there was more underneath , so i start opening it further and there is a camera case , a memory card and then finally at the bottom of the box , the hp photosmart m525 digital camera ! i was overjoyed at finally getting a digital camera of my own . no more borrowing from my sister when i needed to snap a few pictures . i put the memory card and batteries in and began taking some pictures . to put it bluntly , ugh ! ! ! the first thing that i noticed is that , even in best picture mode , the pictures were a little blurry/grainy even in the best of lighting conditions . the second thing that i noticed is that the pictures are distorted . there 's a slight fisheye effect ( imagine looking through a peep-hole on a door . ) which is quite annoying . i talked to hp support ( someone who spoke very poor english i might add . what is the deal with that ? ) and after about 45 minutes of discussion it was determined that the easiest thing for me to do was to go back to the store and exchange it for the same model . guess what ? same problem ! so after talking to hp once again , i am returning this one and getting a different brand . this is a horrible product . my sisters kodak that i bought 3 years ago is a far superior product . i am very disappointed . hp needs to put out a better product , and have some customer support reps that speak better english . it gets frustrating repeating yourself over and over again to be understood
0	i had high hopes for this battery for my nikon camera . it promised more mah than the oem battery that came with the camera . unfortunately , it must be leaking electrons all over the place , since a charge in this model does not compare to the original . i would guess that the charge lasts half the life of the original nikon battery . the price was cheap and you get what you pay for . if you are going to purchase this one , get two since you 'll need to keep one charging while using the other . cheers
1	this case is great for the quick day outings . it is rugged and keeps the camera safe . my wife can throw it in her purse and i do n't have to worry about it getting banged up and she does n't have to worry about it being too bulky . everyone should have two batteries with any of the canon cameras since their battery meter only shows up minutes before it goes dead .
0	if you are looking to take high quality pictures , then look elsewhere . it is nice for taking quick snapshots with the family or what-have-you , but not much else . ( or for a beginner in photography or a child . ) you have to hold very still if you do n't want your pictures to come out blurry . also , the flash makes images far too bright and if you do n't use the flash it sometimes makes images come out far too dark . the only thing i like about this camera is it 's size . it 's great to just keep in your pocket or your bag ... anyway , i 'm buying a better one soon
1	the d300 is easy to use it takes great video outside , and is very good in low light . it also takes very good pictures , and the battery last a long time . i would buy it again
0	i bought this camera based on an older 3mp version a friend of mine has that i liked . the older model is far superior . this camera is slow to focus , slow to shoot , and slow to save . i took 5 pictures in a row of the same thing in the same lighting condition ( indoor , medium light ) on the automatic setting , all 5 pictures turned out different , only one turned out clear . i returned it the next day and bought a cannon that i am very happy with
0	when i was buying my husbands olympus camera this rechargeable battery popped up as a suggested purchase to go with camera so i ordered it . not paying close enough attention and because the title does have stylus in it i assumed it was compatable with the camera i was purchasing at that time . no it was not ! ! ! so i paid for and wraped ( christmas present ) something that did not only not work for the camera but made me look like a idiot shopper when my husband opened it and saw that it was not compatiable . now i have to figure out how to send it back for a refund which will cost me shipping charges yet again ... not to mention the frustration of a return ! ! ! ! not a happy amazon shopper !
0	amazon picture shows an original japanese-produced np-40 with 3.7v and 710mah ( just like the one i got with my f810 ) . what i got was a fujifilm-branded chinese-produced np-40 with 3.6v and 750 mah . yes , it works , but it 's just obviously cheaper . skepticism is a virtue
0	i bought three of these -- one for myself and one for each pair of grandparents . two of them stopped working . one of the two had tons of bad pixels and the other one just stopped . unfortunately , out of the warranty period ! and inquiry to the manufacturer has been ignored . i 'm out a lot of money for this garbage . do not waste your money on this garbage ! ! ! !
0	purchased this item in dec 06 ' screen burned out mar 07 ' . on top of that screen quality was not that great . do not order order this item
0	the battery which `` popped up '' with my camera order does not match the camera . thus i am stuck with the hassel of returning a battery . i was leaving for a trip when it arrived and so i had to go out and buy a replacement after it arrived .
0	i ordered the original item , used it for about a week , then sent it to my son in new hampshire . he used it less than fifteen minutes and it locked up , never to function properly again . i ordered a replacement , checked it out and sent it on to him , with the same result -- less than 15 minutes of use , it quit working . i thought the unit was nice , compact and fairly easy to use , but with two malfunctions in two cameras , i do n't think i would recommend this aiptek model to anyone
1	i purchased this prior to the birth of my son , and it 's doing the job perfectly . i do n't have a 2.4ghz phone at home so i ca n't say how it would 've affected its performance , but video and sound are very clear at a remote location . i 'm happy with the product and highly recommend it
0	there is a serious design flaw with this camera and it is even acknowledged on the faq section of the sony website . `` if there are dust particles floating in the air , they can be illuminated by the strong light of the flash and sometimes appear in a recorded image as white , round glare spots . this symptom tends to occur in low-light environments when using a compact digital camera due to the close proximity of the flash to the lens assembly . however , this is not a malfunction . '' read : your low-light pictures will have spots all over them ! sony does not think this is a problem . it is a design flaw . if you are only going to use this camera in full sun , then it is fantastic but seriously , there are many other cameras out there that do a much better job !
0	i bought this lens for my canon 30d after reading every professional review i could find . i knew going in that this lens was n't perfect but , was supposed to be better than the 18-55 kit lens . i liked the range that it provided and the image stabilization . i shot pictures with this lens and was extremely dissapointed . the pictures were not sharp at all and the colors were dull . i thought it might have been my new camera at first because i could n't imagine the quality would be this bad . i ruled this out after i used my canon 28-105 lens i had for my canon film slr and the results were much better . for the digital focal length though , my old lens would n't suffice because of the 1.6x focal factor . later , i decided on the tamron 17-50/2.8 after reading reviews . the salesperson at the professional camera store guessed that my pictures were very soft when i told him i had this canon lens . he said , `` let me guess , you 'd like to try the tamron 17-50/2.8 . '' he said that this was the very best lens to buy in the price range and to take it home and try it . i could return it with no questions asked if i was n't satisfied . he also said that he had n't had one person return it yet . my first images with this lens were great . they were sharp and had way more vibrant color . there is absolutely no comparison at all . i was hesitant to buy a third party lens but , my fears were instantly eliminated after seeing the results . this is the first review i have ever posted on amazon . i was so dissapointed that i wanted to help others not make the same mistake . after spending $ $ $ on a digital slr , it would be a waste not to get great pictures with it because of the lens . before taking a chance on buying the canon , do yourself a big favor and try the canon and tamron at a local store .
1	the changer performs perfectly . i was surprised that the price was so high for such a simple gadget . the only other drawback is that the cord is not as long as the original , about one foot shorter . other than that , it is fine . i gave my original changer to my daughter , whose charger died just before leaving the country
0	they tell you tha this product holds 6aa batteries , and works with the 20d 's battery grip , but when i received the item it is for a completely different product and does not work with the 20d 's bg-e2 grip . it has the product name of cpm-e3 , just as stated ... but it accepts 8 aaa batteries and does n't even come close to working with the bg-e2 .
1	excellent product for the price . pictures are not that good , but you ca n't ask more for this price
1	not too hard and not too soft . camera fits nicely , with compartments for just about anything you need for your camera .
1	i am 67 years old and started out in photography as a kid with a contact printer and a box camera . i have had all types of cameras over the years , mostly 35mm film canon slr 's . i too bought all sorts of these 5-7 mp point and shoot digital cameras before returning to my true love , slr 's . i have had my digital canon rebel xt about a month now and i ca n't keep my hands off of it . it lacks nothing . although the kit lense is good , i bought a 28-135 canon zoom lense with image stabilizion and have produced stunning photo 's with it . i love the way you can use the 7 points to focus , i mainly use only the center point with focus lock and never get an out of focus picture . i guess the nicest thing for me is that i now do n't have the urge to buy every point and shoot camera that is paraded out on qvc or hsn that has a `` wonderful '' new feature like `` low light or non-shake . '' this canon has every good feature in the known universe and you ca n't outgrow it . its a camera that will let you be as good as you can be , it wo n't hold you back . the battery life is great , the built in flash is good but i bought a 430ex and that 's even better . i never figure i 'm wasting money buying accessories for this camera as it will be my main squeeze for many years to come . i always missed my 35mm canon slr 's and now feel that i have an old friend back again , only much much better . believe me , you ca n't go wrong getting this camera , its beyond description ...
1	this is my second digital camera . although it does so much more than my first , it is much easier to operate . i especially love the fact that i can video my grandson 's baseball game , and then convert individule frames to photos ( jpeg ) with great quality . i have a series of photos with him getting a hit . it looks great ! thanks for a great product . ralp
1	i had been searching web site after web site for a system like this . i finally found a site where i could purchase seperate parts for a comparable system . however , the receivers alone were more than this unit ( if you wanted a receiver compatible with a plasma ) . this works great . could not be easier to install . all components are in my basement . i ran the eye through the wall and have the eye barely exposed through a single cable face plate , with the blue led light taped to the back of the plate . the blue light still shines through the faceplate , which is perfect . the faceplate is just below my wall mounted plasma set . no interference . this set up allows me to use this system at just about any angle in the room and the adjacent kitchen . works great with a basic $ 20 all in one ir remote . also , the customer service is like no other . i had several questions and each e-mail was answered by the next day with great help . made this purchase a no brainer . this is one product that far exceeded my expectations even after reading all the great reviews . i highly recomend this product .
0	the adorama silica gel came without any instructions on how to use and reuse it . i emailed customer service at adorama to ask how to use it and how to recharge it once it has absorbed enough moisture but they did not respond . i ca n't tell when it needs recharging and when it is ready . what color should it be and what color should indicate recharging . how to i recharge it ? nothing tells me how to recharge it . so far , money wasted . unresponsive to my emails
0	this camcorder has an excellent form factor and conveniently transfers clips to pc via usb . however , the camera picks up the sound of its own zoom and auto-focus , which makes the video unacceptable in my opinion . the clicking and whirring is louder than the level of normal conversation . we returned the first unit that we got thinking that it may have been a production defect , but the second unit had the same problem . apparently , according to the manual , this is `` not a malfunction ''
0	i agree with reviewer steve - anything less than a few hundred feet and these binocs are worthless . the paper works says the `` may '' focus down to 35 ' . maybe some will but not certainly not my pair . i am returning them since they are not good for simple viewing around the yard . and no , the rubber eye caps absolutely will not stay back making these binocs almost unusable by people with glasses ( like me ) . scot
1	for years now i have been buying `` bargain '' cameras with the foolish notion that i did not need a nice one . finally , i got sick of it and bought the exilim ex-z600 . this camera is awesome . the screen is huge , the picture quality is great , it is easy to use and is sooo small . overall , a great buy . the one downside is that i can only connect it to my computer using the dock . luckily , i have an sd card reader , so i normally just use that to download my pictures
1	the nikon s3 has proven to be a good buy . it is affordable yet takes a quality photo . in addition this camera is easy to use and fits conveniently in a pocket . this camera has the ranging ability to take both a simple aim and shoot photo , and at the same time complex skill shots that is complemented by computer editing and redeye reduction . my only complaint is as a result of the user . if the camera does not have time to focus , then the picture quality suffers immensely . this camera has only been in use for about two months but has not let me down yet ! my rating : 9/10
1	looks exactly as the posted picture except the badge reads `` panasonic '' , not `` lumix '' . fits the camera perfectly . no extra room for memory cards , spare battery , charger , etc . it 's easier to insert the camera with both zippers down . the belt loop wo n't fit most belts . no straps . however , the camera 's strap is good enough . good protection
1	it lasts a lot of shots , about 1000 shots , it 's amazing , with two of these batteries you have for almost a month in holiday without any recharge
1	this lens pouch is very durable and is of a good quality . it compacts down and does not have unneccesary bulk . might seem alittle pricey but is worth it in the long haul .
1	this is a really nice compact camera from canon . the picture quality is excellent . i have tried some night/day shots and the pictures are great . the zoom is the pretty much non existant at 3x however that depends on what you use the camera for . the build quality is excellent and i really love the 3 '' display . i find the ipod like controls very convenient too though it takes some practice to get used to it . the camera is very compact but i never had problems to get a good grip and a steady hand . the images have excellent true color and are indeed sharp . i would definetely recommend an accessory kit for this camera which includes a nice small leather case and an extra original canon battery and its available on amazon . the accessory kit turns out to be cheaper than buying the individual components and its contains original canon parts especially the extra battery . also get a sd card with large enough memory . what comes with the camera ( 32mb ) is really a waste . still do n't understand why these camera manufactures throw in such a small memory card . but overall a great easy to use and a smart looking camera that produces wonderful results
0	hello all , lens hoods are pretty much a necessity , but this has to be the mostly poorly made hood i 've ever used . unlike other hoods that screw on , this one requires you to press to opposing clips and then slide the hood one , and release the clips . this leads to problems of alignment , meaning both sides of the clip need to be perfectly aligned in order for the hood to fit right . although it 's a pain and i hate ... i do n't really have another alternative . either go w/o a hood , or take this one . either way , guess i 'd rather have a hood on the lense than not having one
0	if you like to take pictures with macro lense , it sucks . i 've had many canon cameras and this one takes the the prize for worst quality . if you get closer than five inches , the pictures messes up . i 've had no other problem with the hardware , though i hate carrying around that dock and it 's odd shaped charger . no other charger cable in the world is going to fit ! so loose it and you 're screwed . oh , and night photos also suck . big time , even with the flash on
0	this gets 1 star for the simple fact that it does n't seem to fit my mark ii body properly .
0	pros : great resolution . nice packaging . excellent door stop . cons : stopped working after 3 weeks . horrible overall quality . no customer support what so ever since i did n't have a receipt ( ebay purchase ) . tried contacting the ebay seller for receipt , never got a response now i 'm stuck with a 360 dollar dead weight . tried contacting pacificdigital they offered a none warranty repair for $ 199 . becareful what you purchase on ebay specially pacificdigital products .
1	i purchased this lens for my canon eos 20d digital camera and so far i really like it . it focuses fast and produces very sharp , clear images . as with any longer lens you do have to be careful about camera shake ; i 've had a few images come out blurry but these are usually interior shots . i really like the 28-200mm focal length range and find the lens to be very versatile for framing wide shots of buildings or landscapes to zoomed in shots for portraits or close detail shots . the lens feels solid and appears to be well constructed , which is typical for canon products . for the price range , this is an excellent lens . you can only do better by spending considerable more money on an is lens
1	do n't listen to the reviews that claim that this lens is not a good choice for cropped sensor cameras ( ie the 20d , 30d , rebels etc ) the canon l lens are the best and this particular lens is no exception . i have had the lens for less than 24 hours now and am in love with the sharpness and color already . great lens , great color , so well built , super sharp , just watch out if this is your first l lens , you 'll be hooked . this is a lens you will have for many years , great investment
0	the noise problem with this camera is horrendous . do not buy it ! if you take a close-up picture of an eye you will not be able to see the eyelashes clearly ... never . no matter how hard you try . my 3-year old 5mpx sony is much better than this panasonic camera . i am sorry i bought it . i would return this product if i could and buy a good camera instead . the lumix dmc-lx2 camera can not focus one bit , many pictures are out of focus and made worse by the noise problem . even with the motion smother function turned on many pictures come out blurred . noise is very noticeable with graininess appearing very readily . you can tweak the quality enhancing features for sharpness , noise reduction , contrast and saturation all you want but these are worthless to reduce the noice and sharpness problem . the amazon website says you can use standard sd memory which is untrue ( perhaps this has been corrected now ) . the camera only accepts more expensive sdhc ( high capacity ) cards . these sdhc cards can not be read by standard memory stick readers so i have to use the usb port which takes forever to download even a handful of pictures to my computer .
1	pros : - reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light . - helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches . - somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall . better to break the hood than the front element . - makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps to keep others from carelessly walking in front of you . cons : - will increase lens movement in windy situations , kind of like a sail on a boat . - takes up more room in your bag , even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens . - people take more notice of you , will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile
0	i had just recently bought this camera , and it was ok. the quaility of the pictures was pretty ok. i couldnt really understand it , and what really stinks is that i lost the stupid cd that comes with it and now i cant install it . overall i would say that the camera is a stinky peice of junk . now im begging my parent to buy me a reall digital camera ! ! not a peice of crap .
1	purchased a printer dock and camera bundle , from a local office supply store for $ 100 . it only came with a 10 picture sample cartridge , so i purchsed this from amazon . amazon had the best price around on this item and free shipping . it works great . no complaints . the paper is not quite as shiny and or as thick as the epson photo glossy paper that i still use for some pictures , but works well for my classroom , to give to my students . the pictures do not run like some inkjet pictures do if you accidentally drip water on them
1	very small and easy to carry . neat on the zoom , a bit hazy on the image stabilization but overall a good buy for the buck
0	i purchased this for my 4 year old son because he loves to take pictures . i did n't want to spend a lot of money , however this product is way over priced for the quality and ease of use . not to mention after having it less than 24 hours it completely stopped working . however , when it did work every single picture was blurry . there is only one button for every option and it is very confusing . i would n't recommend this product to anyone . it is being returned
1	i have the sony battery that came with the camera and bought an additional sony battery that allowed for 2-4 hours . however , i wanted a battery that i could count on for the better part of an `` all day '' event and i found it in the qm91d . i was asked to photograph a wedding from getting ready ( hair dresser at 0830 , until the end of the reception at 11:30pm ) the qm91d held strong . i did not constantly video tape , but with my digital recorder i had 6 sony 120 tapes ( 60 min digital ) -- 5 were captured using the qm91d . i did switch some of the tapes before they were completely used to make sure i did n't miss important events ... so i never actually used up `` all '' of the qm91d battery . this battery was used again during the evacuation from houston ( secondary to hurricane rita ) -- i used it entirely and it did not faulter ... it lasted throughout the trip and i had no need to change to the smaller batteries . the size of the battery did not really bother me -- i was aware that it would be larger than the others and it did not hamper the use of the camera . read the manufacturer information on battery life , charging time etc ... for this battery it is valid . i would recommend this battery .
1	easy to learn , takes very good photos in well-lighted areas but you do need to use the flash for dimmer environments - its low-light capabilities are n't that great . very fast readiness time from the moment you switch on the camera - a bit slow to recharge from a flash , though , and there 's a bit of a lag when you press the shutter button to when the photo is actually taken ( not so great for fast action shots , even though it touts a `` sports '' mode ) . it 's a good beginner 's camera , a good pocket-style camera , but certainly not to be mistaken for a high-end unit .
0	i lost my hp r607 while on vacation and needed to replace it quickly . i could n't fine another r607 ( which i really liked ) , so i purchased the hp m407 . i thought it would be the next best thing to my misplaced camera ... not ! ! i do n't like anything about this camera ... it 's terrible ! you can take about 4 pictures with regular batteries , about 10 with rechargeable ones ( even with screen off ) . it says `` auto focus '' , but i do n't think it has any focus at all ... .not far away , not close up , nothing ! it takes a really looooooooong time to actually take the picture after you press the button . i really hate it ! keep looking ... do n't buy this camera
1	this camera is a steal . the reviews on amazon helped me decide on this camera and sure it is worth it .
0	i found the same problem that other users of this product experienced . particularly the issue of the shutter release being at the bottom of the camera when composing a portrait oriented shot . i found a stroboframe flash bracket that rotates the camera counter clockwise within the flash bracket instead of flipping the flash . this leaves the shutter release at the top of the camera and also alleviated the other problem of speed light hot shoe breakage from repeated `` flipping '' of the flash that some other users have reported . the item is manufactured by stroboframe and can be found at an ebay store called `` gadget infinity '' under the listing title of `` flash bracket with 90 degrees camera rotate feature '' . buy it now price is $ 29.99 . i just bought one and it arrived yesterday and i could not be happier . pass the word of this ingenious new product that will solve the issues that have plagued photographers for the past several years
1	i just bought a digital rebel about a month ago . love the camera , my old 380ex speedlight integrates with the camera but just does n't offer enough cycle speed to keep up with continuous mode on the rebel . this flash does the job for the rebel and the plug for the external battery pack promises even better performance once i grab that item . another big selling point that really makes this unit worth the cash , is that it has its own infrared focus assist lamp which the digital rebel lacks . when this flash is mounted on your digital rebel , you do n't get that annoying set of quick flashes that the camera has to set off to focus in low light when using the built-in flash . the rebel body uses the infrared focus assist on the 550ex to focus the lens ; this feature alone is worth the big bucks this baby costs . the flash has tons of features that most of us might never use , but as a advanced amateur i 'm glad they 're there so i can play with that if i should choose to try out some fancy stuff . the wireless slave capability is handy but you 've got to have at least one more 420ex , 550ex or 580ex to use that . i like the digital readout on the back of the flash and also the two way bounce head , it 's important to note that you have to press a button to make the head turn either side to side or up/down -- -this should make the head sturdier than i 've seen on some units that get loose after awhile and drive you nuts . this unit is a honker -- really big , and , no lightweight either . get yourself a big deep camera bag if you want to lug this thing around with you . what 's the difference between this and the 580ex ? the 580 has very slightly faster cycle times and offers some fancy new automatic flash exposure bracketing modes , for me anyway it was n't worth almost two hundred dollars more for the 580 . all of the newer eos camera bodies are fully supported by this unit , it also works on older eos bodies but there are functions available on the newer ones that are n't there on older stuff . i like this flash it covers well , cycles fast and the controls are fairly intuitive and easy to use . when you get yours do n't lose that book , canon does n't seem to have them online anywhere i can find and i 've seen places that want to charge you 18 bucks for a new one
1	my bother-in-law and i went to africa on safari last year . we had purchased the binoculars especially to use while hunting . the optics were good and we were initially impressed by the image stabilization while still here in the states . our impressions were confirmed when our professional hunters fell in love with them during the hunt . they were so impressed by the is and price that we left a pair with our hunter . he used them for the entire season last year , and when he visited `` the states '' last month , he reported that they are still doing well
0	i loved this camera when i received it and used it a couple of times . then , it just stopped working . i have since purchased the same camera elsewhere and it is works great . maybe this was just a bad egg . good camera , but 2 months of use for the money was n't good
1	i have taught photography at the college level , shoot 4x5 view camera work on occasion , and am very demanding about image quality . i am quite satisfied with the image quality from my kodak p880 , particularly after i installed the newest firmware upgrade available from kodak . i went through several 7mp to 8 mp cameras before finally getting the kodak p880 . the p880 has better image quality than some high end sonys and olympus 7-8 mp cameras like the dsc-v3 or the sp350 . i tested the p880 against the even higher end 10.3 mp large sensor sony r1 and the difference in image quality in a 13x19 print between the p880 and the r1 was barely perceptible after minor sharpening and noise reduction , which the p880 images accept particularly well . the zoom lens has a very useful range and is generally pretty sharp throughout its range . balance , manual controls and features feel high end and adequate for most semi-professional needs . the camera is a little slow processing and storing pictures in raw format and exposure bracketing modes but that really does n't bother me because i do mostly landscape and fine art photos . raw file format is directly supported by most versions of adobe photoshop and photoshop elements as well as most other raw processing programs like bibble pro . unlike most sub- $ 500 cameras , the p880 uses regular screw in haze and polarizing filters , a real plus and it has a highly controllable hot shoe . manual focus is usable and manual exposure control works well . the direct mechanical zoom is also nice . overall , the p880 is a digital camera that can either be a high end point and shoot slr-styled camera or one that can be used as fully manually as the most classic 35 mm film slr . although not small enough to slip in a pocket , the size is still reasonable and light
0	this item is either not coated or has a single coating and thus any time sun hits the filter , it produces flare in the picture . furthermore , after doing more research it turns out that these uncoated or single coated filters can cause up to 9 % light loss vs multi-coated filters like hoya s-hmc or b+w mrc filters . as for polarizer effect itself , i think it 's amazing and you owe it to yourself to at least try it on a nice sunny day . ( the sky and foliage will look completely different and alive
0	i guess i really should n't complain because my husband won the camera in an office rally . but the pictures it takes are disgraceful for a samsung product every two to three pictures are blurred unrecognizably-where you ca n't even tell what you have taken . if you have found yourself among the fortunate few who actually found success with this camera thank your lucky stars . even if it is a less expensive choice versus the other cameras on the market today spend the extra money it would be worth it not to miss any family moments like my family did , on this useless piece of crap
1	i deal in major brand cameras and panasonic cameras are my personal favorite ! i 've seen people whine about the `` noise '' they make many times but have never found it to be a problem . i own the fz10 and the fx01 for my personal cameras . the fx01 is a very fast camera and takes great pics ! i love the 28mm wide lens . compared to most cameras i 've used the fx01 does a real good job of metering the light and exposing the images . i love panasonic 's solid build and reliability . they may not be as popular as canon or sony but in my opinion are every bit as good .
0	you have this camera case listed under accessories for the panasonic dmc fa20pp lumix camera . the camera does not come close to fitting in this case . the camera is 1 1/2 inches wider than the case .
1	i just bought this waterproof case in order to use my canon s410 on a scuba diving trip . i was a little nervous at first ( i could see me scrapping the camera after it got soaked to the bone ! ) , but i have to say that the waterproof case performed admirably ! i used it on 6 dives , and all of them were to depths of 80+ feet . i did not have one leak ! a word of caution -- i followed instructions and coated the seal of the camera with a fine coat of silicon gel ( just a small amount ) . i would like to think that the camera would not leak without this , but i did not want to take any chances . i would recommend this case to anyone who wants to use their canon camera on dive trips or excursions at the beach
0	i ordered this tripod , and it arrived broken . the assembly to which a camera is attached is made out of plastic . i asked for an rma order via e-mail , and they only gave me an address to mail it back to with a 'copy of the invoice . ' being lazy about mailing things back , and since it was cheap to begin with i tried repair it myself . where it broke ( the three plastic rings on the camera mount ) , it was impossible to re-glue , because of the torsion placed on those rings with any sort of pressure . even if your tripod arrives un-broken , it will likely break the first time you drop it on the camera mount from any height at all .
0	i 'm not a good photographer but use my cameras for vacation/backpacking pictures . the p3 was the fourth point and shoot nikon camera my family has owned . one of the previous cameras had the lens quit woking probably because it got some dirt in it . on the p3 the lens extends out pretty far when the camera is turned on . i accidently dropped it from about 30 '' off the ground when it was only a few days old . it landed on the back but flipped over on to the lens . the outer ring of the lens ended up crooked and would not retract or focus . i sent it back to nikon and as i expected they said the repair would not be covered by warranty . they charged $ 162.50 to fix it . mastercard has a program called `` purchase assurance '' that will hopefully cover the repair cost ! the other night i saw a commercial on tv for an olympus camera that could be dropped from 5 feet , get wet , or even frozen down to 14 degrees f and still take pictures . i wish i had seen that ad first . the nikon takes great pictures but is way too fragile for a small point and shoot camera . not buying nikon anymore .
0	i bought this item over a year ago , and it has never served for anything . once i spotted a deer and turned on the `` ir '' illuminator , and the deer ran away - not too surprising , it is actually a red light and totally visible for most animals . better use a flashlight . this is a first-generation nightscope , and has a very small range of utility : if there is a little light , the adapted human eye sees better , and if there is almost no light the device does not see either . 100 bucks is not too much of a waste , but if you are serious about nightvision you should spend about 10 times as much
1	i had this camera for 6 months and so far there have been no problems . the only flaw is that it dosent have a long battery time . it takes good pictures and short videos
1	this is a fabulous and reliable camera . feels solid . fantastic pictures . easy to operate . a new d40 has been announced over the past few days , but its lack of an lcd display and buttons to manage basic camera controls ( to reduce weight and make it more user friendly ) would still make this my recommended nikon dslr . expect prices to fall as the d40 becomes available
0	i purchased this wide angle lens for my digital camera . when i was experimenting with it taking photos inside my house , there was a dark shadow in the lower right hand portion of the photo . when i took a photo outside , there was no shadow . i went to my local camera shop to ask for help in this matter and he said i would need to adjust the white balance according to the light in the room , but he said , in reality , 'these digital cameras are really not meant for attachments ' . i did experiment with the light balance , but still had no luck in getting that dark area to disappear.the flash on the camera is not strong enough to compensate for the area the lens blocks . i returned the product .
1	the casio exilim ex-s770rd is a great camera for the price . camera is the smallest on the market and will fit in any pocket . lcd sreen is large and very clear . 7.2 mp produces great picture quality and the functions are easily accessed . as this is my first casio purchase , i am very pleased with the quality
1	when the etx-90pe works , it works very well and makes astronmomy an easy hobby to get into . let me elaborate . first , the best telescope is the one you use most often . all too frequently people buy big telescopes that are heavy to carry , and that need frequent adjustment . the little etx weighs less than 20 lbs all set up ( including tripod ) , and never needs adjustment . it encourages frequent use . second , one of the most challenging aspects of astronomy , especially for the newcomer , is finding objects to look at . if you are not familiar with the night sky and where things are located , it can get very frustrating spending up to 30 minutes just to find one object to look at ! the etx 's built in computer makes finding objects easy - just select what you want to see from a menu , and the scope will automatically point to it . the optical quality of the etx is excellent . the manufacturer , meade , does a very good job of turning out optical systems that rank with the best . some of the most rewarding objects - the moon , jupiter , saturn , and the orion nebula look wonderful through this telescope . one final positive to mention is the ease of setup . the pe models are the easiest of all telescope to get up and running . just turn on the power , press one key on the hand held computer controller , and in a few moments the telescope will start aligning itself so that it will automtically find objects for you . you do n't need to worry about where north is , or what the current date , time , and location are . now some cautions . first , the etx-90 is a small telescope , and will not show as much as a larger one . that is the trade-off with getting a portable instrument . there are larger etx models that are almost as portable , so these might be a consideration . also , understand that there will be a learning curve when using the built in computer . it 's not hard , but you need to have some patience while you learn the procedure . finally , be prepared for some quality control issues . as good as the optics are , some etx 's have some mechanical problems that require a return to the factory for warranty repair . my own etx-90pe had to go back to the factory twice . but once all the problems were fixed , it was well worth it ! on this note , you can purchase an extended warranty from the manufacturer at a reasonable price , and i would recommend doing so
1	i honestly do n't see why people would give this camera less than 4 stars . the moment i got it , i was delighted with the quality of the pictures ( except in very dark places - which is why the review gets minus 1 star ) , and by its portability . i 've dropped it , abused it , took it to countless parties , countries and it is now full of scratches and bumps ( get the camera case ! ) , and guess what : it still works as perfectly as the first day i got it . this little piece of technology is amazing , so if you 're looking for something affordable and with a great picture quality ( for us amateurs , of course ) just go for it . actually , i even took quite a few gorgeous pictures with it . i even love it and rely on it so much that i wo n't change it even now that it looks all messed up . do n't think twice . just go for it
0	the documentation is terrible . its going to take a lot of practice . if you 're just going to stick it on top your camera its fine . however i want to use it off-camera to trigger 2 x sb600s . just setting the d200 to fire a pre-flash that will trigger the sb800/masster sb600s it 's a nightmare and its not covered in any detail , in the manual . the sb800 is designed for this purpose . so why not include information on how to do this ?
1	this filter is a must have for photographers that care about their gear . it remains a cost effective tool for protecting the camera lens while serving as a great every day filter .
0	the camera operates good , but i thought it was suppose to be new . it looked a bit used and was cracked on the bottom . it does work , but unfortunately all the packageing was tossed out
0	i ordered the camera case for the canon digital elph 450 . and i was given a completely different one . prices sound great , but they do not deliver what you buy . had a bad experience with them .
1	this lens does ok at magnifying about 2x max . on full zoom , the magnification was not as sharp as without the close-up lens
1	this is a wonderful lens with great image quality , very fast , and very good build quality . no complaints
1	it is a great camera , very small and gives very good photos in most circumstances . grainy pic in dim light . go to the casio website to download the new firmware for 4gb sd card compatibility . you will get over 1500 high res photos with a 4 gb card , where outpost is selling for 5o dollars a car
0	i was deeply dissapointed in this lens hood . given that the cost is about 10 % of the cost of the lens for which it was intended ( the 70-300 is in this case ) i expected it to be of stiff durable polycarbonate . -positives- fulfills the basic function of a lens hood- prevents flare , etc . the bayonet locking system is excellent , much easier to deal with than scew-on type lens hoods . that 's about it . -negatives- the polycarbonate is so thin i half expect it to be translucent . the hood must be gripped by the base to remove it , as grippng the thin end of the hood may break it ; or at least it feels like it may break it . its very long . especially on the 70-300 which is already a long lens , this makes a fully extended zoom about a foot long . that 's pretty conspicuous . it 's very overpriced vs. generic lenses ( $ 50 vs. $ 5-10 for rubber or metal ) . i traded it in and went with a kalt rubber lens hood . 2 stars for the great bayonet design , but the rest of it is weak
1	after way too much time infront of a pc reading reviews or a camera store counter ( damn i was sick of it ) , this d80 is what i chose . bought it 2 weeks ago and then went on a 10 day trip west . after draging it everywhere i has not let me down . for the price its perfect . i 'm still working out exactly how to make it work to its potential aswell as fighting understanding of other manufacturers camera layouts in my head ) at work i have a rebel xt i bought last year as i need its compact casing . my brother has the canon d30 after he progressed from the xt and a friend on the west coast has the d200 . having experience both i still love what i chose . my biggest reason however for going again with nikon was that i already have a n6006 film camera with a lens and my hope was i could use its nikkor af 35-105mm with this camera and give myself more options . after reading lots of reviews as to whether this was possible and finally taking the lens to a shop i found it worked fine . experience in the field in the last 10 days has shown it does not work seemlessly buy that may well be me not the lens . the 2.5 inch lcd is sooo much easier to read than the rebel xt . the info read out on top is much better placed than the one above the lcd on the xt ( if obstructed in an architectural model shoot and i ca n't see through the viewfinder myself , i certainly ca n't see the info screen if its below it ) . i did n't go with the 18-135 in the end for a lens as there is a vinyetting issue at the high end which bothered me . i got a great deal for the same price at cameraland in new hampshire for the d80 and the ( d70s ) 18-70mm tried and trusted lens . fab . now need to save up and wait for the release of the 80-300 vr lens thats coming out . would love the 80-400 vr but its 3 times the price . my hardest time was finiding someone with it in stock , at a price i wanted to pay , the set up i wanted and who was n't trying to make a dodgie deal ( like some of those cheap web based places in nyc ) .it really was the hardest part of the purchase in the end . i was surprised . many people were almost reluctant to make a sale . it was wierd . parts are hard to get too apparently like a spare battery and very few places have the 18-135 lens instock either . anyway enjoy your purchase if you choose this camera . i hope it takes many great pictures for you .
0	i read other review , and decided to give it a try . as soon as i recieve it in the mail , and opened the box , i realized this was a mistake . cheap quality binocular with `` high power '' being a selling point . it came in already broken with two eye ruber pieces falling apart . you can see how the cheap glue was being used to put it in place ! it is extremly heavy to hold in hands for more than one minute for nature observation . you will be constantly ajdusting the focus . your fingers bumps with focus bar while you are holding it . indeed strap , case , lense protectors are all cheap crap , and annoying to have it all on~ ! i am taking this back , and buying made in japan `` nikon eagle view '' 100 times better . you get what you pay for~ ! ! ! ! !
1	i bought this camera for my 16 year old granddaughter and she just loves it . the pics are bright and clear and the camera is very easy to handle
1	camera arrived earlier than i expected , and was just what i wanted . very small , but versitle . large screen . very satified with my purchase
1	it is simple , handy and works well to prevent shaking your camera . but i am still doubt if this simple accessory really deserves 50 bucks ... this wired release would be the choice only if you are not a digital rebel user who has a more reasonable price option for the additional shutter button .
0	almost useless ! tried it for several days of photo shoots and finally gave up in frustration . went back to using the viewfinder without this magnifier . professional medical photographer
1	good product , probably the best digital frame in the market . drawbacks are the user interface and the difficulty to set-up the wireless connection
1	it 's a 72mm lens hood , no vigneting , works great . a must for using ef28-135 outdoors
0	good : motor drive speed . grip feel . takes nikon lenses . reacts fast to pressing the shutter release . bad : skin tone renditions a color other than skin . white balance does n't balance well . noise at anything above iso 200 , looks like 3200 . cf card door tough to open . screen fogs if you breathe when you shoot . battery cover is not part of the battery . button placement not as intuitive as on the d100 . 4.1mp allows for virtually no cropping of enlargements . dumped mine a month after i got it
1	i bought these for a trip to costa rica and used them every day . they are comfortable , easy to focus , and a great choice for the price . these are perfect for folks like me who are interested in casual use for travel , concerts , sports , etc
0	we use our videocameras to tape preschool classrooms for observations . the hope was to use the microphone to isolate conversations . to test the microphone . i went to a noisy starbucks , huge lines , moderate music and tons of conversations . i recorded on the video cameras mics , then used the zoom mic then used the gun feature . i aimed the microphone at the barista yelling out the coffee orders . in all instances , there was no difference in sound quality . i then went to the sony style store in the mall and had her open a different microphone and allowed her to install it . she read the package from a distance and then we listened to it in all three settings . we could not find any difference . i checked the camera instructions and there was no setting for the external mic . once the mic is attached and turned on , the external mic is suppose to override the on board mic . i am still insearch for a gun mic for a digital camera . many of the new camcorders with hard drives and dvd drives do not have a mic input or active interface shoe . i would rather want a mic input so that i can use a more powerful mic rather than being at the mercy of sony to create one for their shoe . overall , i am stuck . if i record something interesting i will probably have to try to enhance the audio portion while editing . ( the camera shots great video
0	i was looking for a pair of roof-prism binoculars like this , for hawk and bird watching . i had looked at swarovskis , but they were way out of my budget , nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution . these binoculars are crystal-clear , with sharp focus . the 42mm lens lets in lots of light , lots more than the 35 's i 've been using . i wear glasses and the twist- up- and -down eyecups are a blessing . there are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm , nice because i always used to lose them . for the price , these ca n't be beat
0	they tell you tha this product holds 6aa batteries , and works with the 20d 's battery grip , but when i received the item it is for a completely different product and does not work with the 20d 's bg-e2 grip . it has the product name of cpm-e3 , just as stated ... but it accepts 8 aaa batteries and does n't even come close to working with the bg-e2 .
1	good camera for the money.. picture quality excellent . used camera on recent trio to florida for spring training and colors superb.still learning the fine points and capabilties of the product . dealing through amazon exceptional . product arrived well within promised time frame . no doubt a good deal
0	i bought this for my husband for valentine 's day , so he could have photos of our new baby boy handy . unfortunately , the images appeared for one day , and then the unit stopped working . we had to send the unit back . i was very disappointed as there were many good ratings on the item .
1	great little package ! small , compact , fits easily in your pocket . took them to giants stadium to use from my end zone seat . able to see action very clearly in the opposite end of the field . easy focus for my bad eyes
1	i made the decision to buy this camera based on the many very positive user reviews . it replaces a six year old 2.1 megapixel camera . i am not disappointed . amazon 's price is very good for a 7.1 megapixel camera with a boatload of features . it is also considerably lighter in weight than the older camera . later i read reviews by experts who give it only mediocre scores for picture quality . they criticize it for no image stabilization leading to blur ( especially at higher power zoom ) and `` noise '' at film speeds over 100 asa . i set up a couple of situations in which both problems should have been very apparent . then i enlarged smaller portions of the frames to print inexpensive 4 x 6 test photos . had i printed the full frame , the print would have been larger than an 8 x 10 . i just do not see the problems the experts criticize . the colors are rich and vibrant . i really appreciate the wide range of controls . the user can choose a from a number of modes fitted to various situations . these result in a faster shutter speed , or more depth of field , or fill-in flash , etc . it is not necessary to memorize the tiny icons on the selector dial . an on-screen prompt tells you what each mode does . i also like the amount of control in the manual mode . the user can choose the asa rating , shutter speed , apeture opening , and electronic flash mode . the manual tells how to set the camera for special situations , like photographing documents . when you take the picture , the through the lens screen goes black for part of a second . you know the picture has been taken , unlike a camera with an optical finder . the camera is very intuitive for first time use . i also read most of the manual on-line while waiting for delivery and handled the camera several times in a local discount store . when i first installed the software i restarted the computer , but it repeatedly would not recognize the camera . i switched to another usb cord and it worked fine immediately . then it also began to work with the original usb cord . i had even checked for a loose connection . who knows what that was about ! one little thing to keep in mind is this . if the camera is set on continuous auto focus , you can aim and shoot . if it is set on one-time auto focus , you must press the shutter halfway down and wait for the green light before shooting , if you want sharp pictures . i do not know , but expect the difference is battery life . a 1 gb memory card can store 485 pictures at the 7.1 megapixel resolution
0	great features , right ? i just returned it after very disappointing results . here are just a few issues : 1 . if you use a tripod ( and you will need to ) , you ca n't plug in the ac adapter to save on the short battery life , because mounting it on to a tripod covers the access to the ac connection . 2 . battery life is very short . 3 . if you want to protect the lens , you will need to buy the lens adapter and then buy a protective lens . 4 . you ca n't take still photos with the flash if you are using the lens adapter because the adapter casts a shadow from the flash onto your pictures . 5 . the automatic settings are horrible . the auto focus , auto white balance , auto anything will give you the worst results if shooting indoors . 6 . you can not adjust the manual focus or anything else once you begin recording . 7 . quality is very poor when recording indoors without an enormous amount light . save your money . buy a camera with better features . i am waiting for the panasonic hdc-sd1 due in march
1	the case is beautiful leather . seems sturdy and well made . would have been more functional if the belt holder was open ended , i thought . i ordered it for my son , but found it very feminine when it arrived . i had to give it to someone else
0	this dock does not fit the r817 camera . just bought this and the hp r817 and i am very disappointed . the input for the camera is to big for the 817 . so do not buy this if you get the 817 **update** this review was written , when the dock was stated to fit the r817 , which has been changed because it does not fit
0	i loved the camera , absolutely loved it . i was using it one night and it died . i went home and put in on the charger and nothing happened . the light on the charger did n't flash or the camera did n't even go in after dying . the second time i used it , i just got back from vacation and put it on the charger . i was able to turn it on to look at the pictures . as i was looking at the pictures , it just shut off . i was unable to find a way to turn it back on or even shut the nose . i would not recommend it for this reason unless the charger you get is different than mine .
1	i purchased this for my canons500 . i have it for over a year now and it is still as good as new . good quality construction and a great look feel
0	this is a good example of the kind of scope astronomers warn beginners away from . the first red flag is the ridiculously high advertised magnification of `` 600x . '' do you know what you will see at 600x in this scope ? nothing but a dim blur . note that the objective ( main ) lens is 60mm . all telescope optics have inherent limitations ; maximum useful magnification per millimeter of aperture is about 2x . therefore , with any attempt to use this scope at magnification of over 120-140x , the increase in image size will be more than offset by breakdown , and that 's even assuming the quality of the objective lens is any good . the finder is useless ; a 6x30 is barely adequate , and this is not even that big . finding any object other than the moon will be an exercise in frustration . the 1 1/4 '' size of the eyepiece is creditable , but too high a mignification for this scope . and the field of view is in doubt , and do n't even think of using the barlow . buy this scope , and after a few outings , it will most likely sit in the attic . the review immediately before mine is correct . this is no way to get started in astronomy . in a way , it is hard to fault celestron for making and marketing this scope . their upper-tier instruments are quite good , but the big money appears to be made on mass market toys like this . in one sense the sale of these scopes subsidizes their good models . just make sure , gentle reader , to stay away from the toys . using an astronomical telescope is not like playing an mp3 file and but rather like playing a guitar . it is a learned skill . and you must do a lot of homework before you buy a telescope . buying without prior experience is like buying a car without knowing anything about driving . if you want to see the wonders of the sky , contact your local astronomy club and attend one of their star parties . the members love sharing their hobby and can set you straight as to how to get started . the best way is to learn the sky with the unaided eye and 10x50 binoculars ( decent ones are available on this website ) , then graduate to something along the lines of a 150-200mm ( 6-8 '' ) dobsonian ; celestron 's own 6 '' starhopper can be found on amazon for under $ 290 . for more information on buying telescopes , see my encyclopedic guide on amazon : `` so you want to buy a telescope .
0	they sent me wrong lens cover and said i ordered the wrong one ... ... ... .do n't think so since i got copy ... ... .poor customer service all around ... ..
1	i purchased this camera primarily as a back-up camera . but i find myself using it more and more inplace of my main camera . it is a beautiful piece of work
1	this camera delivers excellent video quality . i use it with the hot-shoe attachable microphone and the audio is quite good . i 've plugged this into my hd television and the quality is excellent . i have also had the optura xi from canon and while the build quality of the hv20 is not quite as good as that of the optura xi , the video quality is nothing short of stunning . this is a very good deal for $ 1000 . you wo n't be disappointed
1	the canon underwater housings are designed to protect your camera from the elements , whether they are sand , rain , pool , or ocean . for use on the beach , while snorkeling , or taking shots of your kids in a pool there is little or no need to worry about the buoyancy of your camera housing . if you free dive or scuba dive you do not want your camera housing floating out of your hands . these weights are an easy way to adjust the buoyancy of your housing . the kit comes with four weight plates so you can fine tune your housing 's buoyancy . i prefer a heavier setup and have added an extra plate compared to what was recommended by canon . i 'm very happy with the setup and they are very easy to use .
0	the case does not fit and the battery is incorrect for the dx759
1	the part is definitely up to nikon 's awesome standards . i bought it for future use , as i do n't currently have the lens yet , but when the price becomes affordable i will purchase it too
0	the panasonic is very compact , very stylish sexy as my wife called it , but the photos are very disappointing : they are way to noisy ! even if set on the lowest asa setting at 80asa it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100asa . the colours are good , and it does take very good videos , but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in photoshop cs2 . of course it is easy to understand why : the native resolution of the images . if one investigates such things , will notice that the panasonic is only 72 dpi , same as sony 's , canon improves this to 180 , and nikon is at 300 dpi . it is not just about megapixels folks , but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution . obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi . so before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model , do yourself a favour . try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition . set the camera for the lowest asa and the highest picture quality in jpg format , take the photos , pop the sd card into the computer , compare the images in photoshop . enlarge to full pixel size ( 100 % ) , and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself . that is what i did , since i was not very happy with the images my panasonic produced ! i had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly , and today i traded it in on a nikon p5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the leica d-lux3 10mp camera , and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store , but it was very educational for them too
0	i got this for my s70 . first off , in order to use it , you have to set the s70 to `` radio control '' ( about 9 button pushes ) . then you had better stay no further away than six feet or so ( and only in *front* of the camera-the remote does n't work from the rear ! ) . oh , and if you want to adjust your framing , forget it-the zoom is immobilized . if you need a `` cable release , '' i strongly suggest simply using the self-timer built into the camera . it gives you 2-second and 10-second settings , and you 're almost certain to have a steady tripod by that time .
0	crap . does n't work . wanted to return it but had to go out of town and lost the time period . plastic junk , never did get a good signal . the worst sony item i 've ever purchased -- and i 'm a sony fan . will still attempt to return somehow . do n't even bother
1	this handy little tool is a must have for not just nikon owners , but all camera owners . a genius of design and function , i would whole-heartedly urge every person with a camera to buy one , or many , asap
0	the main reason for buying this camera is to be able to take good pictures from far away . the quality is very poor . the unit is very bulky to carry around your neck . the sd card slot has some block in it . i was not able to even insert an sd card . all in all , not satisfied at all
1	i use my canon 10d mainly for astrophotography . most of the time , it involves keeping the camera shutter open for long periods of time , anywhere from a few minutes to tens of minutes . this ack-e2 adapter takes my worries away from monitoring battery status or a drained one , while i control the camera remotely sitting inside my house . continuous power also ensures worry free writes to its flash storage . the package included several ac power connectors which is very useful while travelling . amazon provides a wide range of items to choose from .
1	this scope is one of the best gen 1 units on the market . at 36 lines/mm , it has just about the best resolution . most other units only have 24 lines/mm . the illuminator is bright ( almost too bright ) , uniform , and has a crisp edge . it could be a bit larger , however , so that it would fill the field of view . note that if you remove the eyepiece or lens , ( to put on the riflescope eyepiece or change the magnification ) you will break the seal and the unit will no longer be waterproof . do n't bother with the ir flashlight . it 's output is actually less than the built-in illuminator and it is far from uniform .
0	i purchased this camera and took it to the beach . the photos were so bad , i threw them away . the images were all washed-out and blurry . also , the film advancing mechanism is very tricky , so several of the pictures i took overlapped each other . i 've used other disposable cameras before that would n't let you take a picture until the film had been fully advanced to the next frame . with this camera , i advanced the film until the mechanism stopped , and the camera allowed me to take another picture . unfortunately , the film had n't advanced fully and the next picture partially overlapped the previous picture that i had taken . what a waste of money this camera was ! thankfully , i had also taken my digital camera , so i still had some good pictures of my trip : )
1	my search for a semi pro digicam made me do a lot of research and after i shortlisted a few models i had to find the best deal . amazon helped me get that deal and today when i look at the performance of the camera so far.. i am amazed ... the camera was bound to be good but a special thanks to amazon.com for helping me get one at a gr8 price
0	the camera ( canon s-80 ) barely fits in the case and there is no room for even an extra storage card , much less a second battery pack or the charger . i ended up using my old tamrac case that has an extra zippered pouch for accessories . total waste of $ $ $
1	this 10-20mm lens is equivalent to a 15-30mm in a 35mm film camera , so it 's an ultra-wide lens at 10mm . i was pleasantly surprised at how sharp the images are from this lens ; and it 's rectilinear , which means that straight lines in real life remain straight in the photograph . it is a well-made lens , made with high-grade materials . what this lens excels at is when you want to photograph sweeping landscapes , close-quarters interior photography , and in architectural photography where you do n't mind the exaggerated converging lines that an ultrawide produces . personally , that 's what i like , so i 'm very happy with this sigma 10-20mm
1	i enjoy the convenience of a point and shoot digital camera . my minolta dimage x ( about 15 % small in size than this camera ) had reached the end of its useful life , having been around for about 5 years . the minolta had a 3/4 '' screen on the back . ( this one has a 2.5 '' screen- great colors ) the best feature i liked about my old camera was the fact that there was not a telescoping zoom lens . i do n't like the fact that a part that needs to move so often has the possibility to get gummed up and dirty . therefore , i was excited that this camera had an internal zoom . tonight i was at a bulls game , in the 300 section ( nose bleed ) , and was able to zoom in and get a individual photo of kirk hinrich . the 3x optical zoom is incredible , but more so incredible is the digital zoom . i was also able to zoom into the jumbotron , and it looked as crisp as if i was taking the photo directly . action shots are great . low light shots are great ! it is exactly what i was looking for
1	i bought the rebel xt w/ the 18-55 lens exactly 18 hours before the xti was introduced , but that 's another story . as this is my first dslr , i was blown away by the results . but after the initial euphoria , there is always room for improvement . my first choice was the 28-200 , favoring the longer zoom over the is , but i found this one used at penn camera and got a deal on it and a 380ex flash , so the decision was made for me . i like the zoom range , it 's great for framng portraits . if i need wider angle , i still have the kit lens . i wo n't make the usual complaints about the herky-jerky zoom ring or the rackety extension tubes , as i was prepared for this by these reviews before i ever saw the lens . i 'm no expert on sharpness , and still trying to get myself dialed in , but my shots so far look pretty sharp to me . i have no `` l '' lenses to compare to , nor would i make the comparison if i did . in my somewhat uninformed opinion , this is a great step up from the kit lens . this is a lens a working guy can afford and most likely get great results with . being a working guy , i 'm extremely happy with it so far , and glad i made the purchase .
0	i love my nikon coolpix 5900 however , the lens failed in less than one year . service took 6 weeks to repair . the lens failed again after less than 10 days after repair . why is the lens failing to open again ? i absolutely hate the inconvenience of returning this item again for service although i do have a paid plan for it . why ca n't warranty be fast , local and competent
0	they say 100 % compatible but is not , because is not an info ion-litio , so is not a eqivalent battery , dos n't work . do n't expend your money on this stupid batter
1	this camera is very similar to the fuji f30 , but has face detection ( fd ) that autofocuses on faces in a photo . great for taking pictures of yourself , or for snapshots you do n't have time to compose . excellent quality photos in dim light . at 3200 iso , photos are washed out and noisy , but still good for capturing an image you would otherwise miss . option to limit iso to 1600 , or to 400 . camera will use any speed up to the limit . 400 iso is extremely good . as good as my canon digital rebel xti . usual modes i never use ( flower , landscape , etc . ) , but one unique mode i use all the time : no flash/flash . the camera takes a picture without flash up to 3200 iso , and then takes a picture with flash immediately after . usually takes less than one second to capture both images . no flash does n't surprise anyone and ruin the candid shot , while the following flash guarantees you 'll get the image , even if the `` warm glow of candlelight '' is ruined . i always have the camera set to this mode . uses xd cards , which i hate , but if you buy a 1 gb card you 'll be able to take 400 - 500 photos without ever needing to change the card . also , battery life is unbelieveable ! fully charge the camera over several hours , and you 'll be able to take 400 photos , half with flash , before the battery is drained . fuji-brand underwater housing is optional , watertight to 40m ( 121 ft. ) camera comes with underwater setting to intensify non-blue colours , and still keep the intense blue of the water . literally *every* diver should have one of these cameras . i recommend this camera without hesitation . there simply is n't anything else like it on the market .
0	quite unsatisfied with this product and will be returning the 2 i purchased as gifts . in fact , the recipients asked me to return them . main reason , in order for it to be `` portable '' it requires a special battery that you can only buy from the manufacturer for an additional $ 30 . i already spent $ 100 , not planning on spending more money . i think photoco needs to rethink their product and improve customer satisfaction .
0	conclusions : to start from the end i got the xacti ca6 , tested it and returned it . here are the pros and cons . pros - 1 . very small , just put in your pocket and go 2 . easy and simple controls 3 . super fast start up from sleep mode 4 . good video quality when lighting conditions are good 5. the ability to take stills while in video mode ( i had no issue with the video pausing , no way around that ) 6 . you get video and 6mp stills in one device for a reasonable price 7 . sd card that records for a long time 8 . easy transfer to computer for editing cons - 1 . indoor video unacceptable , although the video is brighter the ones my sony digicam takes , it is extremely grainy ( more so than my sony digicam videos ! ! ) 2 . super slow zoom when in video mode 3 . in good lighting it is very difficulty to take stills that are not blurry ( especially when trying to capture a kid on the move , for scenery it might be ok ) 4 . in low lighting stills are unusable ( even at short distance ) due to a very , very weak flash . 5 . red eye almost every time the flash works 6 . strap is a joke 7 . no lens cover so in short , on paper this camera is great , i love having the sd format rather than tape or dvd , the size is amazing and the ability to take both video and stills at a high resolution is priceless . but ... .the stills are useless both in good and bad lighting ( see above ) and the video is usable only if shot in very good lighting conditions ( for a new dad that shoots many videos indoors this is impractical ) . this camera is only for outdoor people who shoot in good lighting conditions and have a very very steady hand ( for taking stills ) . for almost everyone else it is not adequate , i will have to compromise on having both a dedicated still camera and a minidv camcorder ( going for the elura 100 ) ... .. ya , i know people told me that this was the best option beforehand , i was hoping to prove them wrong ... . ; - (
1	very well made . once you are holding it you will feel the price was quite low for a product this solid and well designed .
1	if you do n't need the speed or ca n't afford the expensive 85mm f1.4 nikkor lens or both , then this lens may be the right one for you . it took nikon a while to produce a superb compact 85mm lens , but this time they finally got it right . without a doubt , this is a fine portrait lens for photographing head-and-shoulder portraits ( the only lens which is optically better is nikon 's legendary 105mm f2.5 nikkor lens , and its close optical twin , the 105mm f2.8 micro nikkor. ) . since the 105mm f2.5 nikkor lens does n't have an autofocus version , then this might be the perfect moderate telephoto lens for owners of nikon autofocus slr cameras . regardless , this lens has a well-earned reputation for excellent contrast and resolution
1	when i bought a digital camera , i already knew that i would need rechargeable batteries for it . what i did n't realize was how quickly the camera would eat the supplied alkalines . i had taken barely a dozen pictures before they were drained to the point where the camera would no longer operate ! so i looked for a set of rechargeable batteries and a charger and quickly settled on this one because of previous experience with monster cable 's products . it performs better than advertised . the initial charge may have taken 3 hours , but subsequent charges have been much quicker . i have yet to drain these batteries to the point where they wo n't operate the camera . the charger itself is an attractive unit for an appliance , and has an led indicator that lights up red for charging and changes to green to indicate fully charged . it is compact enough to fit comfortably in the camera bag and the plug folds into the back of it . i have had good service from it and can highly recommend this charger
0	it is hardly one month old and the pockets on the sides have already started coming off . it is not the stuff that i expected froma brand name like panasonic
0	this product is worthless . you 'd be better off keeping your money and buying a good case at a store . overpriced , cheap , plastic-y rip-off . no `` deluxe '' here
1	this lens is amazing . nothing escapes it . it 's like a black hole . clearly the best lens i have ever owned . it 's like the lidless eye of sauron from the lord of the rings . it is heavy and requires rethinking how you hold the camera . it comes with a beautiful case , a hood , and a tripod mount on the lens . believe me you will need it . i took a few photos of my son from 250 feet away and they look great . i will now get to work reading the small manual . it has 2 focal settings and 2 stabilizing settings . wow !
0	hey this is for everyone buying cameras over the world out of the united states , i have a problem with my camera and i do n't have anyone to help , i 've been trying some help in amazon 's help area but they just have thousands of links but any simple email where i can ask for some help , i do n't really understand why is this site so well known on customer service , but i just can not communicate with no one in the company to ask anything , i 'm just mad about this , if anyone can help me to contact amazon or fujifilm please post an email or whatever cause there 's no such a thing like help in the help area . i need to repair my lcd monitor of my camera , it 's really fragile , so if you 're still thinking on buying in this site or even buying something from fujifilm , do n't do it , they do n't care about the customer satisfaction at all
1	there are no professionals or would-be professional photographers in our house . instead we are ametuers who love to get fun shots of our friends and family . we 're not particularly interested in birds , flowers , bugs , race cars , etc . we want to catch our kids doing what they love best ; football , basketball , swimming , band , golf ... my only advantage is that i am very experienced with adobe photoshop , which lets me creatively salvage some less-than-perfect shots . this year our son is a high-school senior . instead of buying an expensive portrait package , we voted to spend the money on a canon digital rebel xt kit ( with lens ) . we choose one extra zoom lense ( the 75-300mm f4-5.6 iii usm telephoto ) for up-close action sports shots . we did n't chose the is lens because it was out of our price range . we are having great fun with this camera and lens . we have already taken a variety of football game pictures using the 'basic ' sports setting on the camera ( burst mode at full zoom ) . they are great - crisp and clear . these have been taken in full sun . we realize that we 'll have to get a little more creative when we are taking pictures in lower light situations . but i think we can do it . i would recommend this lens for anyone who just wants to capture some fun shots . they might not be professional quality , but they are just what we wanted
0	i read the reviews and thought i 'd still give it a try . after one battery charge , i was `` lucky '' enough to have a defective unit - the camera would n't start again after the first charge . my observations from that first short use were : - quality of pictures was very poor ( my pentax optio 4mp camera takes better quality photos ) -- very disapointing for a 6mp camera . - the flash was generally useless , and actually hurt quality - the camera was very uncomforable if you do n't have very small hands . my wrist hurt after using it for 20 minutes . - the video was ok , but the focus was very slow ( and noisy ) . - i had the same problem as several others -- that the camera died shortly afer getting it ( shows very poor quality ) . all-in-all do n't waste your money . you can get a much better camera at a lower price
1	the sony cybershot is a great camera . the colors and the features are amazing . is very easy to use . the only thing i dont like about the camera is the zoom in and out button . if you zoomed in you wont be able to zoom out .
1	this is panasonic 's entry-level camcorder , but it 's packed with useful features , like good image quality , 12 lux sensitivity , and a whopping 30x optical zoom . i think it 's perfect for casual travel videography as well as for shooting entries to the `` america 's funniest video '' show . it 's fairly easy to use and the build quality is solid . a good optional accessory to get is a spare battery . you never know if the battery might run out at the most inopportune time , so be sure to pick up a backup one . given the recent dell recall of 4.1 million laptops due to battery fire , you should get a genuine panasonic liion battery designd specifically for this model . do n't put your life or your loved one 's at risk . the reviewer named `` hung '' got it totally wrong ( or was just plain lying ) . the gs29 does come with ieee1394 firewire ( aka i.link ) so you can download your videos quickly to your pc ; if your pc does n't already have an ieee1394 port , you can get a pci ieee1394 card for $ 30 or less . you can use windows movie maker , included with windows me and xp , to edit your videos and export them to cds or dvds .
0	i bought this monopod about 3 weeks ago after reading the reviews here . i 'm not sure if i got a defective unit but i 've had these problems from the gitgo : -i noticed the 2 lower sections will not open and close smoothly , they would get stuck about 2-3 inches from the lock and you 'd need force to expand/retract them . very interestingly , if the section right above the one i 'm trying to expand/retract is unlocked then the operation is smooth and flawless ! -the ballhead does not support my nikon d80 and lightest lens ( 18-55mm ) a less than 2 lbs combo , which is much lighter than the 4.4 lbs weight limit indicated in the specs . the camera just slumps in one direction or another regardless of how hard i try to make sure the ballhead is locked tightly . again , it might have been a defective unit , but i thought i 'd point my observations out anyway . i wanted to buy this from amazon , it was n't in stock , it was sitting in my shopping cart and when it became available amazon bumped the price to $ 40+ , so i went elsewhere and got it for $ 30 .
0	i guess i really should n't complain because my husband won the camera in an office rally . but the pictures it takes are disgraceful for a samsung product every two to three pictures are blurred unrecognizably-where you ca n't even tell what you have taken . if you have found yourself among the fortunate few who actually found success with this camera thank your lucky stars . even if it is a less expensive choice versus the other cameras on the market today spend the extra money it would be worth it not to miss any family moments like my family did , on this useless piece of crap
1	i really enjoy my photosmart r725 . it 's small , easy portable , takes wonderful photos , and is very versatile in terms of settings . i just have one thing i do n't like about it , and that 's the fact that there is no viewfinder . there is an lcd screen on the back which acts as a viewfinder , but it 's hard to see in bright sunlight , and i 'm afraid that it will eventually become scratched beyond use . for now , it 's great but i 'm not sure how it will hold up for the long run . at the same time , it 's not spendy , so it might be worth it
0	i bought this for my 9 year old son to take movies and edit on the pc . it worked for about 2 days before there was no image from the lens to either the lcd or the viewfinder . i could see other information on the lcd , such as the date , time , menu , but no image from the screen . i called samsung and that is where it is now for repairs . a check of the web indicated that this problem is well documented . i did try to install the software that came with the camera , but that did not go to well either . i will retry when i get a working camera again .
0	this camera is a decent enough camera , compact , easy to use and takes good quality video and still pictures and the battery life is excellent . the battery that comes with it is good for a couple of hours continuous recording and the tapes only last for one hour . i acquired a second battery that is good for 240+ minutes so i never worry about running out of juice . i have only two complaints really , one minor and one major . the minor complaint is the fiddly little controls on the touch screen lcd viewfinder . i find i need to use my reading glasses to see what i 'm doing . the major complaint is transfering video to my computer via the ilink cable ( not supplied ) . i have never persuaded it to work . by browsing various camera fora on the web i am finding a complaint identical to mine with this model in particular as well as other sony models . the computer will recognize the camera in usb mode ( for capturing still pictures from the memory stick ) but does not see it at all when plugged in via ilink ( firewire/ieee 1394 ) . all indications are that my firewire port and cable are perfectly ok. sony tech support , both web chat based and phone , have no clue and because i am out of warranty it will cost a flat $ 210 to send it in and have them take a look at it . if all you want to do is connect the camera to your tv to playback the video you take , it 's a good camera . if video capture an editing is what you have in mind , buyer beware . because of this , i can only give the product 2 stars , other wise it would be a 5 . update : i installed a new firewire pci card on my computer and using a new cable tried the video capture again . i also tried the camera on my neighbor 's mac ( on the theory that if a mac wo n't recognize it you really know you have a problem ) . the computer still wo n't recognize the camera . this camera has been used very little and definitely not abused . it was probably defective right out of the box and it appears to be a common problem . if you buy this , make sure you test all of its capabilities as soon as you get it . do n't wait like i did because i 'm out of warranty and it will cost me to get the problem fixed
1	this is my first digital picture frame , so i do not have anything to compare it against . i am generally very happy with this product - it is very easy to use , and i am happy with the resolution and the picture quality . the only downside to this frame is that the instruction manual is not helpful at all , and as one other reviewer noted , i had to learn how to do things by trial and error . i also do not like that when you make changes to the layout - rotating or deleting images , it is not `` saved '' to the memory card and so you need to make the changes each time . however , i like this product enough to buy more of these for the grandparents this next christmas
1	i 've had it for several weeks now and it seems like a great camera . i am still learning new features . i would highly recommend it
1	i bough this waterproof case for a trip to st. thomas over christmas . the photographs that we took came out perfect . the flash diffuser worked well , by eliminating the air bubbles that normally are captured with underwater cameras . make sure that you set up your camera to the underwater mode so that it automaticlaly adjusts your color balance . the only problem that i had was since it is so compact , i often accidently would move the switch to movie mode . this ruined a few photographs , but also made a great movie of a sea turtle coming up for air . i know that it was expensive , but much cheaper than buying a new camera or buying multiple disposable underwater cameras and having x-ray machines fog up the pictures
1	we canoe/kayak down various rivers and creeks . i wanted a way to take my $ 1500 camera on the water without fear of damaging it . the sports pack is completely water proof ( up to 7m ) . i 've submersed the case in a test and in a real-life situation and the camera stayed dry . the case does not cause any noticeable reduction in picture quality . it is relatively simple to operate and assemble . you have only the basic functions of the camera while in the case , so you need to change any setting for the camera before putting it in the case and advanced camera features are not able to be used . my only concern is the scratch resistance of the plastic over the lens area . so far i have n't had any problems but i 've only taken on the river for about 30 hrs . all told , i 'm very pleased and if you plan on filming in or near water i would recommend this case
0	the only reason i am giving this 1 start is becuase of amazon 's poor service , otherwise i would give 5 stars for the product . i placed this order more than 30 days ago . amazon still has not shipped the item so i cancelled my order and placed it with j if amazon did not have the item in stock , they should have stated on their web site or at least communicated with me that there will be a delay in shipping
0	this camera is garbage . it was a disappointment for my son and a waste of my money . it was hard to figure out , it took lousy pictures , it burned through batteries . avoid this camera . i just wish i could give it zero stars
0	the en-el3a is a works fine and with no problems . however , amazon is misleading its customers by putting a lower price from a partner company as the primary price of the item . amazon should market the item at it 's price and show the partner price as an option unless the item can only be obtained from the partner . the 2 stars is not for the item but for amazon 's misleading advertisment
1	i bought this camera for my 80 year old mother because i knew that if she was going to try digital photography , it had to be easy ! the printer dock is simple for her to use to transfer snapshots of her cat to her computer and email them to her friends . i have used the older cx-7300 , ( very similar camera ) for backpacking for years and it has never failed under harsh conditions . the lack of optical zoom is a plus for me ; less to break . the c530 is more compact , has better resolution , and still has the option of using aa batteries when the rechargables die . if you want simple digital snapshots , you will love this little camera
1	after much research i finally found the binoculars that fit my every need . the price was right , the delivery was right on schedule , and the product is excellent
0	it 's not an item to write home about . final picture quality is usually ok but not spectacular . the wi-fi works some days , mostly not . if i 'd known then what i know now it would still be on the shelf or in the hands of some other poor purchaser .
1	i have a wall hung plasma tv with speakers from my surround system mounted on either side . i was able to locate all the receivers in another room for a super clean installation . the hot pro ir target is very sensitive ! ! initially i had the hot pro `` box '' too close to another tv and the blue indicator light was always on . if it 's glowing , you need to move something . once the indicator is n't lit but flashes when you use your remote , it works flawlessly
0	i got for christmas , it was easy to use but only lasted 1 day then the screen does not turn on , , , stay away from this one !
1	this is a fabulous gift for grandparents if you preload the pictures . just be aware that the customer support folks are not that knowledgeable , probably since the product is new . do n't bypass their software to load the pix if you 're transferring from your pc to the frame - their software reduces the memory needed for each one . and even though the software for different size frames is labelled the same , it is not compatible and you can only have one version installed on your pc at a time
1	photos printed are very sharp . some difficulty with printer cartidge and as expensive as they are , you ca n't afford to have much difficulty . good for craft times with the kids
1	this is a great lens for star fields . it is about the least expensive lens canon makes and also one of the fastest . the focus was sharp to the corners without coma . see my photo of a portion the milky way . this was obtained with a 30sec exposure with a rebel xt on an inexpensive clock drive sitting on a picnic table
1	the digital rebel is the most amazing camera i 've ever owned . my previous camera was a canon a90 and i loved using all the features on it [ great camera ! ] . i decided recently that maybe i should graduate to a slr because i was starting to get more creative with my photography . i spent a great deal of time researching cameras and finally decided on the digital rebel . after a few months of owning it i still am amazed . the image quality is fantastic , it 's quick and responsive , and every day using it i learn a little more . it 's the perfect intro slr camera for me because everything makes sense and it 's easy to learn . i 've gotten amazing shots that i could never dream of getting with a point and shoot . if you are finding yourself wanting a little more than a point and shoot , go for this camera , you wont be sorry .
1	this lens hood designed specificaly for the coolpix 5700 is a must-have accessory . it does more than just protecting the lens , which it certainly does , esp . for those busy moments when you might bump the front of the camera on something solid . ( do n't forget murphy 's law . ) but the lens hood can also improve your picture quality . as with slr lenses , the hood prevents light from entering the camera lens from the sides and enhances the sharpness and contrast of the picture . this is especially true outdoors when the light is diffused ( scattered ) . just use this all the time ( see exception below ) and your pictures out of the 5700 will be at their best ( all other factors being equal , of course ) . the only times you should *not* use the hood is when you use the built-in flash on the 5700 , esp . indoors when the flash is used as the main lighting source . the hood will block the flash and cast an ugly shadow on your nearby subject . even outdoors when you use the built-in flash for fill-in light , you should remove the hood first to avoid uneven exposure . get the hood today to improve your pictures and protect your camera
1	this case is extremely stylish , high grade leather , with a very strong magnetic closure and a useful belt clip . highly recommended for sony t10 and other camera models listed in description
0	half of my pictures are out of focus making it useless . should have sent it back
0	i 've had this camera just over a year ( figures ) and it has gone completely bonkers on me . sometimes it works and other times it puts black lines across the screen making it useless . you never know when you turn it on whether it will work or not -- making it completely unreliable . keep in mind that this camera was used almost entirely inside for my business , so it was n't abused , dropped , thrown in the bottom of a purse , etc . it was treated very carefully and probably only shot about 2,000 pictures total . frankly , i 'm kind of glad it broke so that i have an excuse to replace it . here 's why : 1 . takes beautiful still shots , but forget about any kind of action . it takes too long between shots to get good action . it also blurs nearly all the action shots i 've ever taken , regardless of what mode it 's in . 2 . the red-eye is aweful . it should do better . i doubt that i 'll ever buy another canon
1	i had viewed concert photos taken with the s2 from a number of different photographers and they absolutely took my breath away . saw the output of other cameras in comparison and they did n't even come close . i was using the canon a80 prior and while i was happy with it , my first round of photos with the s2 proved to be most impressive . while you can use this as a point and shoot , this is a camera that you should spend some time learning so that you can get the most from it . and although the s3 is the latest version of the camera , i 'm not sure you get that much more for the money
0	i have two 8 '' picture frames that are other brands , and they are great and i use them for open houses all the time ! i got this one as a gift from a friend , and it is terrible ! ! the instructions are difficult to understand . the wide screen makes everyone in the picture look fat and distorted ! this is a weird size and i am not happy at all ! ! i do n't recommend it
0	beware of poor cs policy at jvc . they recently let me down when it was obvious the camera was poorly designed and built . they were not interested in even trying to help . i hate it when companies only care about their profits
0	so this was my first digital camera , got it last july for my birthday . i go to a lot of concerts , so i needed a camera that could take pictures in not good light and take pics of moving subjects . well , two days after i got it , i was at a festivale watching my fav band perform and the the screen went white . it would still take pics , only you couldnt see them . after changing the batteries and turnign it off and on , it went back to normal . alarmed , i called samsung and they told me the couldnt do anythign until it was white again . it only did it a couple of times after that so i never called again . but that was only one thing wrong with it . this is a horrible camera for concerts , the pictures are always blurry . shoot , even when im at my house the pics still come out blurry sometimes . tuesday i went to see my fav band again , and the dumb thing goes white . it woudnt stop , no matter how many times i turned it off and on again . now the flash is broke and i 'm ready to throw it against the wall . you ca n't trust this camera . you never know when it will take good pics or bad pics.i wouldnt even consider buying this camera for a minute !
1	the ergonomics : perfect . the d200 is not completely rubber-encased . there 's rubber where your hands need to hold it , and plastic where your hands rarely touch it . the hand grip is comfortable and nicely concave where the tips of your fingers can dig in . the battery door and the memory card door are made of plastic , and hinge-pinned . a simple slide latch opens the battery door ... .and some have warned the latch could be easily ( accidentally ) tripped . the memory card door latch , however , uses a more secure 45 degree pivoting latch . usb 2 and video out/dc-in doors are made of flexible rubber , and these doors extend into the body of the camera as the hinges themselves . the english language operating manual is a work of art . each operating concept is alpha ' numerically numbered at the pictoral diagram , and to the page where the function is explained in perfect english . the reader will quickly catch on to how this well thought out manual is organized . i like the depth of field preview , the mirror lock-up , and the multiple-exposure capability . the continuous servo autofocus does a better job than any human at following and focusing on any moving object . if you have the old manual-focus , film-based nikon slr lenses from the '70 's and '80 's , except for a few rare exceptions , will fit on the d200 . all these positive attributes remind me of the best , most highly-evolved film camera slr 's . no wonder so many photographers have been won over to digital media .
0	men of a certain age will remember how , when we were kids and this was played on tv in the early 80s , we thought it was so cool when a huge army of police officers fired so many shots into a house that it eventually collapsed , and when a bus was shot full of holes by an even larger army of cops . but those two over-the-top scenes are all this movie has going for it . the other action scenes are pretty silly and unbelievable , especially scenes involving a sniper in a helicopter , and atop a parking structure , both of whom were in `` ca n't miss '' positions and missed anyway . moreover , if you know anything about law the plot is beyond silly . it involves eastwood being sent from phoenix to las vegas to escort a witness being extradited back to arizona for a trial . the witness will testify about bad behavior on the part of the phoenix police commissioner , and a corrupt assistant district attorney is involved with the commissioner in a coverup . assuming a material witness can be extradited , which i doubt , the crime appears to have been committed in vegas , so it would tried in vegas , not phoenix . and if the ada prosecuting the case was corrupt and wanted to cover for the commissioner , he could just dismiss the case , and there would be no need to murder the witness . the idea that they would want to draw attention to the case by having 200 cops line up and try to assassinate the witness is beyond ridiculous . in sum , the plot and the action were both absurd , and the only interesting scenes were the crazy firepower overkill at the house and on the bus . but those two scenes probably ca n't carry the entire movie for the average viewer .
1	in this movie based on a true story we see jerry stahl played by ben stiller . jerry is a geek hollywood scriptwriter who turns out junk for sitcoms although he thinks he is shakespeare by his admiration of his own writing . jerry has it all- a hollywood mansion , liz hurley , a cool car and yet he decides to throw it all away for some heroin . jerry 's heroin habit costs $ 6,000 a week but he is only earning $ 5000 ( ! ! ! ) per week . one does not need a phd . in advanced mathematics to realize this this spells trouble . jerry eventually gets clean with the help of maria bello and then he wrote his story in a best selling book . one can only hope that his new fortune does not lure him back into the drug scene . i give this sorry excuse of a movie 5 stars because it has maria bello in it although i still ca n't figure out why she finds jerry the geek so interesting . his story is the same as any street junkie.they all look the same to me when they are injecting heroin into their veins on the street
0	movie boring ... story drags ... barely any action ... if story drags should have atleast good story to keep interest but it had nothing ... booo
1	this is a fantastic movie ! the acting is superb , and it keeps you guessing until the end . nicole kidman deserved her oscar
1	this was a great history movie , and in excelent condition at arrival , thank yo
1	this is definately worth the price . i cried and laughed watching the perfect story of chi and hedeki . beautiful animation , great story line
1	if you are a ghits sac fan this dvd is a must , series wise the dvd contains 4 new episodes and the tachikoma stories are back as well , in fact the tachikoma 's are now back in action in the series too . graphic wise , 2nd gig drops the funny pastel look of the first season and returns to its dark look as it was in the first movie , the cg is allot more fine-tuned and the action is awesome ! ! ! , the opener has also improved significantly for the series ! ! ! , sound wise the series is awesome as usual 5.1 dts japanese 5.1 dts english , with stereo for both and there are english subtitles if you chose to run it with japanese audio . overall they squealed sac season 1 perfectly , this not a series to miss if you 're a shell fan !
1	with king creole , love me tender and stay away joe - jailhouse rock 1957 is elvis presley at his best . he declined the old musical tradition of mgm and insisted on a contemparary look - especially how the choreography should be executed . in this film we see elvis presley at his very best . he was a stunning actor - much more prefer him to james dean ... it`s a shame he made more or less 33 forgettable films ... . only a handful stands out and jailhouse rock is the best . it isn`t a classic - it isn`t even great . but we have elvis - the king - and that`s the best there is : - ) )
1	wow , i just viewed `` spun '' the other night and i thought this movie was outrageous . this is sort of a guilt-pleasure movie but you want to take shower afterwards . `` spun '' has an impressive cast of recognized actors . the film is , essentially , about a few days in the lives of a group of drug addicts . there is the cook ( mickey rourke , he truly makes this story worth watching ) , who makes the drug ( speed ) and sells it to spider mike ( john leguizamo ) , a dealer with a junkie girlfriend , cookie ( mena suvari , looking infinitely less attractive than she did in `` american beauty '' ) . one of his clients is ross ( jason schwartzman ) , who does a lot of favours for the cook and his girlfriend , nikki ( brittany murphy ) . i was surprised at how funny the film was at times . it does n't drown us in anti-drug messages , nor does it become one of those , equally tedious , drug films where you feel like the sober driver at a drunken party . the humour is dark , certainly , but funny nevertheless . a lot of it comes from a subplot about frisbee , patrick fugit , who is caught by a couple of tv policemen ( peter stormare and alexis arquette ) and is told he will be let off if he helps them get spider-mike . i will only say of the resulting sequence that he does it with all the subtlety of an undercover policeman with his badge stuck to his forehead . this is a film with a lot of energy , that seems , like its characters , not entirely sure where it is going , but determined to get there , and quickly . although i am sure it is boring to be surrounded by people on speed when you are sober , this film almost makes you feel like you are on speed too . the director , jonas Ã¯Â¿Â½kerlund , has directed music videos in the past , and it shows in his impatient filming style , as he plays around with animation , speeded-up camerawork and such like . i 'm not recommending the film for its style though , although i am sure it is the best way this material could get to the screen . i am recommending it because i liked the main characters , which i think will stick in my head for much longer than the animated sex scenes or the split screens . i can imagine an entire film about the cook and nikki , or spider mike and cookie , or even just ross , who absentmindedly keeps leaving a girl handcuffed to his bed for hours/days . what makes `` spun '' better than those hypothetical films is that it puts the characters into their own little community , and we feel as if we are watching their everyday , speeded up , sleepless lives . simply amazing .
0	i had high hopes for this movie , marlon brando , robert deniro , and edward norton , how could i go wrong with this movie with a cast like that ? despite the cast this movie sinks under a terrible script . the film is often tedious and the characters never seemed very realistic to me . this was a poorly contrived and at times silly film . the tension never really builds even though the filmmakers try . embarassing for all involved . i only give it two stars to be nice to the cast
1	'torzÃ³k ' ( 'abandoned ' ) is a brilliant hungarian film written and directed by ÃrpÃ¡d sopsits that takes us back to hungary of 1960 when the oppressive communist rule altered the lives of everyone , especially children . the quality of the film is absolutely first rate from story to acting to filming to scoring . it may be a tough film to absorb and certainly not for the easily offended , but it is a perfectly honed gem of a film that deserves wide audience exposure . Ãron ( tamÃ¡s mÃ©szÃ¡ros ) is a young lad whose life seems warm at first until suddenly a disease of vision impairment attacks his mother and his parents divorce : the mother is somewhere in a hospital and the father ( sÃ¡ndor gÃ¡spÃ¡r ) beats the boy and eventually turns him over to a rigid orphanage for boys run by cruel taskmasters . Ãron undergoes initiation tactics by his fellow orphans but despite the beatings he is strong enough to survive . he is befriended when he has his nightmares about his mother 's blindness by his friend atilla ( szabolcs csizmadia ) and the two bond emotionally and physically . in this bleak atmosphere a little light comes from the beautiful young housekeeper anya ( krisztina somogyi ) but even her contributions are compromised by the cruelty of the staff . there is one 'teacher ' in the orphanage school , nyitrai ( lÃ¡szlÃ³ gÃ¡lffi ) who has been reduced to his position as an 'imprisoned one ' by the government and his sadness is offset by his playing his cello and studying his beloved astronomy . nyitrai offers Ãron solace and introduces his 'fellow traveler ' to the glory of the stars , giving Ãron a map of the heavens that Ãron cherishes - his window to a world beyond the dark confines of his prison-like orphanage . he gradually wins over his fellow orphans and when nyitrai , in the pit of depression for his life situation and the cruelty of the orphanage and the government , hangs himself . this horrid incident drives Ãron to organize an escape from the orphanage , an event that is ultimately fractured with a death for which Ãron feels responsible . and the end of the film fades into the many possibilities that event could trigger . the atmosphere created by the stunning cinematography by pÃ©ter szatmÃ¡ri defines the darkness that represents the orphanage well but also suggests the darkness in hungary of that period . the musical score by pÃ©ter fejcsik , tamÃ¡s gÃ¶rgÃ©nyi , ferenc toma , and balÃ¡zs winkler is some of the most beautiful composed for the screen , making tremendously effective use of the cello and lower strings . in all , this is a brilliant piece of filmmaking , acted with depth in every role , and unveiling a portion of history and tragedy too often pushed to the background of our books . highly recommended . grady harp , march 06
0	the virgin suicides starring kristen dunst , josh hartnett , kathleen turner and james woods lacks depth and a convincing storyline . this film is directed by sofia coppola ( lost in translation ) , i really tried to like this movie but i was fooling myself , you would think this movie would be a hidden gem because of the coppola legacy but just because your father is frances ford coppola does n't mean you belong in the same category as best director of all-time . sometimes magic does not stirke twice . how can all five sisters end up killing themselves , their homelife was n't that unbearable , a lot of parents are religious , but that does n't mean you 'll wind up with thoughts of impending suicide . kristen dunst just gets on my nerves , her acting is the same in every film . do n't believe the hype , the virgin suicides is not a groundbreaking , poetic film
1	tom cruise gives an excellent performance as imf agent ethan hunt , who is framed for murder after the death of his imf team.together with the help of two other imf agents , hunt sets out to find the real murderer.cornered most of the movie and set to his limits , hunt and team are hard put to catch the assailants.it all leads to a final showdown on a speeding bullet train with an unlikely foe.hard core action and awesome intellegence meet in this exhillirating action drama by filmmaker brian depalma
0	this movie is so bad . it is just about a annoying valley girl blonde who is rich and has tons of friends and who has no real problems . the only people who like this movie are the ones who wished they were the main character , a pea brained airheaded ditz who has no redeeming qualities . the movie tries hard to invent new `` teen speak '' with tons of lame catch phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who liked the movie so much , they tried to sound like the shallow empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the movie 's fans live the life nowhere close to cher 's and look nothing like her but they want to pretend . the movie hits you with these lame catch phrases every 15 seconds , desprate to beat you over the head with them . in the movie , the main character , cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to her . nasty ! she is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship should be jerry springer . she 's supposed to be a posh valley girl but at the end , she 's like ella may clampet going after jethro when all her resources for finding a man runs out .
0	i think i just do n't like pilates because i really did n't care for this workout . plus , you are constantly roling up and down and from years as a ballet dancer we have always been taught that rolling your spine when working the stomach will not flatten the stomach it will cause the muscle to bulk up in your stomach and you 'll have a round hard belly . this is not my idea of an attractive waist line and this is true because it happened to a girl in one of my classes . so , that 's the main reason i just did n't like this video
0	after watching `` harsh times '' we wondered `` is this a comedy or are they just mocking inner city life ? '' we could n't believe what we were watching . it was meant to be the new 2006 version of `` training day '' -- they even got christian bale to play the lead role -- but only in the eyes of the people involved in it . it was a miscalculation and we 'll explain why . brief story : the movie takes place mostly in the dangerous inner city streets of l.a. jim davis ( christian bale ) is a mentally unstable young iraq war veteran . now in the states , he is looking for a job as a cop . jim 's best friend mike alonzo ( freddy rodrÃ­guez ) is also unemployed , but when his friend comes to visit , they prefer to hang out and commit all kinds of illegal activities -- selling drugs , guns , getting high just to name few . to spend time with his friend , mike has to lie to his girlfriend sylvia ( eva longoria ) making her believe that he is looking for a job . she does n't know the world of crime they are involved in and the terrible consequences they might face . review : `` harsh times '' has many problems , but the most notorious one is the crime `` video game '' feeling it has throughout the film . the characters and situations are so unbelievable that the whole thing feels like watching a `` grand theft auto '' or `` scarface : the world is yours '' video game adaptation with a little bit of `` cheech chong '' in the mix . there is no climax -- we just see them driving to different places , arguing among themselves and committing all kinds of crimes without anything conclusive until the very end . christian bale 's accent in this movie does n't help either , not only it changes through out the film , but we are not sure what kind of accent he is trying to emulate . the dialogue between the two friends feels forced and teenager-like -- also there is no chemistry between them . the acting in this movie is disappointing , especially from bale who we liked in movies like `` american psycho '' , `` batman returns '' and `` the prestige . '' it is clear that he was miscast this time . he just can not do what denzel washington did in `` training day . '' because of his accent and terrible acting in this film , we believe this is his worst performance to date . this is something he does n't want to add to his resume . the verdict : christian bale returns , but this new american psycho can not find his equilibrium . `` harsh times '' tries too hard to create the edgy , dramatic style of the dangerous inner city life that `` training day '' had , but it does n't even come close to achieve that goal . we laugh at the silliness of the story , overdramatic acting and christian bale whose fake accent in this film has to be the worst of the year . he probably thought he was going to get nominated for best actor . this is a miscalculation of great proportions by him and his agent .
0	p.s . has potential . both grace and linney are great in it , but midway through the movie loses its mystic and gets boring . it 's a shame because it could 've been a great movie . great acting with a bland plot
0	whoever made this film is obviously trying to impress upon the viewer the idea that artists are deep complex people . but all i see in the film are low life drug addict losers who sit around ( few of them seem to have jobs ) and party all day . the main character ( sid ) is a pseudointellectual who claims she majored in critical theory in college ( ultra liberal nonsense which has the goal of undermining western culture to pave the pathway for marxism ) . the film appeals to naive youth
1	its amazing how strongly images and music can impact the senses without any spoken word . this is a great film to throw on , relax , and absorb .
0	is a bad sequel and have a poor quality of special effects
0	i have now seen several gerry anderson projects , many hits and some misses , this one is close to dead last for me ( wait , it is dead last ) . a priest driving a model t is the hero in this one . he also has a shrinking ray ( shrinks to like 1/3 normal ) that he uses on his assistant who is a groundskeeper/secret agent . sound interesting ? well , i got the set cheap so why not buy it ? if your an anderson fan as i am , it was worth the price , just do n't expect to show it to your friends as it 's really tame and slow plodding with model t car chases and not a whole lot of action . here is my ranking of the shows i like from gerry anderson so take that into account of your own tastes . # 1 ufo ( a live adult sci-fi show with some great character development ) , # 2 joe 90 ( the concept is great and the non continuous storylines work good here ) , # 3 captain scarlet ( i love the concept and a lot of the shows fit in with the current war on terror to me ) , # 4 thunderbirds ( had a corgi toy as a kid , it was the best show for kids on tv at the time ) , # 5 stingray ( for the time , it was a great action kids show ) , # 6 fireball xl5 ( like a stingray except in space and black and white ) , # 7 the protectors ( eh , it 's ok ) , # 8 space 1999 ( this is where my recommended shows stop , this show was so highly anticipated and quickly got really stupid even i could n't stay with it in the 70 's ) , # 9 terrahawks ( just started watching it now it may move up above space 1999 and the protectors ) , # 10 secret service . i have n't watched his other stuff and i know there is stuff out there like supercar but that would probably rank above secret service for me .
1	this is definitely the best ab workout . working in a desk job , i kept gaining weight around the ab area . after just two days of this dvd , i had results . it was incredible . the fat around my abs just kept shrinking and shrinking . i would recomend this to anybody . no matter how fit you are , there are four levels of difficulty . practically anybody can do the first level . i do all four . already i am seeing results . i hope he puts out more videos for upper body strength as well . can not stress how fast the results are . you will probably see results within a week
1	it 's not a great movie , but it 's a lot of fun . this is one of those movies that just catches me . it 's quirky and has some decent ( for it 's day ) effects . there are a feww laugh out loud momments . truth be told they are few and far between . some great bit characters make up a fun ensemble . the cast is pretty damn cool , with urich being upstaged by ron pearlman , angellica houston , john mat.. mattus ... the big guy . anyway , it 's cornball comedy with a basic plot . hey what do you want ? it 's 80 's chessy goodness and more fun that it should have been . i still giggle at the time warp battle
0	i have probably never seen a movie with quality as bad as this . even my old tapes from tv were 500 % better . the picture was faded , the characters looked like they were 90 years old and the sound track was off so badly that it also garbled words , so looking away from the movie did not help . it is also one hour long -- but seemed like three-probably a copy of a tv movie as it also had cuts for commercials though i could not find any place that said this . it was advertised as a 2 hour dvd-and it is -- i guess , but i could not see any more of it . at the end of one hour , it just showed credits and it was over . i am returning it-and it is the first copy of a dvd that i have ever returned for picture and sound quality
0	this dvd was a total disappointment . first of all , this video was a rip off of baby genius series , but without the production value . second , this video promises to introduce your child to fruits and vegetables and healthy eating habits . to be fair , there are fruits and vegetables , but not so cleverly disguised in this video you will find dead and burned animals ( grilled turkeys etc . ) and rotten milk ( in other term cheese ) , chicken period ( eggs ) , ice cream ( i think it 's a child abuse to feed your 6 month old ice cream ! ) and other non-fruit and non-vegetable foods . this video shows a toddler chewing on a hunk of parmasan cheese that 's bigger than baby 's head ! i believe it is morally right to properly advertise your product and not misrepresent what your product has to offer , especially when it comes to offering children first look at health and nutrition . i would not recommend this video for vegetarians , vegans , or other parents looking to teach their children proper health and eating habits .
1	my 2 yr old son has watched this dvd again and again . he 's not into cartoons , so the real life airplanes , trains , and buses suit him perfectly .
0	jackie is only in a brief clip in the beginning , stolen from the real drunken master . this clip is entirely unrelated to the movie , and is very short . buy this if you want , but not because you think it has jackie in it
1	good subject , the workings of a devious female mind . a complicated love triangle . superb acting
0	i purchased this movie without reading the reviews , based only on my fondness for older movies and the other movies i 've seen the two main stars in . this movie was awful , and the sad part is , there were sooooo many opportunities to save the movie all throughout . the acting was obviously overdone on purpose , i just wish i knew why - it did n't come off as funny or as a satire if that was the intent . in the end - i threw out the dvd so as not to accidently subject someone else to it
1	this thoughtfully prepared collection of 3 buster keaton movies , 2 shorts from early and late in his pre-feature period , and the feature seven chances , show a wide range of comedy styles , from slapstick , to more refined visual humor , to what we would today call situation comedy , where laughs come from unusual or embarrassing encounters . the earliest in the collection , `` neighbors '' from 1920 is in some way the most satisfying of the set , although keaton had not yet here fully developed his mature style of humor . here there is still a stylistic resemblance to the earlier association with fatty arbuckle . the backyard love affair , for example , that opens the film resembles arbuckle 's 1915 classic `` fatty 's plucky pup '' . in neighbors there is more story , revolving around the standard theme of feuding parents , and the eventual need for the couple to elope . there is sweetness , youthful energy , and innocence in the entire movie , as well as great acrobatics , including the innovative climactic escape involving two levels of men being carried on the shoulders of other men . the balloonatic ( 1923 ) , near the end of the period in which buster was making short films , is less rich in comic ideas and lacks the energy and freshness of the earlier film . there is almost no slapstick but rather visual humor involving being trapped in a balloon and trying to survive in the wild and win an unwilling girl . keaton loves using bodies of water and other objects of nature for comedic props , and this film is full of them . still , for once keaton seems uninspired , perhaps making this film to fulfill a contract requirement rather than for love of the story . the feature in the set , seven chances , from 1925 , is based on a single theme : buster , the rich boy down on his luck , must get married by the end of the day in order to inherit 7 million dollars . this absurd premise induces , for much of the film , a hal roach-like situation comedy rather than the visual , acrobatic style that is more associated with keaton , as buster is cornered into continuously proposing marriage to strangers . the variety of embarrassing rejections that buster must endure has funny moments , but may not satisfy all of buster 's fans . the climax , however , returns us to tried and true keaton formula : the lone man being chased by a thundering herd , in this case , of angry women in full wedding apparel , fed up at being duped by a newspaper ad submitted by buster 's colleague unbeknownst to buster . the chase has satisfying moments , including buster dodging large bolders . although worth seeing , the reliance on the single absurd premise makes this film feel more like a dragged out short movie than a genuine feature . the result is a slightly less satisfying encounter with keaton 's genius .
1	i am saying this as an italian american myself.. quit bashing the show because it portrays are small portion of italian americans.. its a tv show and a darn good one..it does not portray us all like that ... just this mob family..so quit being so sensitive and lighten up frances ... and ps..i do not care if this was help or not either !
1	loved them all ... found victoria albert and lorna doone a bit lacking . wondered about having more of the scarlet pimpernel offered - he 's so smooth ! tom jones is very special - loved sophie 's father , he truly made the film . as much as i liked him - hated lizzie 's mother in p p - what a ninny ! this is a great collection , would have liked to see vanity fair and persuasion offered also
1	hey ... this is a great dvd with great packaging -- definitely one of the best that i 've seen , and there is a lot of extras . definitely a must-have for he-man and she-ra fans ! i just got an e-mail stating that the distributor of he-man will be releasing she-ra on dvd , starting july 11 . that release will be `` the secret of the sword '' and five other episodes deemed most popular by fans . after that , in the fall they will release the complete 93 episodes in three separate volumes within the next 12 months . for anyone who wants to see for themselves , go to tvshowsondvd.com and look at the news for she-ra . i hope you are as excited as i am
0	ehhhhh . what is this ? this is one very stupid movie . how do i get a refund
0	once again , the powers that be at amazon have chosen to refuse to tell us if ( in this case ) the darin/dee flicks if a man answers and that funny feeling are in widescreen or not . pan-and-scan is garbage , and we wo n't buy it ! ( that 's why i only gave 1 star for now . if they turn out to be widescreen , i 'll give them both 5 stars . ) `` format : color '' does n't cut it . color is n't a format , anyway - it 's a specification or type . widescreen is a format ( as is dvd and vhs , to begin with ) . so why the deep dark secret about certain movies , amazon ? you list many others as being widescreen , so why do you go on to neglect so many other hundreds , though ? if it 's a standard screen piece of junk , go ahead and say so , and be done with it , and we 'll boycott it . but right now all you 're doing by holding back this important information is slowing down sales
1	robert ryan made a number of westerns during the 1950s and '60s , but always he seemed to be overshadowed by other actors in the genre . nevertheless , who can forget the wild bunch or his magnificent portrayal of `` old man clanton '' in the seriously underrated hour of the gun ( with james garner ) . and his self-effacing determination is equally unforgettable in the day of the outlaw . now one of his best roles , as the straight-arrow sheriff in the proud ones is on dvd and available at a very reasonable price . finally . the proud ones is perhaps director robert webb 's finest picture , combining great action scenes and plot twists , taught dialogue , and a superior cast that includes not only ryan , but jeffrey hunter , walter brennan , virginia mayo , and robert middleton . minor roles are given attention as well , especially arthur o'connell ( as ryan 's deputy ) and , important thematically , the wonderful paul burns , who plays the town drunk and panhandler ... .hunter , when he finally assumes the mantle of sheriff , will give alms to burns at the finish of the movie , just as ryan did at the beginning , when he was sheriff . this touch dramatically completes the movie and has much to say about hunter 's increased maturity . the proud ones is a superb movie , with a great story ... it will repay re-viewing . unlike some westerns , i do n't tire of watching it periodically . it is that good ...
1	for those reviewers who have not seen the remakes , see dail m for murder by alfred hitchcock , perfect murder starring michael douglas and gyneth paltrow , not to mention countless tv movies of the week . this is the original and the best.barbara stanwyck is superb , as is burt lancaster . moody and dark and suspenseful .
1	i saw this thai horror film about 3 years ago . i have to say this is the best supernatural thriller made from thailand , and i have seen a fair share of them ( nang nak , the sisters , mae nak , art of the devil series ) . the film focuses on tun and his girlfriend jane . tun , a photographer reunites with his old friends . on the way home , they accidentally hit a girl with their car and from then on , tun sees ghostly apparitions whenever he takes pictures or whenever he tries to develop them . ok , i am not spoiling anything , the story is more complex than it sounds . tun and his friends have a past that catches up to them , with jane caught in the middle . as usual , there is a vengeful spirit going around killing people . `` shutter '' refers to his camera and what it represents . `` sometimes the dead can not let go of their loved ones.. '' i 'm stopping here , i do n't want to give out anymore . the plot is not that complex , but believe me when i say , the film is well-made . it does a great job of putting things together , each shocking scene is linked to the past and the present . i did n't see any scene wasted and it has that very atmospheric , creepy feel to it . also , there is a scene in the movie that tun and jane looked at actual photos of ghostly apparitions in a polaroid . honestly , this film has some great scenes that can make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end the very first time you watch it and the `` shock ending '' has the greatest twist of any horror flick i 've seen ! i 've seen a lot of horror films , only the exorcist and the omen ever scared/creeped me out , and shutter came very close . my female friends were scared out of their wits when they saw it at my place . since i have n't seen the tartan release and i only own the region-3 dts-es rlease from panmedia ( hong kong ) but tartan usually uses the same transfers from either the hong kong or korean versions . the video is sufficient , with some dark and bright contrast . it is not free of grain but it does add to the atmospheric feel . the dts soundtrack is great though , very crisp and loud . the english subtitles are excellent , the thai language track is the only way to watch as it was meant to be seen . a definite must-see if you are a fan of asian horror or horror films in general . it rivals ringu , one missed call and the original ju-on 1 and 2 . four and 1/2 stars !
1	this dvd showcases a somewhat new ( as of the 2001 recording ) sound for sade , with slightly poppier and quicker supporting music . however , sade 's voice adapts beautifully , and she is one of those singers who just does n't need the standard studio treatment to sound tremendous . her buttery , chocolate lyrics come through with mesmerizing clarity on this dvd . after a few years of owning this dvd , i still enjoy and am transfixed by the wonderful editing , sound , and lights on this dvd . i highly recommend it to add to your `` chill-out '' collection . no longer the jazzy sade of yesteryear , the versatility of songs on this long ( almost 2-hours ? ) dvd will keep you grooving for hours
0	the quality of the dvd 's was good . however i did not like the third season as well as the first two seasons . it seemed that the story was setting up for season 4 .
0	i would often rush to see all arnold schwarzenegger films , i adore his bad acting `` it must be the muscles '' i was 10 year old and he was the bomb now his movies now gives me a pain in my stomach and i start to twitch , i ca n't believe how terrible an actor this man was `` is '' and all the money he made doing these unrealistic bull crap , wow ! talk about the american dream , i admit there are some of his movies i would have to rate a classic but however this one really sucks maybe it was the time , trend , maybe the era , but i have come a long way and this guy is a difinite no ! no ! for me , this movie had it 's moments ! for a 8 year old maybe ! for an adult you have to have a strong stomach , you i would never say this about bruce willis mybe i am a hypocrite or maybe he just an good actor duh ! i could n't care less do with this what you will i wo n't recommend it later folks
0	this is a review of the dvd , not the world series . please save your comments re the series for the sports blogs . in this day and age , for major league baseball to produce a non-anamorphic dvd is absolutely pathetic . this dvd was made for a widescreen tv ( 16:9 ratio ) , but can not take advantage of it , because it is non-anamorphic , meaning it will not take up the full widescreen . it has black bars on all four sides . they may as well have made it full screen instead , with a 4:3 ratio . also , in its rush to make a lot of money by getting the dvd out quickly , they decided not to include footage from the season , to show nothing of the tigers ' play-off run , and to provide mostly filler with worthless interviews from players . ( `` gee , was it exciting to be out on the mound ! '' ) i am an avid cardinals fan , but this dvd was not worth the $ 14.99 i paid for it . major league baseball , as usual , cheats its fans . another lesson they fail to learn from pro football
0	what an incredible waste of acting talent `` there was a crooked man '' turned out to be . director joseph mankiewicz celebrated for classics such as `` all about eve '' and `` the barefoot contessa '' should be embarrassed by this bomb . kirk douglas plays paris pittman jr. a charming , persuasive prisoner incarcerated in territorial prison for ten years for an armed robbery that netted him $ 500,000 . he hid the loot prior to his capture . it 's presence is common knowledge among the inmates giving him celebrity status . newly appointed warden woodrow lopeman played by henry fonda is trying to use douglas ' influence to coax the inmates help him initiate prison reform . under the guise of playing along with fonda , douglas secretly plots his escape to be reunited with his ill gotten cash . with an excellent cast including hume cronyn , burgess meredith and lee grant , i expected a whole lot more than this disappointing flick delivered
0	it 's good to see that in his twilight years , old squinty eyes , clint eastwood is growing comfortable playing grouchy old dudes , because , well , he is a grouchy old dude . this movie is anemic from the beginning . taken from a wonderful novel by michael connelly , clint plays an old grouchy dude who 's just gotten a new ticker because his last one gave out while chasing a serial killer . run , run , run , thud . next , new ticker intact , clint is hired to find the murderer of a cute black woman by her sister , another cute black woman . oh , and cbw # 2 plays the guilt card on clint , because he 's got his new ticker courtesy of cbw # 1 . so there 's a little bit of investigative work , a little but of huffin ' and a puffin ' , and finally clint discovers who the serial killer is who was responsible for his first ticker giving out and the murder of the donor of his second ticker . jeff daniels plays a doofus that lives next door to clint . what a stretch . special warning : clint takes off his shirt yet again in this film as he smooches on cbw # 2 . it must be in his contract or something . no one , and i mean , no one wants to see saggy clint with his shirt off . for a much , much better clint movie , go rent `` unforgiven ''
0	this movie is a rehash of the first , but it is a crappy , unconvincing , emotionally uninspiring movie . let me guess what part 3 will be about : a guy who looks at video or pictures goes back in time , does not alter that timeline the way he wants ( i.e . always worst case scenario ) and ends up killing himself in the end for the sake of everyone else
0	despite the talented cast this is perhaps the most ridiculous film ever.a goofy hippy copy laughs along the way trying to catch an eleven murder serial killer.this writer did moonstruck , but this is moonstink.seeing rod steiger with this material is a tragedy.the case is a joke , the characters are impossibly lame , and the dialogue would gag a collie.this film is worth seeing only to gain appreciatiation for the value of screenwriters.no amount of acting talent can lift this turkey out of the bankok privey.i just watched this film and at the conclusion i just sat there with my mouth open not believeing how bad the film was.saradon , keitel , kline , steiger , and rickman ... .will try and forget this dog their entire lives . i can not imagaine how any studio or distributing company let this turkey reach the public.have i gotten the point accross that the film is weak ... .i hope so.if i could give it zero stars or even better , minus eleven stars , i would
0	incredible does describe this movie- incredibly bad ! this movie does n't know what it wants to be . at times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of `` mississippi burning '' or the anger and impunity of `` ghosts of mississippi '' , or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre . at other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors , matthew mcconaughey and sandra bullock . as a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre 's list of movies for lack of originality , and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make . some of my favorite actors are wasted , either by being given cliched dialogue , over acting , or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence . if this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book , then i have no interest in reading the book . i 'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper . but the direction does n't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own . bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role , proving she 's only worthy of b-grade `` miss congeniality '' type crud . mcconaughey over acts so much ( as can be said for keifer sutherland and others ) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of patrick mcgoohan , kevin spacey and donald sutherland . samuel l. jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever , but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in . even the extras in this movie are horrible . enough ca n't be said about the terrible direction in this movie , equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault , making sergio leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison . this is not `` a powerful film . '' it 's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast , a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience , and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions , culminating in an over the top , pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by mcconaughey that would n't hold water in any real court of justice . maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt , or because they have n't seen quality comparisons and classics like `` mississippis burning , '' that has both a great script and fabulous acting . i do n't know . all i know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started . among the top of my most over rated movies
1	this film released in late 1984 , is about a married man named rob salinger ( the late dudley moore ) who secretly marries another woman during his current marriage . rob is a newspaper editor married to micheline `` micki '' salinger ( ann reinking ) , a judge . while secretly romancing maude ( amy irving ) , he proposes to her ( maude ) . rob has babies by both women and in one of the last scenes , they ( the women ) both meet and converse about their respective simultaneous marriages . but rob keeps both wives . in the real world , bigamy is undoubtedly illegal . director blake edwards ' previous film credits include breakfast at tiffany 's and the pink panther . subsequently , he directed the late john ritter in 1989 's skin deep
1	i think pauly shore is much more talented then people give him credit for . it is not as easy at it seems to play the character he played in every single one of his films . but the problem is that he has played the same character in all the movies he made . frankly i dont think he made this movie or started his new reality show to restart his career , i think he probably knows that he is a living joke , i feel he is just trying to give people a laugh and i 'd say hes done that
1	swiss-austrian actor von sydow very good and look for john wayne as ro- man soldier who uses title line
0	they spend the first half of this movie saying how great the ultimate warrior was . the journey is awesome ! then all of the sudden , the paid wwe guys just began to bad-mouth the warrior . maybe he did have questionable judgment - but why are they trying to make us feel bad about someone we loved ? they take some very low blows . they say that the warrior was a bad wrestler . actually he seemed just fine to me when i was young , and i really ca n't distinguish one 's ability from the other . they just all gang up on him and make outragious allegations . vince says quickly that the reason why the ultimate disappeared for 3 years was because he failed a drug test . as soon as he says this , they fade to black then come back with a new issue . what drug use ? which drugs ? presumably they 're talking about steroids . but what about that high and mighty hulk hogan with his admitted drug use . let 's not talk about that - let 's just keep ganging up on the warrior . they completely ridicule him changing his name to the warrior . and they also just try to badmouth him so much . who cares that none of the wrestlers liked him ? i do n't ! he excited the heck out of me way more than any of the dorks who say bad things about him -including hulk . and oh yeah - they do n't even let the warrior defend himself . why did i have to find out from imdb.com that he was asked to appear but declined ? why do n't they address this ? this `` docu '' is more slanted than `` fahrenheitt 911 '' every wrestling and ultimate warrior fan will start out loving this docu then hating it . it just leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth , tired of all of the whining and bitter trash talking .
0	there are no words to describe how awful ( ! ! ! ) this `` movie '' was from beginning to end , but let me try anyway so as to give people a fair chance to avoid it and thus try and prevent their day/evening from being ruined : the film supposedly deals with a woman who has an accident and is `` touched '' by a sex angel only to discover she is a sex addict and the twelfth sex apostle ... need i say more ? the plot , the `` humor , '' the dialogues , and the music are way beyond `` below average . '' there is next to no nudity and there are no , i mean 0 as in zero beautiful girls , in this film ! as for the acting-oh my- the acting is beyond words ... school plays ( and pre-school for that matter ) have better actors ! it is truly sad ... rent or buy ( ha ha ha ) at your own risk . you have been warned !
1	i am a faithful csi watcher , and have been since the shows inception . i buy the dvd sets and enjoy them tremendously . however , there are two trends i see developing that i do n't care for -- -one , there is too much catherine . we know everything about her kid , her dead husband , her crook father , etc. , and she 's really an annoying character . she makes nasty comments about everyone ; she 's always being insubordinate ; she goes out with men half her age ( let 's quit trying to make her seem like a young chick when she is n't , especially wearing those skin tight jeans ) , she is very arrogant , and even though she continually screws up ( loses her camera ; blows up the lab in a previous season , accuses people before she has all the evidence ) , they made her a supervisor . also , the plot line with grissom and sara , while predictable , is not the greatest . i think grissom would be better off paired with lady heather . there 's an idea ! let 's see more of lady heather . still , even with the annoying overabundance of the least likable character ( catherine ) , the show is one of the best , if not the best , on tv ( up there with without a trace , ncis and numbers ) . keep 'em coming
0	love the movie , but the quality of the dvd put out by alpha video was so bad it was very difficult to watch . the sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up . if you do n't want to be disappointed and feel like you 've been ripped off , wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one
0	anything having to do with paris hilton is doomed to be garbage . the premise of the story is trite and in the end leaves the audience wondering `` whaaaaa '' . the only person not to die is scottish and that 's the only reason why he didnt ; because he 's scottish . what ? ? ? ? ? sick plot , dumb characters overall dulllll . how many movies will they make with `` a group of friends in a secluded castle '' yes i borrowed the movie which is great compared to paying $ 20.00 for the dvd and wasting my money and time watching it . yawwwwwwwwwwn ! !
0	if you love well written stories , great plots and captivating acting then this movie is not for you . i do n't know how the producer managed to swindle precious investor dollars to get this tripe made into a movie , however there it is ! it was so boring and so badly done that after the first 1 hour and 45 minutes i had to turn it off . i do n't even want to know how it ended . the cast line up was great ! that 's the only 'positive ' comment i can make with regards to this movie . do not watch it . do not hire it . do not believe anybody who thinks it is good . the two lesbians who made love even did that scene poorly ; get this , it was done in the missionary position ! avoid this movie
1	ray sawyer ( rick cramer ) , agnes bruckner ( eden ) , laura ramsey ( rachel ) , jonathan jackson ( eric ) , and d.j . cotrana ( sean ) star in this scary and bloody slasher movie . eric and eden are going through any typical teen romance ; going steady one minute , broken up the next . eden works at a local truck stop as a waitress . one evening , ray pulls into the truck stop to get some food . known as the local nut case , ray has few friends and owns a filling station on the edge of town . later that same evening , ray comes upon eric and eden on a lonely bridge . swerving to miss eric 's jeep , ray instead crashes into an on-coming car . the impact of the crash sends the car slamming through the guardrail of the bridge . the car is now teetering precariously on the side of the bridge . ray jumps from his truck and goes to the aid of the woman inside the car . after pulling her to safety , ray goes back inside to retrieve a suitcase that the woman told him about . however , both ray and the car tumble over the side of the bridge and into the water below . to make matters worse , the suitcase is full of poisonous snakes , who immediately begin striking at ray . all that can be heard are ray 's screams as the car sinks . ray 's body is pulled from the water and taken to the local morgue . but it does n't remain there for long . it seems that the woman in the car was a voodoo priestess , and the snakes were used to `` cleanse '' people by drawing the evil out of them . now , the evil venom is flowing through ray . now begins a bloodbath of carnage as ray , possessed by the power of the evil venom flowing through him , begins to stalk unsuspecting victims . one by one , he exacts his revenge on eden 's friends until only eden remains . who will win this final showdown ; ray or eden ? i 've always been a big fan of slasher-type films , and characters like freddy from the `` nightmare on elm street '' series , as well as jason from `` friday the 13th '' . ray sawyer fits the mold of the typical slasher perfectly . the motives are the same ; kill as many teenagers as possible , and ray succeeds in this very well . i thought the story involving voodoo was well-conceived . the special effects were good , too . i recommend this movie to horror and slasher fans . although the movie is short ( only about 80 minutes ) , there 's lots of slashing in a short amount of time . if you enjoy a good slasher flick , then do n't miss `` venom '' .
0	we have a lawman who for no explained reason starts to investigate the cause of death of a man with 500,000 on him and it all goes down hill from there . there is no rhyme or reason to the story . i gave it two stars because the landscape is great
0	i remember going to great lengths to fit a matine showing of heaven 's prisoners into a busy saturday afternoon during its 1996 theatrical release . considering the source material and the talent behind and in front of the camera , our little filmgoing party of detective-film fans and alec baldwin groupies ( a.k.a . my mom , my stepfather , and me ) found this contemporary film noir to be a big disappointment . baldwin , who also served as co-producer , brought james lee burke 's new orleans ex-cop/recovering alcoholic hero dave robichoux from the printed page to the big screen . while baldwin and the rest of the cast did well in fleshing out burke 's characters and have some tangy tough-guy/gal dialogue , they 're hampered by two things : 1 . ) the film 's slo-o-o-ow pacing . maybe the louisiana heat got to everyone , not just baldwin . of all the actors , long island native baldwin sweats the most , so much that it began to remind me of the sweating-bullets gags with albert brooks in broadcast news and robert hays in airplane ! 2 . ) a plot that , as rendered in the film ( whether it 's the fault of the screenwriter or the editor , i ca n't be sure ) , never quite follows through on any of its elements . it 's too bad , because these elements could 've made for an exciting movie : drug dealing , illegal alien smuggling , rival crime bosses ( one is played colorfully by eric roberts before he became a parody of himself , essentially playing a southern-fried version of his character from director phil joanou 's 1992 thriller final analysis ) , an adorable little salvadoran orphan girl ( named `` alafair '' by the robichouxs , after dave 's mom . late in my pregnancy at the time , i liked the name alafair so much , i nearly changed my mind about naming my then-unborn daughter siobhan ! ) , and a bevy of beautiful , beguiling women , including earth mother kelly lynch , vampy teri hatcher in a full-frontal nude scene that was much ballyhooed at the time , and mary stuart masterson , looking like a young jessica lange in what was then a change-of-pace role for her : a troubled stripper who loves robichoux . despite the sexy promises in the movie 's ads , none of the ladies share anything with baldwin but dialogue and some kisses and/or embraces . maybe the climate was already so hot , the filmmakers did n't want to add any further steaminess for fear of poor baldwin collapsing from heat prostration ! as my mom put it at the time : `` i thought the height of my day would be seeing sexy , dashing alec baldwin , but he came up sweaty , rumpled , tired , depressed , and moving as if he was in slow motion . if he 'd made love as many times as he got beaten up , it would 've been the sexiest picture of '96 ! '' to be fair , there *are* a number of strong characterization and action scenes , but there 's just too darn much talky , molasses-paced lag time between them -- and yet , oddly , some of the scenes end abruptly just as they 're about to become intriguing ! perhaps joanou , baldwin co. could 've dredged a tighter , more involving thriller out of this if they 'd whittled the 140-minute running time down to 105 minutes or so . as heaven 's prisoners is now ... well , read james lee burke 's books instead .
1	after starting my 9/11 odyssey from ignorance to full blown `` what ! '' after `` loose change - 2nd ed '' last year , i 've watched and or read just about them all . 9/11 : press for truth comes out on top , in my humble opinion , as the best 9/11 timeline presentation out there . nothing included that is n't in the mainstream press - just on the back page , and spread out over five years . the film makes few of the outright accusations that `` loose change 2nd - ed '' does towards any of the events or people involved in 9/11 , but delivers more of damning argument that we 've been lied to - there were n't just mistakes made , but distortions and deceit at the highest levels of our government . i hope that we , the people , finally demand a real investigation and the truth comes out . and the bad guys pay . good movie
0	well not to bad a deal.most of the movies here are n't too bad ( the inspector general , a farewell to arms , a star is born etc ; ) and have basically clear picture and sound quality.it 's true several of these are silent but even a few of those are good.there is a problem with this set however , after you 've watched these movies once they will begin to wear out my mother and i discovered this when we wanted to watch `` the flying deuces '' for the second time the film was a lot more blurry and it was difficut to hear some of the dialogue.my advice is not buy this collection unless you find it for sale very cheap , and to just rent some of the better ones.we did get a few things out of this my mother said that she discovered buster keaton , w.c.fields and charlie chaplin because of this for instance , ( and after we liked father 's litle dividend we decided to watch father of the bride which was even better ) so i have decided to give it an extra star just for that
1	i have not gotten into watching the dvd as of yet because i am still watching the reruns on tv , but i know i have no qualms with the dvd . i have bought all the series thus far . it is a collection to have in your library if you are indeed a fan
0	this is a surprisingly poor movie . although it has some well-known actors , and a notable director , the material was just presented badly and predictably - like a lousy late night tv-movie with profanity inserted to liven it up . the movie makes a simplified joke of the legal system and its sterotypical failings ( though legitimate in many cases ) . it also glosses over the grieving process of the family , ignores the normal safety warnings to the remaining child , overdoes kiefer sutherland 's character flaws ( which are considerable nevertheless ) , and generally oversimplifies everything into a neat package to which you already know the ending because of the spoiler title . in one particularly-bad scene , after taking martial arts classes and other measures to prepare herself mentally and physically , sally 's character simply stares open-mouthed and dumbfounded at keifer 's character when they meet on the street and he talks to her . i do n't know what i missed that the 4- and 5-star reviewers like so much . i only see wide-spread mediocrity . i would only recommend this for fans of keifer . `` ssssssorry '' , sally , not your best role or movie . ditto ed harris , whose other movies i generally like .
1	we enjoyed this video . the rugby athletes are fun to watch in such a surreal setting . somehow , these tough , big athletes being posed and shot in various homoerotic poses gives new meaning to `` sporn '' .
1	this movie is my all time favorite . my friends and my sister enjoyed watching this movie and we watched it over and over .
1	based on bizet 's tragic spanish opera , this was rita hayworth 's first film made by her production company , beckworth ( derived from her screen surname and from the name of her daughter , rebecca ) . she decided on her close friend and favorite leading man , glenn ford , as don jose to her carmen . the results are far better than some reviews would have you believe . the glorious , lush techincolor is fabulous ( studio-bound as most of the sets may be ) , while hayworth 's unforgettable screen presence , dancing and bewitching beauty , and the heat generated between her and ford makes this movie memorable . the sequence in which she describes what virtues a lover should have ( complete with putting her finger to his lips ) sparkles with sensual static . granted , ford looks stiff and ill at ease in his uniform ( after he sheds his soldier garb and dons his `` bandit clothing '' , he appears much more relaxed ) . if it is deemed worthy enough to be released as part of the columbia classics collection , so should `` affair in trinidad '' , another hayworth/ford collaboration . it 's just great to look at , flaws aside . if you adore rita and glenn , even in a tempestuous , volatile romance , this movie will provide that for you . was there ever a more enticing , tempestous gypsy with so many men in her life but only one true and ultimately tragic love ?
0	i would have liked a more real story in this dvd
1	great movie with great sound and visuals . what it on a hd tv and get blown awa
1	i really enjoyed this dvd-and all of the combos were doable with great breakdowns . the instructor actually starts with the left foot , so you can follow her mirror image . i teach dance and will definately use a lot of these moves . and , you will work up a sweat , if you want more just do jumping jacks or run when they march . enjoy
0	i had several friends insist that i rent this film . i 'm glad i did instead of buying it . i was not bowled over as they obviously were - quoting lines from it and all but wetting themselves remembering scenes from the film . now , i 'm not a hard guy to make laugh , but there was only one point in this film where i actually laughed out loud . other than that , i found sordid lives to be just tediously amateurish and more than a bit forced . i love southern humor and even poking fun at southerners : i ca n't tell you how much i love greater tuna , fried green tomatos , steel magnolias , etc . but this just did n't cut it for me . the cast is a who 's who of excellent character actors : beau bridges , bonnie bedelia , leslie jordan , olivia newton-john ( for pete 's sake ! ) , erik krieger , delta burke and gobs of others . no , it 's not a shortage of talent that this film lacks . i found that it was a lack of a cohesive direction that made me wince more than once . there 's a scene with ty ( an out of the closet to everyone but his parents young man who lives in west hollywood ) talking to his ex-girlfriend in the reception area of their therapist ... well , as a theatre director , i can only tell you that the performances during this one scene are so painfully badly acted and the pregnant pauses between the lines are so large you could drive fleets of trucks through them . there are various filming techniques that del shores ( the director ) uses that are just hackneyed : filming from behind a person 's back so that only the back of one person 's head and the facing person are seen . why ? it feels like a testimonial `` video '' from mtv 's real world rather than an actual film . frankly - and this is not always a bad thing - the whole film felt like it was a play converted to film . it can be a great thing ! look at altmans ' come back to the five and dime jimmy dean and you 'll see how a good stage to film movie is done . but this ... well , it 's just amateur hour from my perspective . in all , the film felt like a poor man 's greater tuna ( two quick change artists playing 16 characters living in texas ' 3rd smallest town ) , which was a stage play and was filmed for hbo as a stage play rather than attempting to make it feel like a film . i wanted to like this film , but i just did n't
1	this video is awsome if you dont like this video then you ca n't be t true pantera fan . it doesnt get any better than this except for live . watch it go ! ! !
0	this film offers none of the cheap thrills of a horror film , and has many flaws : a silly plot , cheap religious imagery ( dracula is judas , jeez louise ) , and not one truly sexy or scary moment . and it wastes three gorgeous gals as dracula 's brides , including jennifer esposito jeri ryan . if you ca n't make a film sexy with these two , you 're in the wrong business . craven has an over inflated rep as a director , he does n't deserve any rep as a producer , if this leaden film is a sample . it makes the worse universal horror film look like citizen kane in comparison . save your money and pick up something scary instead , like bava 's black sunday or any hammer horror
1	do n't listen to anyone when they say this movie is bad , it 's good . elektra is filled with aciton , and fx and supervillians ! elektra is one of the best marvel movies ! go see it now
1	this movie was the first dvd i ever bought ! it is truly a gem . i like the infinifilm bonus features . ( it may not have been called infinifilm at this time . ) brett ratner is truly a comedic genius , and really gives the customer great quality dvd 's . the movie is funny and interesting enough . i enjoyed the scenes in several different locales . i enjoyed the physical interactions between jackie and chris tucker . i think the stunts were wonderfully orchestrated . jackie chan is a genius at physical comedy . i highly recommend this dvd . two thumbs up ! ! ! mc white said : check it out ! ! !
1	screenwriter charlie kaufman 's reality-bending work has become such a hollywood staple that he is becoming more distinctive than the directors who give life to his wildly imaginative and solipsistic scripts . he dares to give dramatic form to nebulous psychological states that border on horror stories . directed by michel gondry , this 2004 study in love and loss is no exception , as kaufman takes the notion of a struggling relationship and inverts it into a manic piece of science fiction involving a medical procedure to scrub one 's memory . at the same time , gondry and kaufman have injected a strong dose of humanism into this film by grounding it with characters that are relatable as much as they are quirky . the labyrinth plot focuses on shy , taciturn joel barish , who is swept off his feet by the raucous , unstable clementine . much to his dismay after a particularly ugly fight , he discovers that clementine has impulsively decided to erase all memory of her relationship with him through a medical company called lacuna headed by the benevolent dr. mierzwiak . a renowned leader in his field of memory erasure , mierzwiak treats the heartbroken joel to the same procedure as clementine 's . however , joel is overcome by the intensity of emotion from this act of reciprocation and starts rebelling against the deep consciousness treatment to regain his memories of clementine . the surreal twists and turns that occur boggle the mind of the viewer but not in a way that alienates us from joel 's plight . it helps that a sturdy cast has been recruited starting with a surprisingly subdued jim carrey as the depressed joel . this is easily his most effective attempt at a straight dramatic role even though gondry allows him to provide flashes of his manic personality when appropriate . displaying no trace of her corseted britishness as the bedraggled free spirit clementine , kate winslet shows the right level of abandon and leavens it with her natural earthiness . tom wilkinson is his usual steady self as the somewhat remorseful mierzwiak , while his spirited trio of assistants is played with relish by kirsten dunst , mark ruffalo and elijah wood . all three are fine with dunst particularly affecting toward the end . the looping narrative could have spiraled out of control had it not been for the stellar work by cinematographer ellen kuras , production designer dan leigh and editor valdis oskarsdottir , all combining to bring much-needed fluidity to initially incoherent scenes . the only fly in the ointment is jon brion 's overly intrusive music . the 2004 dvd has several extras , the best of which is the consistently informative commentary track by gondry and kaufman , which helps explain some of the more bizarre plot turns . there are two featurettes - a standard ten-minute making-of short and a fifteen-minute conversation with gondry and carrey that borders on banal . seven minutes of understandably excised scenes are included , as well as a creative music video of the polyphonic spree 's `` night and day '' and a faux-commercial for lacuna
0	this production is misleadingly named . far from being a biography of grand duchess anastasia , it is really the story of how the deaths of her family at the hands of russian revolutionaries in 1918 spawned one of the 20th century 's enduring mysteries -- a mystery which was given a unique lease on life when , among the myriad male and female claimants to be survivors of the imperial family , one woman began to pick up supporters in the 1920 's among at least some people who had had contact with the original family . i do not fault this production for failing to be a real biography . after all , how much of a biography can one write on a 17-year-old girl whose life was largely one of sheltered privilege ? however , i do fault this production for being a badly-flawed recounting of history . and i am not talking about the interminable debate that still rages in the arcane world of romanov history buffs about whether anna anderson was really anastasia . this work 's take on the life of anastasia paints a very tilted picture both of the world of the romanovs , their support among their subjects , and their reputation among today 's russians . first , life in the inner sanctum of nicholas 's family was not the halcyon existence this production claims . certainly the family had great wealth and huge staff at its disposal . but neither nicholas nor alexandra were well-suited to their roles , and they lived under the strain of it . they were increasingly isolated from the extended romanov clan , who shared the dawning awareness of the russian people that the monarchy was in serious trouble . while these forces might not have touched anastasia directly , she was certainly touched by her brother 's hemophilia and her mother 's response of sinking into frail health , chronic emotional distress , and a religious mysticism that almost bordered on hysteria at times . secondly , this film 's portrayal of the counter-revolutionary white army as determined to save their beloved tsar from captivity is just plain wrong . while the whites wanted to unseat the bolshevik revolution , there was virtually no support for a romanov restoration among the leadership of the white army . nor are there any known attempts by the counter-revolutionary forces to rescue their former imperial family . in fact , one senior white military leader once remarked , `` having seen the monarchy at close quarters , i have no desire to see its return . '' and thirdly , while there is a gradual rehabilitation of the last romanov 's reputation underway in russia today , the notion that the murdered romanovs are saints is not nearly the widespread sentiment that this production claims . in fact , the great masses of modern russians are far more interested in making their new democracy work than in figuring out how to get the sainted romanovs back on a throne . i do not know whether these flaws arise from some agenda to rehabilitate the romanovs , whether they arise from sloppy research that relied too much on the fawning pseudo-history that plagues serious study of the russian monarchy 's fading years , or whether this production did not have access to newly-opened archives . but -- whatever the reason ( s ) -- it does a disservice to the study of history by claiming to be history when it is , in fact , closer to a grocery-store romance novel
0	'clownhouse ' is mainly associated with a sex scandal involving the director and the youngest boy actor . while hearing of salva 's conviction when 'jeepers creepers ' came out , i never knew it had anything to do with this movie , nor had i ever heard of this in the first place . i actually stumbled upon this looking to see if there was a horror movie involving clowns besides 'it ' , and came across this weird little 'halloween'-like suspense tale . while the sex scandal never once popped into my head ( except when there was a pointless and gratuitous butt shot of the kid ) , i still did n't care for this too much , despite its pluses . like 'halloween ' , this film relies on suspense rather than gore to creep people out , but sadly , it did n't really get to me . if i was about 9 or so , this would 've scared the hell out of me . i 'm not saying i hated this ; it was all right and had some geniune chills and some fantastic images , but because you see who the clowns are before they find the house and start terrorizing the children , it lost some effect for me . i would have liked it better if i had no idea what was going on , and it would 've been a creepier experience . horror movie fans should like this , even though i personally thought it would be better . the atmosphere is very , very creepy , and the clowns are actually pretty terrifying in their own way , but it just did n't do it for me . rent it first
0	i 'm a huge don cheadle fan , but this film is unworthy of him . [ people ] who claim that it 's a story about racism either do n't understand the film or do n't understand racism . basically , here 's the plot : the character played by mekhi pfeiffer is an unwitting accomplice in a botched armed robbery that leaves three people dying on the floor of a grocery store . rather than summon help for the others , all pfeiffer can think to do is help himself to the money in the cash register . he is caught , and in the ensuing trial the prosecutor calls him an animal because of his depraved indifference to human life . that is supposed to be the psychological turning point in the film , because pfeiffer 's family insists on proving that he 's no animal and can take his punishment -- in this case , death -- with his head held high . yeah , right . guess what ? he is an animal , and if the story had involved all-black or all-white characters , racism would n't be an issue . a more compelling question : if pfeiffer 's family was so concerned with his `` dignity , '' why did n't they teach him moral values in the first place
1	i loved this film . the writting , story , special effects , acting , and directing exceed the original . i recomend this film to any fan of the genre
0	i just watched this movie version of the classic childrens ' book with my wife . here are my gut impressions : first , very little is true to the book . that 's not really a gut impression . that 's the impression i got hearing my wife say `` that 's not in the book ... that 's not in the book ... '' actually this movie is more like a computer animation demo than a vehicle for story telling . it makes for beautiful stills and pictures , and those made me want to see the movie . i expected a heart warming christmas story , and what i got was about an hour of frantic scenes of out-of-control railroad and other technology animated like never before with just enough pauses betwen them to remind me why i 'm watching . you get to see ... a kid chasing a ticket through a train , a kid chasing a ticket over the roof of a train , a ticket making its way through the forest -- rube goldberg style -- back to the train , ( forty minutes into this movie and one girl 's train ticket is the star of the show ! ) ok , the ticket sub plot is resolved and we have ... a train sliding out of control on the ice , a train trying to outrun cracks on the ice , a train going full throttle out of control and racing up and down mountain valleys like a roller coaster ( fans of the `` coaster tycoon '' series of computer games will feel right at home ) until finally it arrives at the north pole . then , the train car with the central character kids gets detached so we have ... a train car running out of control through santa 's village , kids getting lost in the christmas present manufacturing plant and falling through the chutes and machinery of the factory , and then ... kids getting lost in a bag of presents that is taken by a flying machine to santa 's sled launching pad where the star at the top of the tree is dislodged and nearly impales an innocent elf . ho ho ho . at least let me have a joystick and a couple of buttons so i can help these kids out ! it 's like a computer animated train wreck in fast motion . you know it 's awful but you ca n't look away ! and , you 'd better think twice before letting any very young children see this . it could be very frightening on a big screen with the volume turned up . my wife and i were going to watch it with our three and six year old sons , and we were very glad that we did n't . so , what could have been a classic , enduring , and endearing compliment to a classic childrens ' christmas story is little more than a great line for some computer animator to have on his or her resume . two thirds of this movie is devoted to stuff that does n't advance the story or develop the characters one bit . whatever a `` character driven '' story is , this is the opposite . never have i seen so many rendered pixels doing so much and accomplishing so little . i 'd rather set up my old american flyer electric trains and let them run around the tree while i read the book to my kids .
1	i have owned a copy of this film for a long time . i have probably watched it ten times , and i always tear up a little at each viewing . from the beginning newsreel , of a shell-shocked diane feinstein announcing the less than hour old murders of harvey milk and mayor george moscone , to the final reel of harvey milk 's prophetic and haunting statements , the viewer is mesmerized . though harvey milk was a san francisco city supervisor , his election in the 1970 's , that of an open and unrepentant gay man , made national headlines . he was a ray of hope to gay people everywhere , who at that time were unrepresented and , for the most part , still forced into the closet . this film not only gives insight into the philosiphy of harvey milk , but is a rare document into that not so long ago but seemingly ancient time . milk was a very eloquent speaker , and his sensibility , logic , and unapologetic viewpoint more often than not made mincemeat of any verbal opponent . this is best displayed in the footage of his debate with then california senator briggs , a buffoon like character , who not only was a terrible speaker , who could n't even clearly express his arguably irrational fears , but who in fact seemed much prissier than his nemesis milk . the public view at that time was about family values , with the anita bryants condeming homosexuals to hell for their decadent ways ( old times come round again ... . ) . milk 's voice opposed this view openly , and he seemed to predict his early demise at the hands of an assassin who was against what he represented . the notion of this martyrdom , and its romantic though fateful attraction to milk , has been argued . nevertheless , his bravery in representing the unrepresented can not be argued , and the sordid details of his love affairs and personal life should not diminish his message , nor the admiration he deserves . this film unfolds as it happened , seeming like fiction , but all too real . as milk is assassinated , along with the mayor , by the homophobic and disgruntled resigned supervisor dan white , whose subsequent trial , with the famous `` twinkie defense '' , and his being sentenced to an appalling five years for the murders , resulted in riots the likes of which the city had never seen . as one of those interviewed here expresses with sad resignation , ... if only the mayor had been killed , white would have gotten life , but the fact that milk , a gay man , had also been killed , leaned public sympathy towards white , an absurd but all too realistic conclusion.there are many moving , telling , historically signifigant moments in this film , but none so clearly represents those times , and milk 's loss and legacy , as the film of the nighttime march in san francisco right after the murders . seas of people , holding candles and standing silently , came together in a very moving moment in time . this film , which won best documentary at that years oscars , transcends its subject matter , and is simply a great documentary . gay rights have made much progress . and perhaps time has diminished their names and these memories to most all , excluding those who were there , are old enough to remember , or are gay . nonetheless , harvey milk is a representive and icon of the early gay rights movement , and his legacy , through schools named after him , organizations , and his place in history as a voice for the all too often voiceless , lives on .
1	i grew up with the original ds . i also saw the two `` spin off '' movies : `` house of dark shadows '' and `` night of dark shadows . '' needless to say i was extremely excited about the `` revival , '' and i was n't disappointed . i felt that dan curtis was actually able to improve upon the original , by tightening up the script and employing wonderful actors who fit like the proverbial glove . the original barnabus was played by jonathan frid who was a shakespearian trained actor and , ben cross is a member of the royal shakespearian theatre in london . i loved that the revival was able to be more overtly sexual , which as any fan of vampires must know is an essential element of the myth . and i must say this series lived up to my every expectation . dan curtis took the original and made it completely accessible to older viewers who have such fond memories of the 1963 soap opera . i looked forward to 3:30 every day after school . it 's too bad that the gulf war killed it . yes it did ! i was there . after the sunday , monday miniseries , that friday was to air the first `` episode . '' however it was pre-empted by coverage of the war . too , too bad . i taped it , but unfortunately the last few episodes were accidentally taped over . i am so glad to know that i can order it now in it 's magical entirety . i 'm ordering it right now ! thank you amazon ! ! ! ! ! ! ! if you are a fan of things that go bump in the night , you will love this series ! ! ! !
0	this is the french x-rated version of 99 women , directed by jess franco . the running time of this feature is 98 minutes , which means that this is probably the longest , least censored version of the film that is available . the story involves a women`s island prison , a sadistic female warden , a lustful male governor , and the young , lovely female inmates . can you see where this is heading ? there are scenes of extreme sexuality ( especially when you consider the film was released in 1969 ) which include ( ... ) . my big problem with this movie is that the hardcore scenes are haphazardly edited into the film . in a few cases , they don`t even seem to be part of the scenes that you have been watching . also frustrating is the fact that some of the actors taking part in the sex scenes look nothing like the actors that they are doubling ( standing-in ) for . just because a woman is wearing a blonde wig does not mean she is going to look like the lead actress that she is portraying . i guess that this movie was pushing the boundaries in 1969 , but looking at the dumb story , lousy editing , and sex scenes from a 2005 perspective ... ..this is just a dated curio
1	i have always liked this movie . along with the horror , there 's some comedy thrown in .
1	this video is great for the beginners and the advanced beginners . i started taking a vinyasa class and was unable to coordinate my schedule with class times so i looked for a video to supplement my practice at home . what a great choice . baron baptiste takes his time to explain the poses and provides the mood that is needed to practice yoga at home . i highly recommend this dvd
0	i was purchasing rockin ' wheels ( the one with the train and fire truck ) for my son , and the truck adventures came up as a combo deal with a discount if you bought them together . we borrowed the rockin ' wheels dvd from the library and he liked it so much , i thought it would be good to have two different ones . however , the truck adventures is not as good , and my son does n't even ask to watch it . the songs are lame and so is the narrator . do n't bother
1	i love this movie . it 's picture perfect in a life of a tweeker and their enviroment . where is the soundtrack to this movie ? ? ? ? ?
1	i bought this dvd because i was getting sick of the other dvd 's that claim to be pilates workouts . this pilates work out is very imformative and very beneficial . i am actually seeing results from this workout after only 3 weeks . karen also keeps you motivated to continue . not to mention the benefit of getting two 50 minute workouts for the price of one . beware that you need a resist-a-ring for one of the workouts though , and those can be difficult to find . great , great workout and i would recommend it to anyone
1	the series just keeps on getting better . the bob newhart show was one of the best comedies ever on television . the other funny show was `` newhart '' , which i can not understand why it has not been released on dvd . the whole cast just clicks . i wish shows like this were still on television . if you enjoy a good laugh then buy this and the other sets !
1	until sam raimi made spider-man , i think we all regarded tim burton 's batman as the best superhero movie ( even though i actually do n't consider batman to be a `` superhero '' because he has no superpowers ) . burton directed this movie , and did a great job - this movie looks like it takes place in the 1920s , except that society is a lot more technologically advanced than it really was back then . michael keaton is batman/bruce wayne . needless to say , batman is wayne 's alter ego . keaton is magnificent at playing the character 's alter ego . keaton also does a good job playing the character when he 's not in costume . keaton 's bruce wayne is n't as gloomy as christian bale 's was in batman begins , which is n't necessarily a bad thing . but i would say bruce wayne was a little too cheerful for my liking in the schumacher movies . but overall , bale 's bruce wayne is superior to keaton 's because bale has a much more developed character to play . however , keaton plays a better costumed batman than bale . the problem with this movie is that the joker ( jack nicholson ) steals the show - the whole movie revolves around him , so this is n't batman 's movie . this movie should have been called `` the joker . '' so if you ever wondered why nicholson got a higher billing than keaton , now you know . the thing is , the writers never bothered to give bruce wayne a personality , and they barely scratch the surface of the character 's background - we know practically nothing about wayne . you 'd think the guy that 's batman would n't be so uninteresting , but we 're bored to tears everytime wayne 's onscreen ( and out of costume ) . but when keaton is onscreen in the batman costume , batman seems so menacing and captivating that you enjoy all of his scenes . he plays an even more menacing batman than bale - so i say that keaton does a better batman than bale , but that bale does a better bruce wayne than keaton . but keaton did n't have anything to work with , so it 's not his fault his bruce wayne is so weak . but one of the strengths of keaton 's performance is that if you ever met wayne , he 'd seem like the last guy in the world that could be batman . that 's something kilmer and clooney failed to accomplish , but thankfully bale was able to do it . michael gough is a delight as the old butler alfred . it 's hard to believe gough was a villain in so many horror movies over the years . i assumed michael caine 's alfred would n't compare to gough 's , but i was wrong - they 're both great . pat hingle was really good ( as commissioner gordon ) in this movie . hingle and gough were in all four movies of the original series , and i enjoyed them both in batman returns . but in batman forever i did n't like them nearly as much , and in batman robin i found their characters annoying as hell . vicki vale 's ( kim basinger ) investigation into bruce wayne 's background is completely uninteresting . but i already knew what she would find out , so maybe that 's why i did n't like those scenes . i also found the vicki character annoying , screaming in terror every three seconds she was onscreen . there 's lots of little things i love in this movie . the sight of batman rising off the ground after the two muggers shoot him , ( and the terrified expression of the gunmen ) with elfman 's dramatic music blaring . the look on napier 's face when he sees the emptied safe . when the guy got fried by the joker 's joy-buzzer ( one of the worst deaths i 've ever seen in a movie ) . when the mimes close in on the press conference and unleash a surprise , and the joker 's speech right before a mob boss dies . the first action news report of the movie . the way `` urgent '' is written in messy crayon on the parcel . when batman jumps through the skylight ( accompanied by elfman 's music ) . the design of the batmobile - minor changes make the car even cooler in batman returns . when the batmobile speeds toward the batcave ( again , elfman 's music is awesome ) . the grin on the young jack napier . the batmobile attacking the chemical factory . the joker 's facial expressions when he speaks in the microphone right after throwing lots of money to the crowd . when the bat signal is lit - but it 's not as awesome as the first time it 's lit in batman returns , or when it 's lit at the end of mask of the phantasm . and now a few complaints . this movie featured too many songs by prince . after a while , they get unbearably annoying . there were lots of other great `80s pop songs that could have ( and should have ) been used in this movie . another thing is the joker seems completely helpless without his goons to back him up . so i found the final showdown at the bell tower a little boring . by the way , you can tell that nicholson 's make-up job would look a lot more realistic in this day and age of filmmaking . burton 's batwing is cooler than schumacher 's batwing ( but not as cool as the one in mask of the phantasm ) . anyway , the targeting system of burton 's batwing seems a little screwed up - batman has a big red target locked on the joker , but the plane 's missiles and machine guns miss their target . and the joker did n't even try to get out of the way ! looks like batman paid the price of designing his own weapon systems . i always overlooked this movie 's flaws ( until i saw batman begins ) for two reasons . first of all , i found keaton 's batman to be so cool and the joker to be so entertaining that i absolutely loved this movie . second of all , the poor quality of the sequels make this movie seem a lot better than it really is . pretty much everytime the joker or the batman are n't onscreen , the movie is boring . but i must say that batman was even cooler in batman returns than he was in this movie - and nastier .
0	i loved what the bleep ? and i specifically wanted to learn more about 'creating your day ' . this video teaches nothing about how to create your day - nothing . it 's just ramtha ( jz knight ) talking about the fact that you can create your day . i heard you in the movie ! i bought this to give me some additional insights into how to create my day . it does not teach any how whatsoever . do not buy this video ! buy `` the secret '' @ thesecret.tv . buy `` the attractor factor '' by joe vitale . buy `` wealth beyond reason '' by bob doyle . do not buy this video
0	why did they even bother transferring this movie to dvd ? seriously ? the [ ... ] child of a masterpiece , `` the vanishing '' sports some of the most half-hearted performances and sometimes downright hilarious performances of the 90 's . this is n't a matter of comparison . this movie , all by itself , just sucks . if i had n't seen the original i 'd just think , `` what a brilliant plot , too bad they decided to bury it ( no pun intended ) with everything else in the movie '' . jeff bridges manages an unintentional bust a gut type performance as the sociopathic professor ; his accent is so forced and ridiculous that one wonders occasionally if this a parody of that great , gut wrenchingly disturbing , hitchcockian 1988 movie . sandra bullock and kiefer sutherland are themselves , which add nothing to the movie . and the ending . oh , the ending . we 've been cheated . totally cheated . all the power that this clunker might have had is torn away in a fervor of `` it has to be upbeat ! '' hollywood cornball syndrome . sandra bullock is rescued , the villain is hit with a shovel , and everything is a-ok ! even though kiefer sutherland 's original girlfriend has been buried alive and suffocated . this is [ ... ] of a great movie .
0	when i first got this disc the other day , it would not play at all . i installed the latest firmware update to my xbox360 hd drive , and it played . however , it does not play well at all . the video is constantly `` dragging '' or skipping . the audio is fine though . i ca n't really provide a review of the content since , so far , it is unwatchable . this is the only disc that has given me issues
0	after viewing the avengers with emma peel , which i do every evening after the dreadful news , enjoying repeats and repeats as well , with reluctance i played the hospital dvd . i thought it was terrible . the diagogue idiotic . i could not help but laugh when scott attacked diana . emma peel would have thrown him across the room . i had to play a few episodes of emma peel in the avengers series to cleanse me of this disappointing and terrible hospital dvd . the lovely diana rigg is a great actress and an extremely intelligent woman , and i was saddened that diana after all those wonderful and exciting avengers collection , with her unrivaled beauty and possessing the most beautiful voice and able to do her own stunts took on this dismal role in the hospital dvd . i see that this dvd was dated 1971 , this was only 4 years after her last avenger episodes dated 1967 . in hospital , i believe she was 33 years old . oh well , i will cleanse myself of this hospital dvd and devote an eveningr to a few episodes of the avengers with the lovely diana rigg as emma peel . finall , john steed would have been shocked to see how emma reacted to george scott the doctor . can you imagdine if john steed appeared in the hospital dvd to collect diana rigg and ride off into the sunset as they do after an avenger episode . perhaps they will issue hospital 11 , and bringr in john steed and a few other great actors of that series . robert lyons reno , nevad
1	hollywood make them , then they break them -- stars can fall as fast as they rise . sometimes they rise again , and sometimes they disappear . and christopher guest casts a jaded eye on the fickle ups and downs of hollywood in `` the big picture , '' a quirky , cynical movie which focuses on what the successful should never let go of . it has a few awkward stretches , but overall it 's a darkly witty cult comedy ( `` you 're tracking failure all over my carpet ! '' ) . nick chapman ( kevin bacon ) is the winner at an arty student movie competition , and instantly agents are chasing him all over l.a . in no time , he 's the rising young director , with a movie deal at a major movie corporation . but he 's also starting to lose sight of his old life , as he tries to become a major success . he changes the style , plot and characters of his arty movie for demographics , turning it into a beach bums/naked ghost movie . he dumps his pretty girlfriend ( emily longstreth ) for a bimbo actress ( teri hatcher ) . when the studio head gets dropped , nick falls as quickly as he rose . but a chance encounter with an old pal gives him a second chance -- an arty music video . this time , can he get it right ? christopher guest is best known for his brilliant mockumentaries , tackling everything from small-town musicals to folk festivals . his forthcoming one is another one about showbiz . but his talents are just as present in a `` typical '' movie , and guest does a smart , quirky job of it . the lesson : be true to yourself and your art , do n't fall for empty glitz , and do n't let success go to your head if you 're lucky enough to get it . the story is a pretty straightforward one -- nick gets great success , it goes to his head , he falls , and he rises again a wiser man . and the movie falls into straightforward lines , without many unpredictable plot twists . at first glance , it does n't seem that unusual . what makes it special ? well , simply put , guest manages to infuse it with his unique type of wit , like the oddballish pez music video and the noir fantasies of nick 's life . not to mention the glorious dialogue . when speaking of nick 's one'n'only music video , a studio woman announces , `` it 's the best one yet , and i 've seen 'em all ! '' and guest manages to show us agents , artists , students , directors and actors , but never descended to cliches . they 're real people , no matter how nasty . and bacon does a solid job as a young man who learns how empty glitz is . his best scene is the reunion with his friend emmet , where he confesses , `` i wan na be your friend again . '' and he 's backed by good performances by longstreth , michael mckean and a dancing jennifer jason leigh . `` big picture '' treads where many movies have gone before , but it does so with an approach as fresh as a pez people music video . a must-see
1	this is a fine , leveled workout , including stretching , aerobics , abdominal exercises and strength training moves ( without weights ) . gilad takes you through it with plenty of advance cues and tips to help you change moves smoothly , and position yourself properly for optimum muscle and cardiac work . the 30 minute workout is just right for an early-morning , before work routine . the 60 minute version is an extended workout good for weekends . much better than most of these videos , this is particularly well suited to middle aged fitness buffs .
0	therese , lux , mary , bonnie and cecilia make up the five lisbon girls , ages 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 and 17 . cecilia , the youngest , lives in her sisters shadows because they are all older and of much more interest to their male neighbors . as a cry for help , she slits her wrists and lays down in the bathtub , she survived the incident . after a psychiatrist highly impresses upon the strict mr. and mrs. lisbon that it would be benificial for cecilia to be exposed to environments which have boys her own age , mr. and mrs. lisbon decide to allow the girls to throw the one and only lisbon party . some of the neighborhood 's boys are invited over and while the party is in session , cecilia is pretty inanimate , sitting on the couch while her sisters flirt , talk and laugh . midway through the party , cecilia asks to be excused and mrs. lisbon - though somewhat reluctantly - allows it . cecilia goes up to her room ( on the second floor of a two-story house ) and jumps out the window , landing on the spiked fence on the front lawn of the lisbon house . in this way , cecilia lisbon commited suicide . only four girls remain . the act which cecilia committed did not go at all unnoticed . the father saw her immediately , the party ended there and all of the boys went home rather glum . four of the lisbon 's neighbors , four young boys , suffered a rapidly growing obsession with the lisbon girls , who were beautiful and a total mystery to the outside world . they got hold of cecilia 's diary and tried to explain why she committed suicide . the eldest decided cecilia was a dreamer , and she did not think she would fall when she jumped out her window , she thought she would fly . with their youngest sister gone , the remaining lisbon girls grow closer to each other , stranding themselves further from the outside world . when school starts again , they attempt to go on acting as if nothing happened , not ever mentioning their youngest sister . the run-of-the-mill awkward act is taken part by the rest of the school however . the usual profuse apology to the mention of the word `` death '' and the like . trip fontaine is the most popular guy in school , the object of desire to all of the girls at school ... except for the lisbon girls , which is of no importance to trip until he sets eyes on lux . trip can not help but be enchanted by her flawless beauty . in the beginning , he is unsuccessful in his quest to even catch her attention for she bluntly shows she 's not interested . but after his consistent courtship , lux falls for his charming ways . trip then attempts to convince mr. lisbon to let him and three of his football team pals take the lisbon daughters to homecoming . after mr. lisbon talks to his wife , he agrees to trip 's request , knowing nothing but trip 's sincerity and claimed honorable intentions , on the understanding that trip have all of the lisbon girls returned to the house by curfew . after trip explains the situation to his football peers , he gives in to those who bribe him the most handsomely . meanwhile , the lisbon girls are picking out fabric for the dresses they shall wear to the homecoming dance . though one pattern is used for all four dresses , each dress looks unique when concentrating on detail . once they pick up the girls , they stop midway to the homecoming in order to smoke , lux being the only girl volunteering to smoke . they then drive to the dance . trip and lux sneak away and sneak swallows of alcohol . another one of the lisbon sisters and her date follow , but leave soon afterwards , not being as wild nor daring as trip and lux . at the time they all decided to meet back at the car so they could make the girls curfew , they are all there ... except for trip and lux , who at that time were alone in the middle of the football stadium field . deciding they must make their own curfews , therese , bonnie , mary and their dates leave without them . after fooling around , the intoxicated trip and lux fall asleep in the middle of the football stadium . trip awakens in the middle of the night and leaves lux there alone . when lux wakes up early the next morning she is confused as to why trip is not there . she takes a taxi home and her parents were worried sick ( of course ) . but they take measures as far as pulling the girls out of school and stranding them inside the lisbon residence . the girls , in a desperate attempt to hold onto a connection to the outside world , begin using morse code to interact with the four boys who so closely follow their lives . one of which boys lived across the street and the rest which came over daily after this in order to contact the girls . soon following , the boys begin talking to the lisbon girls via phone . one day , the girls invite the boys to come over once mr. and mrs. lisbon are asleep . the plan being that the boys were to drive the girls somewhere , the boys hastily agree . they sneak over and lux invites them to wait inside for her sisters and lux goes to wait in the car . the boys wander down to the basement while waiting for therese , bonnie and mary , verbally expressing their hopes for the night . but then they realize they have stumbled upon one of the sisters . she had hung herself . the boys , scared to death , run all the way home . time passed , things changed , girls came and went ... but no matter what , those four boys never forgot the lisbon suicides . ultimately , the movie was nothing short of queer . when trying to sum up the story in a few lines ( such as `` follow the lives of the lisbon sisters and how they connect to their neighbors . a story full of obsession , gossip , lust , love , desire and isolation . '' ) the story sounds quite unique and intriguing , but the story fell short of that for me personally . partly because the lisbon sisters really committed suicide for a reason not much deeper than isolation . the movie , in places , is also extremely flawed . i do not believe mr. and mrs. lisbon could 've removed their daughters from school for so long without their daughters being taken from them by social services . in many parts of the movie , they should 've used upbeat music to fill the deafening silences . the whole movie was filmed in a style that i can truthfully say makes me rather bored . i would only suggest this film to , perhaps , people who like movies such as `` elizabethtown '' which kirsten dunst is also in . but i personally disliked this movie which was not very tasteful and will not be watching it again in the future
0	first off , robert deniro as the monster . i saw him and immediately thought of jake lamotta or vito corleone . they did n't even try to disguise his accent and no-one ever explains why the monster sounds like he just got off the plane from new york . second , kenneth brannagh was so in love with the set that he forgot about story . finally the scene where elizabeth was ressurected was ridiculous . frankenstien 's shock that she 's not happy to be back -- burnt up , cut of and her heart pulled out of her chest -- was supposed to be touching but i laughed . we all know how great kenneth brannagh is but he got completely carried away here and the result was really , really , really bad . i give it two stars for the pretty costumes and utter magnificence of aidan quinn 's face .
0	seriously , i am an expert , and this movie sucks . but , imagine for a moment -- yes , stop and withdraw from your metaphysical prejudices -- a movie whose premise is truly profound , strikingly engaging , and culturally challenging -- that art is only such relative to those individuals , those `experts ' , whose tastes , likes and dislikes , decide it so . given that aesthetic claims are empirically nonsensical -- a matter of pure subjective opinion -- why is it that some art is valued at all while some not at all ? besides this interesting question , which is put forth explicitly , without the pretentious riddles of terrible poetry , and in about 60 seconds , the rest of the movie is obnoxious editing and narration . avoid at all costs .
1	this is a showcase of jet li 's brand of martial arts ... fast and furious . while this is no fist of legend the movie has enough action to keep the exitement going . what i did'nt anticipate was the humor . absolutely lots of laughs to pick up where the action stops . once persons are prepared to judge this movie on it 's own merit they will see that this movie was worth buying
1	while the dubbing may be a little annoying , i still love this movie . the fight scenes are great and the movie is pretty funny at times . driving motorcycles over cars will always be cool in my book . do n't expect the deepest movie in the world , but do expect a quality martial arts film
0	eddie murphy is a comical guy , but is he really the right guy to play in something as stupid as this ? of course , who is the right guy for it ? one of the questions i ca n't stand to think about in this movie , is how dolittle hears the animals speak , but their lips move and nobody notices . ca n't they connect the dots ? obviously not . and obviously , the filmmakers could n't either
1	my little boy who is 8 years old loves this movie . he goes around acting like the characters from the movie ! he really likes harold and keeps watching the movie over and over again hoping for a different ending . he is also convinced that they should make a midnight madness 2 and let harold win the next time ! this is a great movie , with a young michael j . fox in it , and has no sex or violence and is a very kid friendly movie
1	this is a great movie and i got it sent to me in a reasonable time and it was a wonderful service thank you very much
1	backing up the review that pointed out m. night shyamalan 's earlier films the other movie is titled praying with anger ( also did screen play for stuart little ) . all three movies in the box set are great and worth watching again and again
0	the unbearable lightness of being was considered an unfilmable novel for a good reason : the point of kundera 's writing is not his plot - or even his characters - but his style . for instances , his endless digressions about history , politics , and philosophy . for the movie , we are left with nothing but plot and character . ok , what is one to do ? that in itself would n't be so bad if i did n't watch the film with the constant thought : i could read the book in less time than it takes me to watch this movie . this is a slow film . it takes an hour-and-a-half story and takes three hours to tell it . i ca n't recommend the film
1	this original version is much funnier than u.s. version . the humor is dry and intelligent , and the characters are very complex : at times , you feel sorry for them ; other times , you love them and laugh with them ; and mostly , you think they 're idiots . what a talented group of actors and comedians to create such a complexity of emotion in an audience . it 's not often i can watch a dvd or series over and over , but this is one that i 've enjoyed each time
1	... but the movie was pretty good . i found myself highly disappointed in the book , and almost was n't able to finish it . the characters were flat , the story reading like a history lesson in religion through the ages , and not a true story , so i was n't sure what to make of the movie . i was pleasantly surprised though , to enjoy the movie immensely . it was long , but it kept the pace going throughout . the subtitling in the latin and french was a bit mundane to drudge through , but it made the movie a bit more 'believable ' than everyone speaking english when the main character is actually french . teabing was played brilliantly , and while hanks was not who i would have thought for langdon , he did a superb job in the role . if you can set your personal beliefs aside and view the movie as a piece of exceptional fiction drama and suspense , it is well worth watching . murder , mystery , suspense , action , drama ... it 's all there in this film
1	i bought this as a christmas gift for someone . it came in the mail very quickly , i had no problems with it , and the person i gave it to loved it
1	the thesis of guns , germs and steel gives the most logical explanation for the inequality in development in the world today . not based on one group of people being inherently smarter than other groups , but based on a group of people favored by their environment and other factors ... ..very interesting theory that should be given more study .
0	this edition of the film sucks and sucks again . the wide screen version of this is a masterpiece - without the widescreen ratio this edition can not be true to the comic book sensibility that bava intended . each shot was carefully composed ( and not intended to be butchered ) - this edition is a travesty -- especially when it 's purported to be put out by fans - do you 're homework . there are also scenes missing from this print , scenes that are important and add to the overall ambience . hey i thought the folks behind this were enthusiasts -- instead its just sloppy and self indulgent . look for the earlier laser disc edition ... ... ... .. as for the extras do we really need the - it 's great because i used it in my video slop ... . and it 's great because i did a bad homage/rip-off slop . the documentary in the extras takes great pains to point out that this film was intended to look like a comic book and that 's what was great about it . then when you watch the film what you get is less than a third of the original image ! strikes me a total scumminess . all in a all a fabulous opportunity wasted ... by a few lazy lard-asses with a quick-fix mentality .
1	i thought the video was well done . it was good to feature the clinching games of the division and league championship series plus all four games of the world sries . i think they should have included at least the high- lights on a extra disk of games 1 and 2 of the division series against boston and games 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 of the league championship series against los angeles . still , i highly recommend this collection for all gung-ho white sox fans who cherish the memory of the most exciting season in 88 years . a great viewing companion for those cold winter nights
0	every lakers fan i 've ever met lives in the past sadly now . to them , the clock stopped when kareem and magic hung up the shoes [ and we know why magic had to leave ] . their basketball knowledge from the 60s to the 90s is rewarding . after this , however , they do n't have a clue of what has happened to this once mighty and moral organization . the lakers have been a good team over the decades [ as apparent on this dvd set ] , but the run of greatness is coming to a long slide with kobe driving the bus . the lakers were once considered the green bay packers of the nfl , but now they 're just lucky to even get close to a playoff spot over a majority of the teams in the western conference which are much better than the present lakers . i recently attended a game last fall at the staples center , and besides all of the celebs eating hummus in the stands , i could barely hear myself think over phil jackson 's mantra `` i told you so . '' further illustrating how things have changed in la , jack nicholson has become embarrassed to wear anything purple or yellow . so it is understandable that laker fans would rather focus on the achievements of magic and kareem , than rather extol the diminishing skills of kobe since his colorado folly . there are some good games on this dvd along with great moments from the baylor , chamberlain , west days . i recommend any laker fan to purchase this dvd set to relive the past . so laker fans , keep living in the past if you so desire . maybe kobe will retire and become a man of the cloth and lead the lakers to the nba championship promised land once again . long live the forum [ or the staple remover center ] or whatever they are calling the lakers home now
1	i normally do not enjoy movies about the making of movies , so i was very pleasantly surprised to be thoroughly entertained by 'living in oblivion ' . the reason i took the chance at all was due to the presence of catherine keener , one of our most overlooked and under-appreciated hollywood actresses . she once again did not disappoint , but the entire cast was extremely good . you get a real education on the frustrations and challenges involved with making a low budget film . buscemi is also right on target as the stessed out director . the amazon reviews are for the most part positive about this film and for good reason . i 'm glad to join my fellow amazonians in heaping praise on this low budget gem
1	after i watched this sequel i realized it was not as good as the first but i did enjoy it .

1	this is a great dvd for all collections even if the movie stank which it did not . the package is worth the coin .
1	i liked this movie when i first saw it and i seen it about 10 times ... i like to watch any movie that involves gangs ( especially bloods crips ) so i can learn from them ... if you 're looking or are just a collector like me of gang movies ... you may not want this one in your collection ... becuase to me , it does n't show enough bloods crips in it ... . the characters are fictional ... .there are some minor gangs in it as well called the white fences ( latino/hispanic gang - i 've never heard of this gang , so i do n't know if they are true or not. ) . the actors who play the gang members of the white fences are good actors though ... i think they are better then don cheadle and wayans who play crip members ... this movie centers more on white fence and their rivalry w/ crips ... there 's not too much focus on bloods in here ... it also more focuses on sean penn 's character and robert duvall too ( good cop/bad cop ) , and penn on how he falls in love w/ a former gangmember woman in the white fence gang . colors is a good watch ... i just wish it had more gang focus in it ... and more gang sets ( chapters , i.e . eight tray gangsters , hoover , etc ... ) if you 're looking for a good gang buy , buy the book `` monster '' by sanyika shakur a.k.a . monster kody scott , or `` do or die '' by leon bing . those 2 books far surpasses this movie..
0	im sure ill here alot from this review but everyone giving this movie 5 stars i dont see how or why.have you people just been introduced to the movie world ? this movie is awful between the bad acting and the annoying music playing during talking scenes its flat out frustrating.rusty james brother in this movie acts like a mental case for you peole that havent seen this he dies in the end ( i just saved you an hour and a half of your life cause now you wont have to waste it on this crappy movie ) .between the bad music the bad acting and the plot/storyline going all over the place in this movie its seriously like being on a bad acid trip.what a waste of money and time on this one.ill donate mine to goodwill or the garbage can..not worthy of my movie collection
0	denzel washington is probably my favorite actor . even in that dog of a movie called the manchurian candidate , he shone . tom hanks ? well , lem me quit hating the guy . this is a well-intentioned movie , tom did a creditable job , and we had extreme close-ups with funny colors to camouflage the spots where he overreached . i was also pleasantly surprised to see antonio banderas fly in the face of his latino studliness by playing a gay guy . a passionate one , though , since he 's still a latino , after all . actually , this is a hollywood `` message movie , '' and you know what that means . it 's about as subtle as michael moore . those who agree with the message flock to be beaten about the head by it for two hours . those who the filmmakers would like to see the movie , those who do n't agree with the message , stay as far away from it as possible . there 's a scene in the library where nobody wants to sit at the table with aids boy . the way they stared at him reminded me of `` lao wei in china '' experiences . denzel 's character was reminded of segregation , even though he 's too young to remember it , and started to care about tom hanks ' character . aids discrimination is bad . actually , any discrimination at all is bad . and that 's the movie 's message . i agree with the message , but still . that 's all we 've got . as a totally irrelevant non-sequiter , if the name `` sam francisco '' means anything to you , you 've seen subtle commentary on discrimination . i love a great courtroom drama . this one was merely good . with so much of an agenda to squeeze into a two-hour film , they had to take a few shortcuts here . sad , ai n't it ? but even so , a well-intentioned film that i 'm glad i saw . once . not twice . once is enough , thank you .
0	i was fortunate not to spend any money specifically on this movie . i could n't get past the first 15 minutes ... incoherent beginning , and overly stylized particularly where ashe becomes `` the avenger '' ( for lack of a better name ) . nothing like the original at all , which i love by comparison
1	the transfers of the 5 movies found here are worth every penny ! we grew up watching these on philadelphia 's channel 17 with show host dr . shock and the creature double features back in the mid 70 's . the pictures were always so dark and grainy , well not anymore folks ! universal has done an amazing job on the picture clean-up and sound restoration ! bright and crystal clear along with wonderful sound ! also a very nice fold out dvd holder ! the theatrical trailers were transferred in their original release condition which will allow you to compare how good of a job was done on the restoring of the movies to dvd ! do n't wait to long in purchasing your set at a cheap price , they have already disappeared off of store shelves in our area !
0	i was disappointed in this video . i came to it not as a devout catholic but as a fan of travel videos . in other words , i watched this video with the same motivation i would have to watch shackleton 's antarctic exploration , or something from the globe trekker series . with that in mind , the target audience for this video is not me . it is the religious catholic . therefore , from my perspective , i ca n't recommend it . i 'm not one for all the pomp and circumstance of religion . i do n't enjoy worshipping the `` holy father '' , or watching the construction of the clownish uniform of the swiss guard . if you are a devout catholic you will probably enjoy this video . if you are not , and just came to the video because you wanted a globe trekker style tour of the vatican , you are likely to be disappointed . and that is what these reviews are for - to let you know whether you will enjoy the video or not
1	i have been following the laughing man fansubs , so i 've covered all this material before . i 'm acquiring the dvds as they come out to have legit copies . the desc says 2 collectibles toys , it 's actually 3 . there is batou on the plate like motoko from vol 3 . in fact , the base plates fit together , which makes me belive that vol 5 will have another piece that will fit together to complete a composite set . the other two toys are the chinese assassin with the gun-arm and the old robot unit from the organ-farming business ( with the fake southern accent ) . these are easier to put together , i had problems with the tachikoma from the last set , it broke when i tried to put the legs on . have n't gotten around to the super-glue session yet . the product itself : stand alone complex - 2nd gig continues some of the best animation and smartest television ever produced . buy it , share it with those persons worthy/capable of appreciating it
1	the direction was a grade acting top class and to top it you had eric and clint eastwood .eric fleming was mindblowing .one has yet to come across an actor with his confidence class and authority .yes i agree we always tend to focus on clint forgetting that it was eric who was mile ahead of him.todays generation has to watch these episodes in black and white to understand the beauty of this great western.yes the fact is without rawhide there would be no clint eastwood
1	this movie is funny and by being so bold in so many ways is refreshing . it presents realistic characters without worrying about offending people by presenting sterotypes . it takes the time to develope the story effectively without boring the audience . it is a long movie but it moves at a great and effective pace . it is full of laughs . joe pesci is one of the best comic actors of all time . i do n't think that anyone else could have pulled of the part of vinny nearly as well . marisa was great as well and it was hard to find a performance that was less than great . the writing and directing , two things that often get overlooked , was wonderful . the only weakness ? the case is a little fantastic . it is hard to believe the coincidences in the movie that lead to the boys being accused of the crime . of course movie plots do n't have to make perfect sense but this stretches it . though i usually do n't like excessive foul language , this movie uses it in a funny way . i guess it would n't work without it ... but do n't be mistaken ... .it has a lot of bad language . do n't let kids under 17 watch it without supervision
0	saw `` hart 's war '' the other night and could n't really believe anyone would invest money and time in a film as awful as this one . this film bombed at the box office and was yanked from circulation after only a few days . here are ten reasons why : 1 . this film is n't `` the great escape '' and even though he would probably like to think otherwise , bruce willis is n't steve mcqueen . even though willis received top billing , this is a colin farrell vehicle . 2 . the vast majority of the target audience of 18-34 year old moviegoing males could care less about what happened during the reagan administration , much less world war ii . `` hart 's war '' may just as well be a film about a pow camp during the war of 1812 . anything with vin diesel or the rock would be bound to sell more tickets . 3 . as far as depicting life in a pow camp , `` hart 's war '' is pretty much on par with `` hogan 's heroes '' . the germans are nice guys with guns who do n't know very much and everyone gets away with just about anything . where did the gi 's get all those cigarettes , anyway ? 4 . any stalag luft comandant worth his weight in sauerkraut would have just as soon killed the bruce willis character as look at him . as depicted in `` hart 's war '' , the camp commandant ( as portrayed by marcel lures ) would have had a very difficult time maintaining any sort of status as an officer in the german army . his collection of american jazz/blues records is a cute writer 's invention that has nothing to do with the reality of the situation , or of the type of men who were in charge of german pow camps . in reality , the marcel lures character would probably have been relegated to another type of nazi camp with a pink triangle sewn on the front of his tunic . 5 . the storyline is not completely unbelievable - trials did take place in pow camps , one good example being the pow 's who were tried and hung in andersonville ; however , the whole idea that the camp 's commandant would actively participate in such a trial as sort of a jerry springer type advocate is ludicrous . 6 . the idea that during the trial , a group of pow 's who escape go on a secret mission to destroy a nearby munitions factory is insulting . not only did nothing like this ever happen during world war ii , it degrades the bravery of those poor souls whose only act of heroism was to survive internment under harsh and sometimes brutal conditions . the german army simply was n't that stupid . 7 . i saw this film once and did n't like it . i thought that maybe the second time would be better . it was n't . 8 . beyond being sheer hollywood political correctness , `` hart 's war '' seriously misrepresents many of the more important aspects of internment . it ignores the real focus of life in such a stalag which , for most pow 's , was just day to day survival . also , the soldiers who served in our armed forces during world war ii and also happened to be african americans were n't spineless , hapless dopes . 9 . bruce willis playing the same role in variations of `` die hard '' over and over and over again is tiring . 10 . better films about the same sort of subject matter are `` the tuskeegee airmen '' and `` stalag 17 '' . hopefully in a few years , `` hart 's war '' will be completely forgotten , and these dvd 's will be rotting in some landfill .
1	i love this movie it is a `` comfort '' movie for me as this was one of my favs as a kid and i still love it today
1	pro + great story , teriffic acting , beautiful setting con - some pacing flaws , but not enough to destroy the whole lindsay duncan is perfectly cast as the guardian of this endangered photographic archive and liam cunningham is her well-cast , perfunctory foil . as as the story unfolds , the differences between british and american style ( and culture ) are revealed , providing a nice subtext to the plot . one of the viewing pleasures is in discovering that not everything is as it appears , from the central story to the character 's lives . good actors all . but my `` best actor '' award goes to the photographs themselves : the stories they tell and the feelings they evoke are haunting and captivating all at once . a visually rich film
1	these 10 minute workout combos are great for any busy mom since you can do one , two or three depending on how much time you have and how tired you are !
1	the freshman is a very funny movie . the central joke is that marlon brando plays a godfather type figure in lower manhattan who for obvious reasons looks exactly like the titular character brando so famously portrayed . matthew broderick is the freshman , an innocent nyu film student , who through some comedic misadventures gets involved with brando and his `` family '' . the funniest scenes involve a komodo dragon loose in a new jersey shopping mall though the whole film is a delightful comedy . the movie has no real violence and though there are a few mild `` bad '' words the movie is fairly appropriate for viewing by older kids and families .

0	these are not the original theatrical realeases . in addition to the changes made in the special edition versions of the films , american cinematographer noted in their review of the dvd release that they had gone so far as to change the color-timing of the transfer so that the color scheme more closely resembled the more recent prequels . though they are an impressive technical achievement , i 'll be buying the academy award winning films that i saw when i was younger
0	is anyone else having issues with these discs ? when you first place the discs in the player , it skips over the main menus . then the `` menu '' button will only start and stop the episode selected , but it will not return you to the main menu . there is no spanish or portuguese dubbed audio on the discs ( despite what the menus and packaging claim ) and the episodes automatically play with spanish subtitles even when the subtitles are turned `` off . '' the only way to avoid this is to choose `` other '' subtitles with the remote . this appears to be an authoring issue , as i am using a two year-old sony dream system dvd player and have not had these issues with previous seasons . i 'm exchanging my discs immediately , but i have a feeling they might all be bad . anyone else hear about these issues
1	in sanskrit , ayurveda means the study of life . according to ancient hindu texts , all healing systems stem from ayurvedic medicine . this ancient ayurveda series dvd , led by sarah tomlinson with clarity and insight , provides a blueprint for increasing self-awareness through the use of asana , symbol and metaphor . tomlinson , acts like a loving guide to going inward and discovering new self-truths . to effectively bring about change in our bodies and minds , we must change habitual patterns in the body . the poses in the series takes us through a full range of challenging movements , and tomlinson illuminates the wisdom of this practice by brilliantly threading together how the poses evoke certain states of mind and spirit . filmed against a simple , soothing background , tomlinson wisely avoids distracting bells and whistles . instead , the accompanying chanting by ayurveda master gandharva , directly relates to the series in it 's use of each of the planetary mantras . tomlinson 's has a great depth of knowledge about ayurveda , and she weaves many subtle suggestions and information about the benefits of each pose into the practice . this dvd is appropriate for beginner and advanced student : beginners will feel supported and encouraged , as well as exhilirated by the practice , and more experienced students will appreciate the multi-level aspect of tomlinson 's class . l. landau , teacher and student
0	this movie was awfull . supertroopers was awsome and beerfest was even better , so i suppose they can be forgiven for this cinematic abortion
0	this is the first movie i have seen whose rating slipped further the longer it played . `` eight women '' is the story of , well , eight women , who are trapped by a snowstorm -- all 5 inches of it . the man of the house has been murdered in the night . young and old , black and white , of different classes , the women must try to determine who the killer is . `` eight women '' is also a movie about secrets , of which everyone seems to have several . the plot has more twists and turns than an alpine road on the tour de france . yet the first 2/3 of the film is tolerable , funny and even a bit interesting . the characters are self-interested and fun . there 's dotty old grandma , a prissy , hysterical virgin aunt , the dead man 's vampish sister and coltish young maid , two daughters , a somber yet elegant wife ( catherine deneuve ) and a black cook . plenty of class and age tension to make three movies . did i mention the music ? every twenty minutes or so , one of the characters breaks into song . these are always those stereotypical french songs -- full of longing and sadness and references to sleep and springtime -- that are tedious to american ears . and bizarre . while one character sings , the rest do slow little dances . strange . by the 2/3 mark , i was going to give this quirky film 4 stars . but soon , the plot line spun out of control , getting more and more manic until it finally derailed completely with a tragic ending . definitely not recommended unless you are desperate need of a bizarre experience .
1	i watched this dvd in one of my classes and it left me feeling hoplessly hopeless ! i really dont know what to think about the whole presentation . the presence of chomsky makes it look reputable but who knows , he might have been taken out of context although it seemed not . if what they claim about corporations is true , then we are getting ready to implode in one way or another.i 'll keep away from political lines and just suggest that you watch it and decide ... i had given it a rating of 3 but just changed it to 4 . the material is more plausible than otherwise
0	two of the worst stories in the history of tos , but for different reasons . the 'way to eden ' makes the mistake of trying to be trendy , and so dates badly . what the real problem is though is that it makes the enterprise crew seem to be the disapproving establishment , especially of all people captain kirk . 'requiem for methuselah ' is at heart a reasonable story with the assertion that one man could be responsible for the work of da vinci , brahms and others . what it completely fails to do is have any appreciation for kirk 's relationships with women . threre is no way any woman would have kirk obsessed to the point he would fight for her , he is far to full of his own importance for that . this effectively trashes any credibility that the story would have had because this is the crux of the whole episode . a real pity
1	this is the best `` la traviata . '' i was so moved that i had to take a break . it really touched me deeply !
0	i was surprised that so many people childishly attacked the person who gave this movie one-star . someone even accused them of not being young at heart . well , i do n't like this film , and i 'm young at heart ; i 'm just not immature , so try not to confuse the two . some of you need to check your spelling before accusing someone else of bad writing . having said that , on to the film : julie and friends are simply dying to be included in the in-crowd their first year of high school , so on the night julie has a sleepover , they make a deal with some rival girls to go on a `` scavenger '' hunt , which is basically one huge dare game . the group that fulfills the dares first get to be popular by ... ( drumroll , please ) sitting at the popular lunch spot . that is , a picnic bench by the school fountain . that 's right ; popularity is not guaranteed by who you sit with , but where you sit . pick the right spot , and you may just magically become queen bee for the rest of the year . in case you could n't tell by my sarcasm , the shallow impracticality of this film truly bugs me at times . we all know the whole popularity thing is practically a tradition for teen chick-flicks , but this film tended to go over the top with a lot of it . granted , a lot of the exaggerated silliness worked for the film ; in fact , the movie 's beginning surprised me with many clever and well-written clips . however , there is such a thing as going too far . the movie becomes absolutely dedicated to making teen girls look like sassy but fashionably ingenuis bimbos and making teen boys look like ... well , the dumbest , scruffiest beings that ever stumbled on the planet . not that all the boys are like this , mind you ; there are a few of the god-like types that the girls practically kill themselves for . it got worse , however , when the film attempted to fit in a few serious scenes . if the movie had stuck to pure sarcastic silliness the whole time , it might 've worked . instead , the few attempts to be serious usually fell flat on their faces because the seriousness went in the wrong direction . for example , there was the nauseating scene where poor beaten julie nearly gives up her scavenger hunt and one of her friends says , `` julie , i know you can do this ; i believe in you '' in a tone which implies that they 're talking about a major life crisis instead of a juvenile daredevil game . the worst `` serious '' scene , however , is when julie attempts to get into a dance ( therefore fulfilling the final dare ) and the ticket seller wo n't let her in because she does n't have a ticket . suddenly inspired , julie gives the ticket seller a sickening `` i know who you are '' speech , telling her that she knows she was a nerd her whole high school life and that now , because of her former nerdiness , she 's become a poor ticket seller . julie ends her speech by wailing , `` i can see myself being you in four years if i do n't go to this dance ! '' the ticket seller leaps to her feet but , instead of punching julie , suddenly breaks into a smile and says , `` go ahead and go in ! '' um , what ? ? whatever happened to the girls finding out that popularity is n't everything after all and actually getting lives and acting like humans ? ( not to mention that nice sock in the mouth i was hoping julie would get ) . is this what we want to teach our kids , that being dedicated to work makes them nerds and that partying all the time will get them somewhere in life ? i personally think the `` nerds '' are far better off than the girls who lose their virginity on the first date and party all year rather than learn anything . it was this scene and this message that seriously lowered the film in my opinion . i 'm not sure why the filmmakers decided to end the film with this childish message . maybe they did it on a dare because the popular filmmakers finally offered them a cool lunch spot in exchange . i recommend `` never been kissed '' and `` mean girls '' far more than this film ; they have good moral lessons as well as intelligent humor . oh , before i finish , here 's one more valuable lesson from this film : girls , if you want to win a guy who 's never noticed you , all you have to do is strike a cool pose , hop on a skateboard , and ride it directly in front of his car . ( do n't forget to wear an expensive dress and look flawless while you 're at it ) . do this , and he will be so in love with you that he wo n't even care if you tell him that you did something freakish like stealing his underwear . the things we learn from movies , huh ?
0	with so much talent on show here you would expect a lot better movie , but this is another case of the scriptwriters letting the movie down . matthew mcconaughey delivers another good performance , yet does n't stray too far from what he knows best . there is bradley cooper as his best friend who you will remember as rachel mcadams fiance in wedding crashers . patton oswalt appears in a blink and you 'll miss him scene , but the heros of the day are kathy bates and zooey deschanel who 's roles are a lot more important than the characters they play . bates is great as mcconaughey 's mother while zooey is at her sarcastic best as parker 's flatmate . parker should stick to television , she is dreadful and totally unconvincing in her role , maybe if they had cast someone else in her place there may have been a chance for this movie . a good date movie flick , the story is predictable but i would have been willing to look past that had i been entertained . special features are nothing too special . a trailer and a few dodgy featurette 's . a rainy night rental movie
1	this movie is asome its one of my favorites from the 90 's and probably my favorite plot twister/ who done it along with m night shamylans films . this movies great plot is over looked by the average americans craving desire of sex and scandal which is retarded and makes this country alittle less than great . anyway the shear sex appeal is also one of the tones that makes this movies atomasphere so great the music hits it perfect and the 2 leads are my favorite younger actress ' neve campbell and denise richards who are both perfect for they 're rolls . the whole movie is just oozing with sex appeal that combined with the story makes it irresistable . which is unexpected from john mcnaughton as it was his first big claim to fame film . bill murray adds some much needed comic releif and the plot will keep you guessing till the end and will fool anyone even those retards from csi . the 2 girls have `` it '' in theyre rolls they just seem to fit together like a sexy peanut butter and jelly sandwhich . i was fist drawn to this film ever since i meet matt dillon at universal studios he was just asome and i had to see him act , and everyone recommended this movie for that and he was asome in it to . infact i wouldnt mind meeting the whole cast all of them are huge idols of mine and theyre all so cool . i do miss neve campbell.. i wish she 'd come back to films and it looks like she will . so if your looking for a once in a lifetime plot and an asome cast this movie has it or if your like the 99.9 % of people who have seen this and you only like it for the threesome and the pool scenes then i guess its good for that to since ive only seen the editied verison . ps dont waste ur time with the other sequals theyre stupid and repeats of this one with not so famous casts . take a look at the fist still at the bottom it sums up the whole `` it '' thing i was taking about you just feel an incredible amount of `` cool '' form that shoot , well i did anyway
1	english humor is famous for it 's eccentricities but with the exception of selected monty python you need the english pedigree to really like it . the young ones pick up where monty left off . outrageous , yet real , there is a plot line but it does n't get in the way . it 's a shame there were n't more episodes made ... .
0	one of those cases where everything goes wrong in the making of a movie : low budget , unispired performances ( alexis denisof is particularly bad here ) , lack of decent screenplay for the actors to work upon , bad direction , despisable characters , cliched situations ... how kinski chose to act in this one ?
0	there are some good things about this film -- it gives audiences an idea of how insidious the nazi propaganda machine was , for one thing . it also shows the main character , antoine moreau , a ( fictional ) famous french mime , having his eyes opened to the reality of the nazis ' 'final solution ' to the 'jewish problem ' . brought to a czech town that has been 'given to the jews ' by the nazis in order to stage a performance that will be seen by the swiss red cross delegation , hopefully persuading them that the germans are not as monstrous as they have been portrayed , moreau changes his original idea for the performance , hoping to get a 'silent ' message to the red cross that will let them know the true fate of jews ( and other 'undesirables ' ) at the hands of the nazis . i 'll briefly mention a couple of less-than-positive observations , and then get into my main problem with the film . the production values reminded me a bit of a made-for-tv movie -- and from time to time it seemed that the sound was a little out of sync with the picture . the image quality on the dvd could have been much better as well . also , the shanachie dvd release is version of the film that has been dubbed with english . this is , in the case of this film , not very well-done . the cabaret singer , for instance , comes across as completely unbelievable in that her voice does n't match her face or ethnicity in the least . everyone in the film winds up with an english accent , which detracts from any authenticity that might have been retained using subtitles instead of clumsy dubbing . another reviewer below brought up the dubbing problem as it apples to one of one of the children , stella ( portrayed by linda jablonska ) . her voice does not sound at all like that of a little girl . she develops a bit of a crush on antoine , which in itself seems like a pretty natural occurrence under the circumstances -- here is a famous artist who has come to the village to stage a show , with her as one of the leads , who is kind and supportive and friendly to her , who listens to her ideas and feelings with attention and respect . the problem i had was with one scene in particular . stella has been caught on the streets after curfew and chased by police . she bites one of them and manages to elude them by squeezing through a break in a fence . in the process of getting away , she gets muddy , scrapes herself bloody in a few places , and tears her clothing . she goes to moreau 's hotel and climbs to the ledge outside his room and taps on the window . when he opens it , he is shocked at her condition , lets her into the room , and begins to try to clean her cuts and scrapes , asking what had happened . he then draws a bath for her , so she can wash herself . as moreau sits down , still in a bit of a daze over what has happened to her , she steps into the bath . just before she pulls her dress over her head , she says to him , `no looking . ' he shakes his head to bring himself out of his daze and says `of course ' , then repairs to the adjoining bedroom , where he lies down on the bed to have a smoke , allowing her to conduct her bath in privacy . a moment later , he hears a noise and looks up to see stella emerge from the bathroom , completely naked , in a full-frontal nude shot . moreau gets up from the bed and lifts the covers , suggesting that she warm herself . she climbs into the bed ; he covers her up , and steps away to the other side of the room . there is nothing about the scene that implies that anything improper occurred . he has simply offered her care and comfort and sympathy . this shot only lasts a few seconds , but i feel that , regardless of the director 's reasoning for shooting it in the first place , it could have been left out . if the point was to show that moreau has either had morals all along , or that he has acquired them , it could have been demonstrated in a variety of other ways . earlier in the film , stella had witnessed one of her caregivers , semi-nude , in moreau 's hotel room ( stella saw this from outside ) . given her `schoolgirl crush ' on moreau , it seemed natural for her to become upset over this . as a result , however , the scene after the bath comes across as a young girl inappropriately mimicking adult sexual behaviour . this , combined with the `adult ' voice dubbed over stella 's , makes the scene even more disquieting . there are some viewers who might argue that , in europe , `standards ' involving nudity and sexuality are not as reactionary as those in the us . in many instances , i would wholeheartedly agree with them . there is much hypocrisy in the dynamics of american culture and moral values , and not a little bit of neurosis . however , the sexual objectification of children is something about which i feel very strongly ... and i think the scene in question in this film amounts to exactly that . do n't get me wrong -- i 'm not so prudish that i turn away from even full-frontal nudity in a film , if it 's not gratuitous and it 's an integral part of the storyline ... but here , it involves a prepubescent girl , and could have easily been left out . it worries me bit that this point has not been made by other reviewers . have we become so numbed in respect to nudity in films that many ca n't recognize an instance where it 's not only unnecessary , but potentially harmful ? i 'm glad i 've seen the film -- and i 'd recommend it with a bit of praise and some strong reservations , as noted above . with all of the ridiculous claims from some quarters that the holocaust never happened , i think it 's vitally important for films on the subject to be made and seen . the czech film all my loved ones is an excellent film about this horrible time that has not gotten the attention it deserves -- seek it out . n.b . -- this is the second time i have posted this exact review . i noticed today ( 6 april 2006 ) that it has , for some reason , been removed from the site . i 've re-read what i 've written , and i do n't see anything objectionable or offensive . the issues i have with the film are discussed straightforwardly . if anyone objects to anything i 've written here , i 'd like to know what it is .
1	there are n't many films from any era that come close to being `` perfect '' ( though that 's not really the right word ) in just about every way -- probably you could count them on your fingers and have some left over . `` friendly persuasion '' is one of those films -- in spades . directed by william wyler and starring gary cooper , dorothy mcguire , and tony perkins , it is a wonderful , human story about a loving family of quakers ( also known as friends ) living in one of the union-confederate `` border '' states at the time of the civil war in the 1860s . the cast , in small roles and large , is uniformly excellent , none calling attention to themselves but rather becoming their characters and making us understand them . led by beloved , legendary star gary cooper in a great performance as the head of the quaker family jess birdwell , they are marvelous , including child actor richard eyer as feisty `` little jess '' , scrapping with his big sister or partaking in a running feud with `` samantha '' , his mother eliza birdwell 's pet goose , who more than carries her end of the feud with scene-stealing craftiness . there are incidents of family humor and love and occasional disagreements , and a hilarious episode in which eldest son josh ( perkins ) accompanies father jess on a sales trip and is set upon by the scrappy , amorous daughters of one of jess 's customers ( marjorie main ) . we are settled into a lovely , lively exploration of the birdwell family 's idyllic existence . then the war intrudes . josh feels he must volunteer to fight as long as others have to , even though it is against the teachings of his faith . his younger sister loves a young union officer who is soon to go into battle . rebel troops are nearing the region where they live , and no one , including the audience , quite knows what will happen . there is a beautifully honest and dramatic sequence in which young josh gets his first taste of battle , which perkins performs with heartbreaking realism . i recall my father , a world war ii veteran , saying that this scene was the most realistic depiction of a young man 's first time in battle that he had ever seen in the movies . when it is all over and the birdwells return to their quiet , hard-working , loving life as a family , the music ( dimitri tiomkin 's marvelous score ) swells , the wonderful lyrics to the song `` friendly persuasion '' are sung sweetly by the young pat boone , and you realize you have spent two wonderful hours with these genuinely fine , completely human characters in ordinary life and in challenging times . the story has been told with integrity , honesty , humanity , gentle humor , kind restraint and , yes , love -- all of these also attributes of the birdwell family that we have come to know . that is the `` genius '' of this film . along with a very few others , it shows us who we are , who we can be , and how we can live , all with a grace and humility that is almost poetic . and the film never , ever loses its balance . it 's just a great and good movie . i 've seen it almost a dozen times , and it can still move me to tears . i 'm betting it could be released today , amid the ridiculously over-budgeted , badly executed films that rely too much on computer effects and star charisma , and that it would clean up at the box office . the term `` family values '' has been kicked around a lot lately , and nobody quite seems to know what is really meant by it . watch this truly beautiful film and you 'll get a pretty good idea of the genuine meaning of those words .
1	this is another superbly done documentary from the award winning pbs investigative journalism series frontline ( peabody award , emmy and many more ! ) . disregard what one reviewer said about this being pro-walmart propaganda paid for by the corporation . he 's obviously smoking something , because this is made and hosted by hedrick smith , a pulitzer prize winning journalist who used to write for the ny times . he is one of america 's most respected journalists . i started watching the show since i was in high school ( i 'm now late 20 's ) and their shows are exceptionally high quality . now , if frontline is interviewing people who lost jobs and showing rubbermaid factory equipment being auctioned off because they got put out of business by walmart , how is this pro-walmart ? the story starts in america and its impact on the us economy . he interviews some professors , economists , managers , suppliers , and executives . then the story moves to china and hk , and then back to the us . there are some very clear insights from nmost of the people interviewed especially from one professor who talks about the shift in american culture and business history . is walmart good for america ? i ca n't answer that and neither can frontline . this documentary does an excellent job presenting facts without judgement and presents both sides and the complex shades in the middle . it asks some thought provoking questions . the us trade deficit is getting worse every day . quality is going up ( some `` made in china '' stuff is now very good and getting exponentially better every year ) , and that 's really scary for us in america . who 's the blame ? well , all of us . we 're not competing well in the global economy , and we want the cheapest goods . we 're not willing to put our money where our mouth is . if you 're interested in economics , history , social issues , this is a must see . if you care about the american economy , and global events , you should watch this documentary . it 's loads better than the `` walmart , the high cost of low prices '' film ( which is very one sided and not nearly as well done ) . oh , .. and start learning chinese
1	... that you simply have to see , `` mrs miniver '' being one , a little known film dealing with a fictitious german invasion to a sweet english village , `` went the day well ? '' and this film . why so ? because all 3 were made at the start of the war ( early 40 's ) when england stood very much alone in the fight agaisnt hitler and aggresive facism . invasion fears were rife , the war effort looked hopeless at times as in europe , hitler opposing country after country fell to the german aggressors ( not to mention the rampage going on in africa at the hands of rommel aided by the italian forces under mussolini 's instruction ) . england 's small island identity stood alone and under threat and was bombed , starved and demoralised into feeling invasion could happen any day . it was quite possibly the darkest of times in english history and these three films capture the flavour of that dispondancy but equally the might of the will to survive and protect , with realistic perfection . in which we serve does this more personally as we know it is based in truth and the characters become dear and well rounded quite quickly , inspiring us to care about these folk from many walks of british life . for a modern audience it may seem a little over stoic and sentimental at times but place the emotion in context of the year it was made ( 1942 ) , and i guarantee you will view it an aching sense of fear and hope which was precisely coward 's plan . an absolute gem and a must see , i weep every time i watch it
1	many , many years ago when i was a very young woman , i saw my first carry on movie and went to see every one i could possibly get to . then , there were none . several years ago , my sister taped a copy of carry on cleo for me . i could n't believe i still roared at the silliness only the brits can successfully pull off . it must have been fate that led me to look up `` carry on '' on amazon a few months ago . my heart skipped a beat when the carry on collection came up . i instantly made it mine and have watched most movies several times . my personal favorites : carry on constable , carry on cowboy , and carry on cabby . but they are all good . i 've loaned several movies to a brit here in the office who has seen all 27-something of the carry on series and who is now introducing them to his american family . they love them , too . if you love double-entendre done to perfection , do n't miss this collection
1	having drooled over the goodtimes dvd for years now , i did a flip and a half when i saw universal was releasing a widescreen dvd of this superhot love story . i refrained from doing two flips when i remembered it was universal and then saw no mention of special features . what ? look at the potential for bonuses ! there was an alternate ending , there were deleted scenes , how about a featurette ? ! argh ! i just wept and wept . and then months later the release date comes , i tear the dvd open and the movie starts automatically - i hit menu and get the nagging old `` operation prohibited by disc '' usually reserved for fast forwarding through those tired old fbi warnings . there 's not even a menu ! no scene selection . geez . do these corporate monoliths now require movies to be no older than 5 days old to have simple menus ? i 'd like to sit down and analyze the brilliance of sarandon and spader , note how spader 's hair changes near the end because of reshoots , but i 'm just too raving mad at universal right now .

0	i hate lawyers . what is a lawyer , anyway ? basically : it 's a telemarketer in a decent suit , a guy who would be hawking the latest ronco hair-in-a-can super-duper late night special to folks in akron over his plantronic headset , only he won the genetic lottery and got shot out of an upper-middle class womb . shakespeare said it first and best : `` first , let 's kill all the lawyers ! '' . former enron uber-dealmaker john wing put a little fast-times houston spin on that one : `` get all the lawyers in a room -- -and shoot 'em ! -- -in the mouth , so you *can't* miss ! '' exactly . anyway , `` the firm '' is a flick that purports to make the world of high-priced yappers jaw-rippingly exciting , so i was probably all amped up to despise it . but not really : back before i dug into a gig with the dark side in high finance , back when i was hefting a backpack over the sodden campus of my old alma mater , i briefly considered going into law : briefly , for about an hour . it was a desperate time , and i needed money . why did i consider walking hell 's highway , if only for an instant ? because john grisham , boring lawyer-turned-ripping-potboiler-writer-turned-back-into-boring-lawyer , a kind of tom clancy for the paper-pusher and green-eyeshade set , made it all sound pretty damned funky ( and lucrative ! hey , dig that bmw 7 series , baby , beep beep ! ) in his engrossing little novel `` the firm '' : granted , i 've read better prose on the backs of cereal boxes , but it held my attention . i mean , seriously : you 're 19 , and the whole flying out on the corporate lear to grand cayman and switching out briefcases full of cash sounds kinda cool . and strippers , man , plenty of strippers . oh , and did someone mention a bmw ? what 's the difference between a lawyer and a snake ? the snake at least has the decency to hiss before it sinks its fangs into your a** . now it 's true : grisham writes like kim jong il sings , but -- -in `` the firm '' , anyway -- -he was a master craftsman at moving things along at a bristling pace , from the pedestrian -- -hotshot law school whiz kid gets picked up by a memphis white-shoe law firm -- -to the pretty damned atrocious , all while keeping the pressure ratcheted up with a dense , suffocating sense of malice . grisham , like michael crichton , is n't a prose genius : he 's not even mediocre . but he writes for film , and `` the firm '' cried out for cinematic treatment . so it 's baffling that , with all the right stuff -- -tom cruise as winsome lead mitch mcdeere , gene hackman doing his chain-drinking gene hackman thang as the corrupt ( but ultimately worn-out and pathetic ) senior partner , and sydney pollack helming it up -- -that the big-screen treatment of `` the firm '' is such a yawner . talk about contempt of court . pollack takes all that intricately woven little grisham-plot and barfs big ugly chunks of it up on the screen . at its guts , really , `` the firm '' was really nothing more than the big career nightmare : i 've bet the farm on this gig , i 'm getting big money , i 'm working like a fiend , my wife is having trouble remembering my name , and evidently i 'm not doing tax-deals for loaded clients -- -i 'm doing money laundering for the mob . pollack just mangles the whole thing , convolutes the simple , and renders up a flick that will have you checking your watch and yawning . casting is part of the problem : cruise does his thing , running around memphis with his briefcase . hackman drinks a lot and exudes pure armani-clad sleaze : `` the firm '' is all funny-wrinkles when he 's onscreen , but hey , a man can only do so much . jeanne tripplehorn ( cruise 's squeeze ) , who plays lara san giacomo when she 's not playing tripplehorn ( seriously , google the two of 'em : astounding ! ) is a bitter old battleaxe who made me want to stick forks in my eyes . wilford brimley is just plain wrong as the firm 's security chief : too bald , too cracker , too rotund , too silly , too low-end , to do the role justice . holly hunter is even worse : hunter is one of those eighties thangs who got pumped up as something sexy , which is baffling , given that she 's about 3'8 , and has all the sex appeal of an oompah-loompah . it does n't help that she 's a big , ugly southern stereotype , the caricature most denizens of dumpy michigan towns imagine southerners to be . you want her to die : she does n't . pollack wants us to think she 's clever and funny . she is n't . ed harris , i think , is in this movie . so is hal holbrook , which kinda ruins everything , because everytime hal holbrook is in a movie you know you 're dealing with a bunch of friggin ' crooks . anyway , the coup de grace to the stupidity is the entrance , deus ex machina , of paul sorvino ( don morolto -- -what kind of goombah name is dat , anyway ? somebody call tony soprano ! ) , who takes this juggernaut of boredom from the merely stupid to the totally ridiculous . if you wan na see tom cruise running around memphis with his briefcase for two hours , by all means belly up to the bar . otherwise , case dismissed . js
0	just rented this dvd and was quite surprised . normally , i 'm a big george clooney and matt damon fan . however , in this film , their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script , editing , and direction which made this film quite dull to watch . while the idea behind the movie is good , it could have been more entertaing , dramatic , or suspensful . as another reviewer remarked , i was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else . but , i did suffer through to the end , where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging..

1	it gets laughs in its comicness in certain scenes it gets shocks like the beginning war scenes and the fight scenes it gets more interesting as the plot unravels great actors picked for such roles the perfect killing machines one insane in the brain and one out to save lives that should n't be lost in the first place the diner scene where the soldier orders alot of food and keeps eating and the guy says how you gon na pay for this and the soldier says `` i just want to eat , i do n't wan na hurt you , then he kicks ass while still enjoying his meal . and his reporter female friend comes in and says `` good meal '' as a question that is . and he says without words `` makes a happy sigh '' that 's hilarious . and how she looks around and see everyone who got their ass kicked from keeping him from eating his food priceless movie worth the watch again and again i 'm glad i saw this on tv when i was younger and i 'm glad i got this on dv

0	... but the movie was just plain stupid . do n't waste your time
0	well , i just got done watching this movie and actually went out of my way to write this review . truthfully , i did n't catch the last 20 or so minutes because i found myself doing other things around the house and could care less about what happend . the trailers and the dvd cover of this movie is very misleading . one would think that they are going to see something from a great genre of horror movies about zombies and a group of people doing whatever it takes to survive . i 'm a big fan of romero movies and loved 28 days later so i thought this movie would be a cool australian take-off . i could n't be more wrong . nothing in the movie makes sense from the start . the entire movie is over the top starting with the actors . everybody has entirely too much dialogue except for the main character who hardly says two words during the entire movie . she looks lost , confused , and out of her league . other characters include a local pilot and his pregnant girlfriend , a `` wacky '' police sgt with his asthmatic partner , the bait tackle clerk who never screams during the entire movie , and our heroin character who won the local beauty contest . the movie takes place in a small town in austrialia somewhere . when meteors strike the earth ( and slam into people ) , it unleashes a germ which causes people to become zombies . our main characters all meet up and try to survive . however , aliens are involved so the story goes from a survival story to beams of light dressed in capes and floating around right in the middle of a big battle . the viewer is left to wonder what 's going on at first , but as the dialogue and story become unbearably bad , you find yourself not caring as the minutes tick by . i honestly could n't tell you much else because it 's just so terrible that i just simply could n't take a minute more . bad acting , bad dialogue , over the top effects , and some of the worst camera work i 've ever seen . this movie apparently took two years to make ... imagine if they only had one ? ? ? another portion of this movie that makes me ill is the bait tackle charater . he shows up out of nowhere and saves the heroin 's life like a bad clint eastwood impression ( with big hat covering his eyes to boot ) . then , he walks away . when he appears again , he 's able to do these matrix style backflips ( digging his `` spurs '' into the wall/ceiling ) and making two pistols jump over his back and land directly into his hands . does this guy ever miss ? what do you think ? he manages to kill about 50 zombies with his two pistols while hanging from the wall upside down . not bad for a bait and tackle salesman living in the backwoods of australia ! if you dig the gore , this one is ok ... but again , wayyyy over the top . i had no idea that one bullet from a .45 could blow someone in half . our characters are so clueless that it actually takes them 3/4 of the movie to figure out how to shoot them in the head . i personally counted several scenes where a character is shooting a police revolver and somehow manages to get 13 shots out of a 6 shooter . someone get nasa on the phone and explain how you can do that because i just do n't get it . the absolutely worst part of this movie , without a doubt , is the music . it never stops ! there 's never a scene without music for some reason ! and it just makes what you 're watching seem absolutely cheesy ! it reminded me of a 1950 's serial/pirate swashbuckling kind of thing with guys swinging on ropes and jumping across a gorge kind of thing . the soundtrack is truly the worst i 've ever heard with extra cheese included . did they use up their budget on the effects ? probably ! i found myself wishing that i could mute the music during the film ! if you 're a fan of good monster / zombie movies , i beg you to pass this one by and keep on moving . it does n't make sense , the story is amazingly weak , the plot is ... well , there is n't one ... you 'll wish you could have your 2 hours back . i know i do ! ! !
1	the quality was good and the stories were also good . i am on the list when the first season comes out . this is like a tease
0	this movie creeped me out and not in a good way . johnny depp is an awesome actor and i usually find him sexy but in this stinker i find him really creepy and gross . maybe it 's the michael jackson-ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face . could they have picked a more horrible look for ww ? it looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10 $ wig and 5 $ clown makup on him ! i love tim burton 's other movies but this one sucked bigtime ! it gives a new perspective on willy wonka but this willy is someone i would keep kids away from . this movie is childish if you 're an adult and pales compared to the original . if you 're a kid it 's way too dark and scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking `` auntie zoe , what does that mean ? '' when are screenwriters going to figure it out ? either write a kids movie or write a grownup movie ! ! ! it 's really hard to do both in the same film . it seems like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and kids , they end up appealing to nobody ! maybe i am biased because i loved the original gene wilder version . i would have been open to seeing a remake if it was good but this movie was dissapointing . it 's amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is hollow with lousy characters . the whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones . the only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because i love depp and burton , if you are not a fan of either , do n't waste your time with this steaming pile of poo !
0	this film is among the worst , most pointless , and most inane garbage that i 've ever had the misfortune to view . contrary to popular belief the alien was not cute he was creepy ! the little boy was extremely annoying , and his relationship with the alien made me ill ! actually it made me more than ill , it was down right disturbing ! his bond with the alien was one of the most freeky thing i have ever had to witness , and the kids family was just obnoixious . by the time the alien go home no one really cares anymore . you are just relieved that the film is finally over . watch it only to say that you 've seen this .
0	one of the worst van damme movies of all time , this one and derailed and replicant and knock off , come of van damme baby , make good ones and have good directors too . this one has van damme after mickey rourke who rourke ends up killing him or he thinks he killed him , then van damme goes to an island of lost dead agents and villians ( corny ) . he escapes retardedly and then goes back to save his wife and his up and coming child ( who van damme and rodman almost indanger the poor kid , bastards ) . van damme gets help from puke and choke rodman and they have awesome adventures and eat lots of candy , no wait , thats what i was thinking and then , no . but there 's some , i said some , good action , but then it dies and sits there . the end with an oiled up shirtless rourke and the tiger lets the suspense and action down . strickly for fans of the movies van damme was crappy in . this is repuked up snot on a seseame seed bu
1	in america is a near perfect movie dealing w/ grief and learning to live again after tragedy . it is also about hope . the characters are engaging and each one is dealing with grief in their own way . they are all trying to find a new life literally in amerca and figuratively w/ in themselves after a variety of tragedies and set backs . the only real downside i can note on this movie is that i would have liked a little more back ground on frankie and mateo but i think the movie tries hard to put you in the midst of these lives without arbitrary flashbacks . besides , a great story the cinematograpy is well suited with its combination of views through a child 's camcorder and closer scenes of the city and family life . i especially liked ths subtle way the camera shows the changing of seasons . if you want to enjoy a good story and a bit of tear jerker thent his is a must see . if for nothing else than the performances of `` mateo '' and young `` kristie . '' just amazing .

0	i wo n't go into the movie itself , as other reviewers have done a more than adequate job of that . suffice to say that i have always enjoyed `` cloak dagger , '' despite the hokiness of some of the scenes ( not to mention the laughable visuals at the end ) . this movie still rates at least 4 stars from me . however , amazon reviews are supposed to cover the entire product , and not just the movie itself . in two words : it stinks . no trailer . no subtitles . no scene selections . no extras of any kind . not even a menu . when you slide the disc in , the movie starts right up . when the movie finishes , it starts over again . if you press the `` menu '' button on your remote , nothing happens . personally , i 'd prefer it if after the movie finished , playback would stop and you 'd go to a scene selection menu . even a still image telling you the movie was over would be better than playback looping back forever . i suppose i should be glad universal even bothered to release this movie on dvd . it 's just disappointing that they obviously did n't put any thought or effort into it
1	dmx stars as the drug dealer king david , who pops up in the streets again after a long absence . rolling into the frame in a player 's classic - a late 70 's stutz blackhawk - king david shrugs his way back into the hard-knock life . he quickly reaps what he sows and , mortally wounded , passes all his worldly goods to paul ( david arquette ) , a scrambling white would-be writer . king david 's estate includes an audio journal of his life , which provides flashbacks and a narrative-within-a-narrative that answers the shaken paul 's curiosity . it 's the highlights of king david 's high life that propel `` alone . '' like all of goines 's heroes , king david is a scourge on the periphery , and the movie dramatizes his corrosive effect on the margins with savvy muscularity . every life he touches he leaves in ruins - a need to deface beauty as a result of self-loathing is implicit , and dmx signals that motivation with sly hostility . to say that king david is the best part he 's ever had is an understatement ; he has never felt the need to inhabit a movie in this way before . i would recomed this to anyone who likes the hip hop lifestyle or music and for anyone who like films with a twist
1	based on the bestselling novels by michael and jeff shaara , `` gods and generals '' and `` gettysburg '' ( based on the elder shaara 's `` the killer angels '' ) are the most excting and emotional civil war epics ever filmed . the battle scenes are the most exciting and realistic civil war battle sequences ever put on screen . the acting is phenomenal , with the likes of jeff daniels , stephen lang , tom berenger , robert duvall , bruce boxleitner , martin sheen , richard jordan , sam elliott and mira sorvino , but to name a few of the fine actors and actresses in these two movies . director ronald f. maxwell has created a masterpiece with his first two films , giving rise to the hope that the last film , `` the last full measure , '' will complete what will hopefully be the best civil war trilogy ever made ! `` gods and generals '' movie/dvd grade : a+ `` gettysburg '' movie/dvd grade : a+ overall grade : a+
1	it is almost ashame that north amercian culture needs bill maher . after all , should n't honest yet entertaining social commentary be a little bit more available then it currently is ? on victory begins at home , maher creates entertainment by basically speaking his mind . maher 's central premise that the war on terrorism can be aided by what people do in the united states really is almost a common sense arguement . yet maher is so uniquely unapologetic about what he says and how he presents it , the commentary and comedy bristle with an energy that few comedians can match . maher does this by not pretending he is n't politically opinated , in fact that is what bases his comedy completely on , the rarity of straight-forward unabashed opinion . on victory begins at home he is more democrat then republican , but he openly sides with neither . instead , he rails at all presenting himself as a full person , neither liberal nor conservative , right-wing or left-wing . the end result is an engaging and unique look at culture that seems unfiltered . there is no spin here , what maher realizes is that no spin is funny in a world full of it . with all the spin that is normally doled out by the news media , political columnists and special interest groups , know wonder we need him so much .
1	do n't discount this film because you are dismayed by tom cruise . this film is excellent and a must see . the symbolism in this film alone makes it worth a look . attempt to ignore good old tom and rekindle your love for him pre-insanity . kubrick rarely gets enough accolades for this movie , as he should
1	my kids really did learn a lot from this movie , i would recommend it when your child is trying to learn to go on the potty
0	the `` fake-news '' tv movie had already be done , and done better , ten years ealier as `` special bulletin '' . where the first movie took its subject , nuclear disarmament and terrorism , seriously , this cheese-fest does n't respect the viewers ' intelligence at all . they pull every heartstring and throw every cheap trick they can think of at the camera . not of it ties together in any coherent way and the `` make love not war '' ending reeks of junior-high-school sophistry
1	it 's just like the hit tv show ! in fact they probably got the idea for the tv show from this movie . actually i thought it was more of a comedy than anything . i saw it on the `` we '' network . it 's worth the price if you feel like buying it .
1	as promised , this product was sent brand new and arrived quicker than expected . my brother loves soccer and thoroughly enjoyed this as a present for christmas
1	dvd # 1 presents a terrific hour-long history of the franchise . it hits both the high- and lowpoints , and indicates why the packers are a national treasure and probably the greatest team in nfl history . lambeau , hutson , lombardi , starr , nitschke , the ice bowl , favre , white , the nine nfl championships , the three super bowls they won ( i , ii , and xxxi ) , and the one they lost ( xxxii ) . the best fans in the league , the smallest venue , the most legendary stadium , and the team 's miraculous survival over 80+ years , in no small part because they are the only pro team in any sport that is entirely owned by their fans . the highpoint , of course , is the 15-minute section entitled `` lombardi '' which encapsulates the green bay career of the nfl 's greatest coach -- but at the end of this dvd about the packers ' heroic ongoing history , you realize that as great as lombardi was , the team is greater still . dvd # 2 was produced earlier in vhs format ( i bought it at the packer pro shop in gb ) and portrays the greatest game in packers history and one of the greatest in nfl history . other reviewers have justly praised its play-by-play reconstruction and modern-day interviews with the participants . yes , kramer was offside -- but luck is a part of any game , and the cowboys had a generous helping of it in the second quarter . like another reviewer , i love the postgame interviews , even the glimpses of green bay in 1967 . the muted colors of the frigid game ( maybe packer jerseys actually were that dark in the 60s -- i see the same thing in footage of other games ) and the elegaic tone of the final interviews give a haunting sense of a world that is now departed .
0	i bought this for the jeffrey dahmer and john wayne gacy documentaries , like i imagine you might . i 'm not disappointed really , i do n't regret buying it in any sense , it 's just that this dvd is n't very good at all . it does n't attempt to make any insight , which is n't something i particularly care for anyway . what each documentary offers is a limited and quite dated view of the serial killers . i ca n't imagine anyone learning something they did n't already know from them . it 's mostly told through pictures when it seems there 's option to use video . the dahmer documentary , made in 1993 , does n't feature anything of interest . there 's no interview with his father or anything , just a voice telling a story over pictures we 've all seen before , with occassional clips of victims ' families in court . the gacy one , made in '96 , is the same . there 's also a program , made in 1997 , on criminal profiling . this look at three farely well known killers whose capture supports profiling . it 's told often with video rather then photos , which is good , but still they 're somewhat boring subjects . the criminal profiler , dahmer , and gacy are all episodes from the a & amp ; e series investigative reports , if you did n't realise . the last program is on charles manson . it 's quite different from the others on the disc . made in 1997 , it originally aired on television as biography : charles manson : journey into evil . i do n't with have any interest in manson , but i guess it 's ok . it features significant interviews with manson and main female members of the family . all programs run for about one hour or more . i would n't reccomend any of them , none are good at all . i might even describe them as terrible , considering what else is out there
1	this disc is pure gold ! featuring a full live performance from their 2004 european tour and tons of classic and backstage footage this is the ultimate stray cats fan collectible ! the concert documented on this disc is so satisfying you would think it was still the early 80 's . they show almost no signs of age and you can tell they pour their heart out into the show . they go through all their classics and then some . whether it 's `` stray cat strut '' `` gene and eddie '' or `` rumble in brighton '' what you see and hear on this disc is flawless . must buy for all music fans , not just fans of the cats
1	i am a dancer . i found the choreography in this movie beautiful , brillient and different . the emotion in it really touched me , and i had actually fallen out of dancing because of many different reasons and this movie really did bring me back to my love of dance . it 's very rare to find dance movie that will offer quite as much as this movie did . not to mention i absolutly adore george de la pena . awsome dancer and he was my favorite character in the movie . i love the fact that every character has something they are working through , no one is exactly perfect . to me , although the acting may not be what every one would call oscar quality , to me , it shows a glimps in to life . how pent up emotions can lead to frustrations that are some times difficult to get through . this movie , to me is well worth the watch . sorry for the ramble .
1	warner herzog 's `` grizzly man '' won the director 's guild award for best feature documentary , but the people who pass out oscars apparently did n't agree . `` grizzly man '' was not among this year 's nominees for best documentary . many of herzog 's narrative films , such as `` fitzcaraldo , '' deal with man 's attempt to challenge the indifference of nature , so `` grizzly man '' is not a departure by any means . herzog 's heroes are often obsessed with accomplishing some mysterious , even bizarre , goal . timothy treadwell 's fixation is on grizzly bears . `` i am one of them , '' he is heard to say . he survived in the wild , accompanied by a video camera , and , on at least one occasion , by a girlfriend. , living among the most dangerous beasts in the world whom he apparently believed he was protecting . `` animals rule , '' he said , fist defiantly pumping in the air . `` timothy conquered . '' treadwell became a minor celebrity during his life , appearing once on david letterman 's cbs show , but he aspired to more . before letting his love of animals consume him , he tried his luck in hollywood . he got an agent , and auditioned for tv and movie roles . he was , he told his parents , second choice for the bartender role on `` cheers '' which went to woody harrelson . missing out on that opportunity left him `` crushed . '' what really drove treadwell ? he reminds me of fey little carson on `` queer eye for the straight guy , '' and as he openly mentions that it 's easier to be gay than straight , i wonder if he was homosexual but unable to deal with his orientation , transferred his love of men to the roughest trade imaginable : grizzly bears . `` i like girls , '' he volunteers , but then he mentions various cruising places - truck stops , men 's rooms - in such a way as to make me think he had personal experience haunting these kinds of homosexual hangouts . he was also an alcoholic . were his wilderness adventures an escape from passions he was emotionally and psychologically unprepared to pursue ? those who are seen offering their remembrances of treadwell never allude to his sexuality . they describe a man whose life is ruled by a naive , hippy , new age approach to nature and who died as a result . the bears , to whom he gave names like `` mr. chocolate '' and `` tabitha , '' need protection , he said , and he was their self-appointed caretaker . others suggest that , despite his good intentions , he did more harm to the animals than he could have imagined . after treadwell was eaten by a bear , the animal was shot and its remains became a feast for other forms of wildlife . shooting a bear because he eats a man is comparable to shooting the customers at kfc for eating chicken . what is a bear supposed to do with a human who invades his turf ? treadwell was an intruder . one mans saystreadwell made the mistake of thinking these were people in bear suits . but treadwll knew these were animals . trouble is , his knowledge of animals seemed to have been learned from disney cartoons . the universe , director herzog says , is ruled by hostility , chaos , and murder . treadwell had a different philosophy . `` is n't that sad ? '' he squeals in his high-pitched girlish voice as he observes a bee who apparently expired while doing `` his pollen thing . '' `` i love that bee , '' he says . partially financed by the discovery channel , `` grizzly man '' is superficially a nature documentary about a man who loved wildlife so much that he felt at home among the bears and wolves more than he did his fellow humans . but it 's also a portrait of a highly disturbed man who admits he was treated for manic depression but rejected medication to control the condition because , he admitted , he needed those soaring highs and crushing lows . he also needed to record his solitary life on video . we see him crying as he pets a wolf , laughing when his command that god make it rain seems to have been obeyed , and arrogantly blasting the humans whom he perceives as the enemy of the animals . what we do not see is his final encounter with the bear that ate him . mercifully , the lens cap was on the camera when he was attacked . the camera was running , though , and treadwell 's screams , and the screams of his girlfriend , were recorded . out of respect for his family , herzog does not let the audience hear these recordings . instead , we see him listening to the audio , and his reaction ( telling one of treadwell 's friends that she must never listen to it , just as she must never see the coroner 's photos of the aftermath of the attack ) , is possibly more effective than including the obviously horrific sounds in the film . `` i had no life , '' treadwell said of his days before he began to frolic with ferocious beasts . `` now i have a life . '' that life is memorialized in herzog 's film . brian w. fairbank
0	dont take me wrong i do love mariah but this movie is not making any sense to me i mean mariah doesnt seem very interest to `` play '' in this movie ! ! ! this movie is all about music music music music music repeating over and over again nothing new nothing has been changed ... come on ! ! ! but then mariah seem to be better in another movie called wisegirls but again i honestly dont think that mariah should be an actress herself i mean i think she is better off to be a singer instead of playing movies . wisegirls she seem like she wanted to have the `` attention '' and `` show-off '' like saying in her mind : `` look at me i am in the movie ! '' i honestly deep in my heart she dont need to be playing in any movies unless she stands up and do her `` work '' with her actions in the movies not like this and wisegirls movies . i feel bad for giving this movie a 1 star but i had to say what 's my opinion about this movie anyways . wisegirls was alittle better than this one !
0	in this film made in uk and luxembourg , madeline stowe stars as senga . senga and her daughter nat are driving at midnight after visiting nat 's father . they bicker the whole trip and it just increases when they stop for a break at a rest stop . nat runs away with a mysterious girl who tries and recruits her into a mysterious cult . and we are left with a nerve wracked mother doing all she hectically can to retrieve her daughter . both the daughter and mother eventually learn that this cult kills people for their blood . why they do so is never explained . and even at this point when senga is trying to rescue nat , she still acts like a brat . the last third of the movie seems to just generate more confusion . and becomes unbelievable and my main reason for the rating i assigned . that good part of the movie has to be attributed to the direction , not the wirtting . the movie is dark and suspenseful . though you do not know what really is transpiring in this movie , it does keep you on the edge of the seat as senga tries to rescue her daughter
0	running with scissors is a slice of life movie which spends time leering into the lives of eccentrics and then ends with no revelations or culminating event . unfortunately what comes before the movie fails to culminate is not very profound or insightful . it is marginally entertaining and somewhat troubling . the lead character in the movie is a 15-year old . his parents divorce , and his selfish mother sends him to live with her charlatan psychoanalyst and his similarly-acquired family . lead is on course to become a writer ( who eventually writes the non-fiction account upon which this movie is based ) , but we see little of his efforts to develop himself as a writer . all the performances were serviceable , save for gwyneth paltrow , who lazily regurgitates a role she played previously . annette benning is also essentially revisiting a role she played in a better movie . mrs. benning performed excellently and selflessly , but the similarity of the roles intruded on my view of the movie . it is a sure sign that hollywood is producing too many dysfunctional family flicks when all actors have been consigned to act in them and some actors are serving a second term . also growing tiresome is the treatment of gays in movies . the presence of one or more characters has become a requirement in films that explore a set of quirky characters . furthermore , the gays are stereotypically endowed with greater passion and depth of emotion , and are put-upon or stifled by the stodgy straights . the most promising characters are the psychoanalyst 's wife and adopted daughter . the movie has some colorful and funny scenes , but these are not enough to justify a viewing
0	the so-called humor in this embarrassingly awful and unfunny movie is so uncreative and moronic . it is apparently for a demographic of viewers with an extremely childish sense of humor . a three year old will laugh at anything . every turn of the plot is stupid . this is in the running for the worst movie ever made . i do n't trust the taste of anyone who actually was impressed by this horse manure . i hope that bruce willis would have the class to turn down a role like this if he was offered it now . i think he is a very good actor . it 's a shame what kind of garbage he had to be in , to get his career going
0	the first time i put this workout dvd on , i expected to see exercises designed for abs , buns and thighs . what i actually saw was an easier version of the kickboxing dvd . i kept going , thinking it would get to the abs , buns and thighs , but it never did ! the other huge problem with this video is that half of it is filmed from the waist up , or headshots only , so when you are being introduced to a new step in the routine , you ca n't even learn it , because you can not see the instructors legs or feet . also very irritating how there are interruptions in filming , picking up on a different beat to where it left off . all in all an awful purchase and not even worth the $ 4.86 paid . i turned it off halfway through the second workout and put billy blanks taebo on instead . much better ! ! !
0	when i 1st watched requiem from the darkness i had high hopes for an anime show i heard that could actually by scary . to my dissappointment this show was not scary at all but a mockery of anything that is anime . this show has good animation is some spots with some deformed shapes of people . the strengths of the show however primarily rely on its soundtrack which is above average but nothing amazing . also the last straw with this show was the horrible depictions of people being graphically murdered . this show is disgusting because of these potrayals a brothers murdering each/husband killing wife after wife/a man who enjoys murder/and very very intense sexual situations of insects and once again family members murdering each other . i recommend this show to no one and i believe geneon has made a mistake licensing it . if you do n't heed my review then you have wasted your money on a dvd not worth a penny ( i would n't take it for free )
1	i loved this dvd set ! grew up watching it..and remember running home after school to catch each days episodes . watching this set transported me back to another time , when things were peaceful and less frazzeled ! stayed up till 2 am watching it all and felt like that little kid from school again ! like many young girls back then i was 'in love ' with tim considine ! so nice to see he and david back talking about it ! i hope disney co. will put out the next 2 series of this great show on dvd soon
1	i worried that the 80s soundtrack would detract from the film 's power as a period piece , but it totally did n't . it was seamless . i will buy this for my home collection . i have always loved kirsten dundst 's work and this is no exception
1	i feel some of the other reviews here are unjust and over exagerated . there were two places in the film that in total lasted maybe about five minutes where the sound was distorted , but not badly since you could still understand the characters clearly ( ex . one area had a warpy vhs noise and the second had a bit of low static ) . the costumes were well selected , but i felt a better job could have been done on the rats and the lizard ( you can see a gap where the costume ends on his face ) . this version follows the book well , though it left out a favorite qoute about the taste of the liquid in the first scene that she drinks from the `` drink me '' bottle . i also felt that the british accents in the movie enhanced the film . i recomend this to fans and people who are n't overly critical of films
1	daniel deronda is george eliot 's 1876 novel dealing with the rise of zionism incarnated in young daniel deronda . sadly but truly this is the first major english novel giving a positive view of the jewish people . deronda is raised by the wealthy sir malinger as an english gentleman . in the course of the long novel and miniseries he learns he is a jew ; meets his mother and is the love object of two fascinating women . mirah lapidoth is the jewish musician who is rescued from suicide by daniel . her love for daniel burgeons as she comes to know and love the kind young man . gwendolyn harleth played by the brilliant acting of romola garai is the spoiled , impecunious husband hunter who weds the rich cad grandcourt only to rue her unwise choice of mates ! she loves deronda as her marriage becomes a torture chamber of psychological combat . like all bbc productions this one is photographed in beautifully rich colors . the scenery is beautiful and the musical score is haunting to the ear . this tale runs about four hours and is a joy.many american viewers may be dismayed at the slow , leisurely pace of british productions . please remember that these productions are based on long english novels which were published in several monthly parts . they are long but they are also wonderful explorations of the human soul . gwendolyn 's story is a bildungsroman in which she grows as a person . ditto for deronda who learns to take pride in his hebrew heritage . this is a worthy bbc production well worth the viewer 's time and money
1	maybe the most engaging documentary ever made . brilliant style is used in telling the story of one of the giants of the movie industry , producer robert evans . giving magical illumination and motion to still pictures in a way that i could only describe as psychedelic . being a film fanatic for the last 43 years i was shocked and ashamed to find that i had not heard of robert evans . in all my reading of credits over the years i had somehow missed his name . i had remembered seeing william castle 's name at the beginning of rosemary 's baby but not evan 's . then , at finding out that he was the driving force behind love story , the godfather , the godfather pt.2 , chinatown and one of my personal favorites the president 's analyst and that he was a big reason why those movies were so good , well i was just dumbfounded . and these are just a fraction of the films he 's produced . of course he did n't start as a producer . he had been in women 's apparel with his brother and accredited their endeavours as the reason why women wear pants today . while lounging around a pool one day he was discovered by norma shearer , lauching his career into show biz . it seems he knows everybody and i mean everybody . after watchng this extraordinary film i called my father to ask him if he had ever heard of this astonishing personality . i queried , `` have you ever heard of robert evans ? '' anxiously awaiting a `` no '' so i could tell him all about this amazing show biz entity . he replied , `` you mean bob evans . '' yes indeed , it seems he knows everybody . my father had come across him in his days as a buyer for macy 's . i asked , `` do you know what he does now ? '' `` he 's some sort of movie director or something now , is n't he . `` , dad answered . i bought him the audiobook . evans narrates both the documentary and the audiobook , both which are drawn from his autobiograghy by the same name . his voice is almost as amazing as his story and probably greatly enabled his prowess . he also lent his voice to the short-lived , hysterically irreverent cartoon series kid notorious that still airs on comedy central . all in all , whether you know evans or not this is a fascinating , beautifully made film about a producer whose achievements are arguably greater than thalberg 's and selznick 's combined . the story of his life and loves is the stuff of legends and it goes on and on . this is a must see for anyone interested in tinseltown . ps : i do n't usually care for the added features but these are worthwhile and the credits to the main part of the documentary are alone worth the price of the disc . what a hoot and more proof that he knows everybody . ask your dad . who knows ?
0	after two decades since watching upstairs downstairs , i rashly decided to buy the whole set ! ! ! ! as i watched the first episodes i realized my memory had played a scurvy trick on me ! the melodrama was a bit vulgar and very predictable ! later episodes of the set improved , but not by much ! it was like watching a biplane that did n't quite make it over the trees at the end of the runway . i hope you wo n't make the same mistake i did
0	i bought this movie for my husband because its one of his faves . when we received it we found out it was a blu ray edition and our dvd player does n't accept blu ray dvd 's . so i basically bought a movie i ca n't watch . it should have been put in the description that this a blu ray edition for those of us who do n't have blu ray compatible dvd players
0	a french saying goes : `` the more things change , the more they stay the same . '' it appears that the `` historical '' epic film of yesteryear is still much like that of today in that `` poetic '' license is taken to the extreme in passing outright lies and fabrications as truth . one of the things that really turned my stomach watching this is d w griffith 's emphasis at least twice during the film that he did not intend to offend any race but wanted to show historical events and yet goes on to portray outright falsehoods as truth . firstly , we all know that this cameron dude did not start the kkk and that this organisation has its roots in indiana and not south carolina . secondly , the kkk is not the defender of the south and there is no need to `` purify '' the race as is portrayed here the exact words used by d w is `` preserve the aryan race . '' modern science , using cutting edge dna research has already proved that we all come from the same african man about 60,000 years ago and so any racial distinctions are not only ethically wrong but factually wrong as well . like it or not , we are all related and separated only by about 2000 generations despite our seemingly outward physical differences and have a common ancestor . some of the portrayals of blacks as alcoholics and white women predators with behaviours more akin to monkeys i found extremely revolting and shocking and leaves me completely unsurprised that riots and lynchings quickly followed the screenings of this movie . yes , this movie may have been the first feature length movie that used a number of novel techniques but does this excuse the content ? this is not akin to an einstein discovering relativity folks ; every single `` good '' thing about this movie would have been `` discovered/invented '' with or without d w. eventually and very probably very soon after . every one of the techniques used would have eventually been used by any of the later , talented directors of the time . the overall lies , attempts to justify racism and the murderous kkk more than make this film fit for the dust bin than for immortality in movie 's great hall of fame . they say that racists are not born but bred ; this is why i 'm not at all surprised at what d w griffith has done here . his father was considered a `` hero '' of the confederate army where he served as a colonel . i 'm sure as a bitter loser of the great war , he must have taught his son his belief system and how to be a great racist . this movie has not been preserved all that well with many scenes being either too bright or too dark and the soundtrack is too loud and it 's quite irritating to have to keep hearing mendelssohn 's overtures over and over again . in conclusion , the question this movie raises is does freedom of expression mean it 's okay to make a mockery of history to further a racist directors ' world view ? also , do you buy the fact that just because this is the first movie that 's longer than an hour mean that this should be revered for all time despite its extremely offensive and destructive message ? like i said before none of the `` techniques '' that this film claims to have `` discovered '' are earth-shattering discoveries that would have required a genius to uncover anyway . so the bottom line is we have here an extremely racist and hate-inducing film that caused a lot more damage than good ; d w griffith 's legacy/mess
1	this is a good 1st season set for the series of criminal intent . i strongly recommend this if you are a fan
1	this box set is worth every penny ! this is an absolute must have if you meet the following eligibility requirements : 1 . you have a decent tv ( at least 32 '' ) and are able to watch in the dark 2 . you have surround/stereo sound 3 . you love 3d ! ! ! ! ! ! i bought this set a few years ago but unfortunately i made a big mistake . i bought the `` horror '' collection- which works- except that the movies are horrible and hard to watch . then a friend of mine turned me on to the three movies in this set recently ( encounter , alien adventure , haunted castle ) and i was simply blown away . now i can not stop watching these 3d movies ! ! the movies are all made by nwave pictures- and boy- have they done a fantastic job ! ! ! ! informative , fun , and of the highest quality ... ..this is the definitive 3d package . kids will love , and so will adults . also , once you have the lcd shutter glasses , they will work on any `` field sequential '' 3d movie you can get your hands on . these movies are thrilling though- especially the non-stop coaster rides in each one . do you hear what i am saying ? ? buy this ... ... now ! ! you can thank me later ! ! ! 100 stars if i could and of course..highly reccomended
0	sit down under a tree , give it a big hug , fire up you bong and go to sleep . that 's what i was waiting for freeman to do all movie . it 's a shame that special effects that were so ground breaking were waisted on this sci-fi hippie flick . i 'm surprised that freeman 's suit was n't tie-dyed . keep your money say no to drugs !
1	a dvd with a message that pulls at the heart , and presents sadness and then joy to the viewer . strong singing cast with excellent voices . a must see
0	quite possibly one of the worst movies of all time . clive owen is really cool , but not in this movie . angelina jolie 's polital agenda totally fueled this film . what a waste of time
0	`` incredible '' i saw one review describing this production . the meaning of the word must have been changed in the dictionary because this is not incredible . it is slow , convoluted and uninspired . no chemistry exists between the actresses , with no connection to the audience .
1	i used lexar media multi card reader in my p2120 fujitsu laptop via a usb 2 pc-card adapter . it 's truly plug-and-play without any need of drivers in windows xp
1	i received this product from an amazon.com seller for 1/2 the price of what best buy was selling it for . it was new and in an unopened box . upon opening the box i was able to tell right away that it was built very good . the hinges for the outer antenna sections are very sturdy and once locked in the open position were not going anywhere . i had spent over $ 300 for a runco antenna for my runco projector for local hd ( directv does not have local hd in my area ) and even with perfect mounting position outside was only getting at best 80 % reception with it . this antenna with a similar design the the runco model is built better and i get between 94-98 % reception depending on the channel ( directional antenna so reception varies slightly ) . i was also amazed with the fact that i not only get local channels for youngstown ohio , but i also get locals with over 60 % reception from cleveland ( direction antenna is facing ) but also pittsburgh ( which is on opposite side of house about 60 miles away and in opposite direction antenna is facing ) . great product and no issues with it so far . the included booster works better than the one built into my directv receiver , so i advise hooking antenna up straight to your ant in on the back of your projector ( if it has a built in hd tuner ) or tv for best results
0	i 've had this phone for approx . 9 months now , maybe longer ... and i truly do n't know how i 've stood using this dual phone system for so long . however , tonight i 've taken a giant step `` upward '' towards better quality and design with the panasonic kx-tg 5432m dual system . this dual handset is the worst i 've ever experienced in a cordless system . from the moment i set it up , the static has been atrocious . step away from the base unit over ten feet and it sounds like someone gargling gravel or a mad cat hissing in your ear . i ca n't even step into my attached garage to talk with someone without major static to the point of not even being able to be heard by the other person . even within six feet of the base i receive intermittent static that becomes obnoxious and distracting , not only to me , but to the other person on the other end ... for they hear it too . i will never purchase another uniden product , if this is the non-quality of product they put out . i had a 2.4 mhz system that would outshine this system ... and i wish i 'd never gotten rid of it . as the title says ... if you desire a lot of static when you talk on a phone , this is the system you need to bring that crackling symphony of music to your ear . the melodic consistancy this system creates in ones enjoyment of talking on the phone will not put you to sleep , but rather increase your aggravation of dealing with what sounds like a major electrical storm going on inside your head . uniden should be ashamed of this product . stepping down from the soapbox now..
1	i recently bought one of these for our 18-month-old son . the piano arrived in fine shape . the piano and bench are sturdy and well made when you put them together properly . the sound is just like i remember a toy piano should sound . notes are not perfectly in tune like a fine instrument , but tuned within reason to the notes of the scale , including sharps and flats . most importantly , our little boy just loves playing this piano . hopefully it will inspire him to continue and so it is as great an introdroduction to music as any other toy , including the electronic toys , we have purchased for him . i also liked that he was n't able to pull off the keys try as he may . they just kind of become locked when he trys to do that and can be put back in place by minor adjstment .
0	about three years ago , maybe four , i bought two lexar cfii cards . one never worked , the other worked , but lost all data . i wrote to lexar , that i had two bad cards , they sent me one new card of the same size . i gave that to my girlfriend told her to only use it on pix she did n't care about losing . i still have my card , in a ziplock . none of the file removal programs will get the images off , i 've used all of them , had their ( file removal ) tech help give up . in this day age of `` just make the item '' i am upset . but you take your chances . do you want the only picture of your great grand-mother lost because you used a lexar ? i would n't , i use an actual sandisk card , myself . if they ever ( lexar ) made it right , i may have written a better review , but they have n't . so that tells me that they do n't care . how important are your pictures to you ? frederic
1	i was about to retire an old standalone dvd recorder , because it would no longer let me create menus or finalize discs . i bought this lens cleaner and -- voila ! -- the recorder is working again . super easy to use ( it 's simply a dvd that you insert into your machine , and the menus tell you what to do ) . highly recommended
0	i think the most frustrating thing about a fax machine , is when you put your four or five page fax into the feeder , and the machine sucks two or three sheets at once ruining your whole fax ! i especially got this machine because i thought it was a quality machine , and would n't do that , but i was wrong . sometimes this machine sucks more than one sheet at a time which is very frustrating . i would stay away . it prints nicely , but it does n't help if it ruins your faxes . i see other reviewers have the same problem
0	i bought 2 of these drives to set up a raid1 array ( mirror ) and one of them continuously has errors , causing the array to be degraded . i called tech support and they said these drives do not support raid . big let down , i have to go for the server version which will end up costing much more
0	i was very disappointed in the lexmark p450 printer . the colors were very dull and the picture quality were definitely not up to the lexmark standards that i am used to . ( i have several lexmark products ) i returned the printer
1	what an amazing product for such a small price . it works right out of the box , but to get full functionality you need to install the encolsed drivers . the option of mouse or pen makes it useful for everyday pc work as well using the pen for graphics . i use it mainly for teaching via phone and use the whiteboard in messenger to communicate in words and pictures . it really makes a difference . the unit seems well made and i like the fact you can personalise the tablet to add a picture of your choice . i opted for the smallest in the range for value , and was not disappointed , but i am sure for more commerical use or for artwork a much bigger screen would be better , but at cost . the software bundle is ok too if you do n't already have photoshop tools . the one quibble is that at home when i installed the drivers it continued to crash my pc with my wireless keyboard installed . not ideal , but as i dont use it at home any longer it is not a problem for me , but be careful , i am sure there will be a fix somewher
0	everything works fine except for two flaws in excel : on the numpad , the minus key actually toggles shift and the slash key acts as the alt key . this is unacceptable , i had a logitech keyboard also with all sorts of annoying little flaws which surfaced when playing games . logitech has some great ideas and sleek looking products , but they are plagued with small yet crucial technical shortcomings . i will never buy logitech again
1	my dad and i installed it in just an hour ! it was very . you ca n't beat this price . i found the same mount at best buy for over $ 200 ! ! !
1	i 've had this device for two years . just today i sent it through the wash cycle of my laundry ( not on purpose ) . the thing still works ! ! i will not , however , try sending it into the dryer though beause i 'm pretty sure that would fry this thing
0	i ordered this on the recommendation of another amazon customer . i wasnt impressed . i though this would save me money because until then i had been just buying new copies of my favorite cds that were scrathced up . i cleaned a few discs and ran them through all three `` processes '' without successful results . it didnt seem to make much difference with any of my discs . i dont think this is a good `` repairer '' of any disc thats more than mildly scratched . my suggestion would be to just replace your damaged discs by buying another copy of your cd or dvd on amazon ! ! many of my cds i have replaced for $ 7-10 bucks on here . i wish i wouldve kept my $ 25
1	mouse is comfortable to use , and i have n't had any problems with it so far . i did have some difficulty hooking it up to my computer , but once i figured out the problem it was all smooth sailing from there . it is my first wireless mouse , so i have nothing else to compare it to , but i definitely like it a lot better than my old mouse .
1	this is the perfect little tv/dvd for a little girl 's room ! the picture is great and hello kitty pops on screen for certain commands ( volume , channel change.. ) . my daughter age 4 loves it . i would have given this product 5 stars but there are a couple drawbacks ... the remote control is has so many buttons and they are very tiny , very close together . i can barely read what each button does because the labels/print is also very tiny . this is annoying when in my daughter 's darkened room and i have to turn on a bright light just to find the pause button ... the other thing i have to point out that bugs me is that you ca n't eject/or open the dvd player unless the tv is in dvd mode . in other words when i go to put in a dvd , i ca n't just push `` open '' . nothing will happen . you have to find the right button , choose `` dvd '' from a choice of 3-4 things , and only then will the tray slide open . all in all , these things would not prevent me from buying this tv again ... although it would be nice if they did come out w/ a more kid friendly remote with bigger buttons/symbols for a small child to recognize ... one great thing i want to point out -- there is fast forward scan that you can watch as it fast forwards ( something not all dvd players offer ) and this is great when you are putting a dvd in for your child and they want to skip all those pre-movie ads ... .you can ff right to the beginning of the movie ! ! !
1	use canon ink with you canon printer and you 'll have no problems , just excellent pictures
1	excellent product - very ergonomic , easy to set up and use ! wireless works great . i would recommend this product
0	i purchased this product and could n't get it to work on a pc , laptop , or pda ( cingular 8125 ) . not only does it not register in any sd/minisd card reader , but the craftsmanship appears to be suspect as well . i am currently pursuing a refund
1	this was a great buy , item was as described . a++++++++++
0	hello , i purchased the avic-d2 , xm and the ipod kit from amazon . i then went to my local installer and confirmed with them that they could install all three devices and still allow my factory rear entertainment center to function in the new setup . after 3.5 hours they failed . i decided that i 'd return the items because i needed to get an alternative gift before christmas and i did n't have time to find another way to get it installed . i was able to return the d2 , but the gex-p10xmt and the ib100ii are not returnable . it turns out that amazon brokered my sale to three other companies that have differing return policies . had i realized that amazon would sell me something that i ca n't return i would have purchased elsewhere . at this point i will never purchase anything else from amazon ever again
0	i just bought these matte labels . when i printed a photo , i noticed that photos come out at the ultra lowest quality , and the worst part is that everything printed on these labels smudge when fingers are lightly run over the labels . has anyone experienced this ? please share your story
1	this is simply the best remote you will ever need for all your infarad remotes ! i have a chinese satallite receiver that i could never get it to work with all other `` universal '' remotes . i was able to teach this remote to work with it ! this is a small computer
1	bag is attractive and very sturdy . the computer fits securely and is well padded . i recently used it on a trip and was able to place other carry on items in it and it traveled well
0	the pros : -you can reposition the product as many times as you like to get the best fit without it losing it 's adhesive . -it allows you to use with any type of arm band or car dock because it fits so well . -does n't prohibit any functions of the ipod ( i.e . sensitivity of the wheel is just as good with the shield on ) the cons : -bubbles , bubbles , bubbles . i 've carefully applied and re-applied this product no less than 20 times in a variety of different ways , and it leaves numerous bubbles on the ipod everytime , especially on the screen . -if the screen is not lit up , all you can see is bubbles on the screen . -it does n't do the ipod justice , because it looks so cheap when applied . -after 2 days with this product i 'm already looking to replace it .
1	the best sound i 've ever heard in a radio . i also own a cambridge soundworks 730 and a bose wave cd/radio . despite the fact that this is a mono radio , its sound is incredible accurate , warm and powerful . the bass is astounding and the highs crystal clear . i agree with a report i 've read in cnet that states this is probably the best sounding radio ever made .
1	i purchased this item on march 15 from amazon . we 've been using it for almost a month now . my wife and i have built our ht system in our master bedroom ( 16x14x10 ) also have 40 '' samsung lcd 4095 ( 1080p ) and polk audio speakers ( in ceiling ) lc60i for front and middle speakers and rc60i for the surround speakers . i 'm awaiting for toshiba hd-xa2 that was recently ordered to complement our system and would be replacing my current infinity subwoofer with a hsu stf-2 sub . originally my first choice was a pioneer vsx-1016 receiver but with lack of zone 2 and hdmi video pass-thru only . i did n't think it fit our needs . however , onkyo tx-sr604b not only was a true bargain but it also exceeded my expectations , ease of use ( very easy setup ) user friendly powerful enough to drive all my polk speakers clean and crisp sound . i did'nt have any problem as far as clicking sound related to hdmi issues like few folks have mentioned on their reviews and i did n't mind running extra component cable to my tv knowing it does n't up-convert component to hdmi . the only thing that i have n't tested it yet was the zone 2 feature . i 'm planning to install my extra pair rc60i in wall speakers to our master bathroom hopefully soon so ca n't comment on that part yet . overall we 're very pleased with our purchased thanks amazon !
0	nothing that uses fw400 responds to being plugged into this device , whether is it bus powered or not . bloody useles
0	i found this paper on amazon as an accessory to the olympus camedia p-400 printer . this paper does not fit the p-400 because this paper is too wide . thus , with the p-400 , this paper is useless
1	after installing the card , i booted up my windows xp and it locked up . after rebooting again , however , the card worked fine and has continued to work fine . i 've only had the card for two days , and so far i am very happy with it . here 's my setup : windows xp home edition , direct tv set-top box , and a standard cable from the set-top box into the card . since the set-top box is in the other room , i 'm just using the set-top box remote to set it on the right channel . a little tedious , but it 's fine for recording a few shows . i have n't tried the remote that came with the card ( i assume it does n't work through walls ) . the wintv 2000 software is not very user friendly , but i have n't found any bugs in it yet . i chose not to install the software and drivers from the cd . instead , i downloaded all of the latest versions directly from the manufacturer 's web site
0	i would never buy this tv again or a samsung product for that matter . i obviously purchased a lemon , have had two different service calls to come out and try to fix it with no luck . samsung initially told me i would get an exchange but then got hung up on and when i called back i was told my two service calls only count as one because they were in a 30 day period . how 's that for sound logic . i really like it when it works , but , unfortunately , an important aspect of a tv is that you can expect to turn on when you press the power button .
0	i 've been using this remote since it was released . better than any others i 've run into , but when it gets a glitch which all software driven devices are susceptible too , be prepared to give up a couple of hours . when it 's working , it 's a 5 star device , however ... read on as to why i give it a 2 . as i type this , my hold time is up to 45 minutes on the phone to 2nd level support . 3rd call today . i simply got a new pvr . programmed ok , but it is n't the default device when i watch tv . also , it took two calls to find out my directv pvr is not a pvr , it 's a `` satellite '' . as a `` pvr '' , it could n't be added to activities because `` you do n't have a device that will change channels '' . news to me . never known a pvr that could n't change channels . literally , 4 friggin ' hours so far and it still not right . at some point , the tv suddenly stopped turning on . 2-3 hours on that issue and it 's still not right . tv does not go on until i hit the `` help '' button on the remote . to add insult to injury , i ca n't access the website . enter my email as an id and am told it 's already in the database . i ask for a password reminder via email and get a message that my email address is not recognized . i hate that the software does n't have a simple `` home '' button . you have to go through several menus to get back to it . hold time now up to 52 minutes . i have to hang up for an appt. , so the hold has to be repeated ... .again . oh yeah ... i also dislike the size of the buttons , especially the numbers . cell phone sized . no doubt designed for a dainty child . i could go on , but if another comes out with a product like this one , i 'll be looking hard at it
0	i live in san francisco and have generally good radio reception . this unit could not receive normal fm stations that table radios sitting right next to it could pick up ... and i used the fancy `` dipole '' antenna on the boston accoustics unit and the other table radios only had an internal antenna . the hd part of the radio is total junk . sometimes the audio `` skips '' and sometimes the signal is lost and reacquired ( meaning 3 or 4 second drop-outs . ) all in all , there 's nothing good about this radio . do n't buy it .
1	i love this arm band . i have had it for about 6 months now . you dont have to take your ipod out of the arm band to charge it or to hook it up to your computer . i also only use my ipod for the gym , so its nice that this arm band provides great protection ( better than ipod 's armbands because it fits snugly and wont scratch it when you put it on ) as well as not coming off while working out .
1	excellent value -- these batteries are just as good as name brands for about half the price . if you use a lot of aa 's , this is the way to go -- made especially nice if you use them as a filler to get your shipping free on your entire order if it is hovering in the $ 18 range
1	title : intuos3 tablet publisher : wacom publish date : unknown isbn/model # : ptz631w reviewer : robert saucier rating : 5 stars in 1997 , after buying a new top-of-the-line 450mhz pentium ii system , i splurged on a wacom artz ii tablet . oh , my ! pressure-sensitive , tilt-sensing , pointer control , assignable function pads ; it was heaven . after a couple of years , every time i tried to use it with my primary graphics application , my computer would spontaneously reboot -- a bit counter-productive . i watched for new drivers and new versions of my application but , as technology marched on , my beloved tablet and graphics application continued their spats . sadly , i disconnected the tablet and gently packed it away . lately , i 've been feeling the pull once more , that urge to use a pen to do photo touch-ups instead of my mouse . miraculously , a wacom intuos3 6-inch by 11-inch tablet dropped , almost literally , into my lap . sleek , gun-metal gray , sexy -- with a comfort-grip pen ( much like my coveted pilot g2 pens ) and a mouse ! even better , the intuos3 comes bundled with 3 applications that show off its capabilities : adobe elements 4.0 , corel painter essentials 3 , and nik color efex 2.0 le . heaven just got better ! the intuos3 has over 5000 lines per inch of resolution , over twice that of the wacom graphire product line , and , with its usb 2 connection , there 's more than enough communication bandwidth , meaning better tablet to application response . one hesitation i have when adding a new piece of hardware is in regard to what the driver will do to my system ; will it introduce instability or get along with everyone else . the intuos3 driver has been rock-solid in the two weeks that the tablet has been living with me . i 've used all of my `` usual '' programs and have had no problems at all . the tablet has also been peacefully co-existing with two external drives , a wireless desktop receiver , a card reader , a scanner , and a printer , all riding the same usb bus . the intuos3 has 8 `` chordable '' buttons , 4 at each side of the tablet , to which keys , macros , or other actions may be assigned . the default for each group are the usual alt , ctrl/command , and shift , along with `` space '' . the placement of the buttons allows you to keep a grip on the tablet , holding one or more of the buttons , while tapping whatever key on the keyboard with your pen hand . being chordable , you can hold any or all of the buttons down for those tricky shortcuts like alt-ctrl-s or to the side of each of the two button pads are touch strips which can be independently programmed as well . the default setting is to scroll or depending on the context . the ends of the strip , in keystroke mode , can be set to playback macros . the pen , with its 1024-level pressure-sensitive stylus and `` eraser , '' also has a duoswitch . the duoswitch 's two positions may also be programmed . the pen action is smooth with the default nylon nib -- there are different types of nibs to simulate different types of tactile feedback . with the ergonomic grip , the pen is extremely comfortable to hold . the 5-button mouse , designed to be used by either `` righties '' or `` lefties , '' is not as ergonomically correct but considering the versatility , this is more than acceptable . as with every other clickable/pressable feature associated with the intuos3 , the mouse buttons are programmable with a ridiculous number of options , although i 've yet to find the `` fix photo , '' `` illustrate article , '' or even the `` design website '' settings . i can see only two very minor changes that i would make to this fantastic product . i would love to see the ability to add weight to the pen . it is just a bit too light for my personal tastes and considering how configurable the tablet is already , this feature would be the feather on the cap to me . the other change would be making the drawing surface transparent as it is on the graphire ( and was on the artz ii ) . sometimes , having the ability to trace an outline can save significant time . for the casual home user , i would recommend the graphire product line -- this intuos3 model 's srp of $ 369 may be a bit high where a $ 99 entry point on the graphire is more affordable . for the pro-consumer or professional , however , whether doing photo editing ( my primary use ) or illustration , the intuos3 line is well worth the investment . it 's great to be in heaven again ...
1	this is a surprisingly good radio at this price . it is small , compact and yet very robust and quite heavy . it is nothing like the cheapie plastic radios one sees in the drug store . here are three things i really liked about this product : 1 ) the am/fm reception is outstanding . i am in a bad area with few stations and this model gets them in clean and clear . listening to fm on my stereo headphones was a real pleasure . 2 ) the buttons and controls are easy to use and sensible in function . this is something sangean seems to get very well . 3 ) the multi-level display lighting can be turned off , or up in 3 steps from dull to very bright . a few things i did n't like . the pilot light for `` on '' is a like an intense blue laser and lights up the entire room at night . i had to put black electrical tape over it . the aux input is a mini-jack instead of rca connector . minor inconvenience here . and finally , the cabinet is nice wood , but the finish is not as good as i think it could be . this radio is a pleasure to use and it sounds better than i expected for this price . it 's a keeper
0	i 've purchased and attempted to install three of these adapters . one of them was on an older dell laptop , installed without any problems at all and connected seamlessly to a linksys wrt54g router with wap encryption . the problems really started showing when i tried to install the second and third adapters , both on desktop computers running windows xp sp2 . the software installation was a breeze , but when i plugged in the adapter - nothing happened . connect to network ... which network ? scan..who ? what ? it looks like this adapter has a very , very short range and does n't work very well a wall or two in between the routers . it would see the router and connect - to drop the connection and not find one . but then it would find it again , and on and off . never really worked as expected on the desktops , so i 've given up . i 've had to disconnect them and reconnect them multiple times . downloaded the updated software from belkin 's site , and still have connection issues with the desktops . the laptop works fine as long as i do n't take it one room away from the router . avoid at all costs please . i 've used other wireless devices with the same router that i 'm trying to connect and they work fine - a few rooms away and all . spend a few more dollars and get something worth the money spent . spend less time troubleshooting and more time surfing . good luck
0	this was my second netgear product i bought ( previously a wireless modem which i was only okay with not impressed ) the idea of a network storage appeals to me . but this drive just is not good . in reading the previous reviews i found that it was a finicky thing , and be careful on the drives you buy for it . well i searched and searched and found a drive that worked and bought both yesterday . tried to set it up today and connecting the drive went pretty well , but that is where everything started to go down hill . midway through the install it tells you to okay any error messages ( which turn out to be things like this is untested on xp and might not work kind of errors ) and suddenly my computer reboots . figured it would have told me it was going to do so oh well , and it never goes back to the install like most programs do when they require a reboot . tried again , same thing happens . started poking around and find out that not only do you have to check the drive you put in to the sc101 , you need to look in to your own computer . to quote netgears web site , `` scsi disk drivers from the promise company conflict with the sc101 device drivers . promise drivers are typically used for raid 1 or for sata drives . many newer computers use promise sata drivers . '' my computer is just a week old and has these newer drivers . back in the box the sc101 goes , and i try to uninstall the software as this product will not work for me . tried the 3 things when you have trouble it suggests , and none work . this is where i get really frustrated , netgear support . i waited 35 minutes for someone to pick up the phone , who ultimately told me it was my own fault and i 'd have to pay to have that `` cr*p '' , yes he said it , from my system . i needed to hire a local computer vendor and it would be my bill . i have to pay to get this junk off my computer . way to support your products netgear . the tech support person who got on the phone had an accent that was hard to understand , and went through huge mood swings during the call , from happy , to argumentative , to depressed , to happy again . i was freaked that this person knew my home address ! all in all , this is a great concept . after reading up on it and now experiencing it , i think it needs a ton more engineering and refinement before it is brought to market . maybe by a company with better customer service . it really requires a level of technical expertise that is not there with the average consumer
1	the only thing i will say about the bdp-s1 is that it is top quality . picture and sound quality are top-notch , but everything really depends on the software . now , if you are undecided about which camp to follow ( blu-ray or hd dvd ) , i 'm here to tell you that blu-ray will win . you see , i have both blu-ray and hd dvd . i have about 20 hd dvd movies and about 20 blu-ray movies . in terms of picture and sound quality , they are the same , but it is completely dependant on the software . but here is where the similarities end . 1 ) blu-ray is more durable . the bd movie discs have scratch-resistant coating . they do n't scratch unless you forcefully scratch them . on the other hand , the hddvd movies scratch like heck . i put all of my movies in a cd case . i recently noticed that all the hddvd movies are scratched , but none of the blu-ray movies are scratched . these are stored in the same cd case by me . i am extremely careful . none of my movies even have a fingerprint on them . so when i see scratches on 100 % of my hddvd movies , that really upsets me ! ! ! ! ! 2 ) blu-ray costs less to buy . what ? superman returns bd is $ 24 , superman hddvd is $ 28 . the departed bd is $ 24 , the departed hddvd is $ 28 . now the hddvd dual format has both a standard dvd and hddvd movie , but who in their right mind would want to buy an hddvd to watch a 480p picture ? right now you can get a $ 500 ps3 or $ 400 toshiba hddvd player . later this year , sony will come out with a $ 300 blu-ray disc player . hddvd will most likely drop their prices . so the hardware will cost the same in both formats . 3 ) blu-ray has more capacity . for less money , you can get a 50gb blu-ray movie versus a 30gb hddvd movie . and what if in 5 years they develope super high-definition 1920p picture and super hi-def 8.1 dts-hd sound ? what if this requires 75gb or 100gb ? hddvd can go up to 51gb . peace .
1	we have the original itrips but wanted this one for travel since it is much eaiser to tune in . the originals work great around town because it is always set on the same station . after reading the instructions i plugged the new itrip in and it worked perfectly just like the originals . not only did it work but it worked from 40 feet away . that is better than i expected after reading all the feedback . i 'm not sure what everyones problem is . it 's not a radio tower , it 's a transmitter the size of your finger . i get the feeling that some people think it should power the city block .
0	at first i loved the compact iaudio player , but after the first week , the earphone input ( hole in the player ) , did n't hold the input jack securely , resulting in no sound . i could jiggle it in the hole resulting in sound for about a second , but could not get it to work continuously . unfortunately , i threw away my receipt and box , or i would return it
1	the klipsch igroove can go toe to toe with the more expensive bose sound wave all day long . i researched dockable ipod / mp3 players for a few months before i decided on this one for my wife 's office . i 'm fussy when it comes to quality audio equipment , the i-grove does not disappoint . it provides room filling sound with no distorion . i listened to it extensively before wrapping it up for xmas to make sure it had the quality i insist on . it delivered . another bonus with the klipsch is it 's ability to accomodate other mp3 players and / or personal compact disc players . i 'm completely satisfied with my purchase of the klipsch i-groove .
0	purchased a total of 20 of these . i previously sold the american international brand sirius antenna but there was a temporary shortage in the market . four of the twenty terk brand units were dead on installation . sadly , i thought terk was a quality brand . my mistake !
0	i bought this to record tivo dvr stuff to dvd . worst frame rate capture and audio capture of .avi 's of the four different devices i have tried . completely unusable . the software is a trial version . instead , buy the ads dvdxpress dx2 for a bit more . ulead 's software is stable , and it 's not a trial version . it is also the only analog capture device i have tried that gives a good picture using mpeg capture . pinnacle 's dazzle only is tolerable using avi capture which is great if you have the drive space , but the software is way too buggy
0	no kidding ! ! the shipping charge on these batteries was over $ 6.00 . amazon does n't itemize the shipping charges on your order , so if you order multiple items , you wo n't know that you 're being raped by crutchfield until it is too late !
1	i agree that these are not top of the line . but they are n't bad at all . i get coasters occassionally even from top of the line media . i always burn at half the speed the media is designed for - 2x in this case . it takes longer , but i get good results . i am rarely in a hurry to burn a dvd . i would buy these again . ** updated on 7/3/2005 ** i have bought a new computer recently and i have been burning these dvds with full speed supported by the writer and no coasters what-so-ever . very happy with this product
1	compact flouresecent bulbs will not fit this fixture unless you order special cf 's with extended bases . other than that , it ca n't be beat for the price and quality . adorama rocks
0	the use of this ac power adaptor has increased the amount of static to the point where using the radio with the adaptor is pointless . on battery the radio works very well , just attach the adaptor and all reception is lost . invest in batteries rather than this product .
1	i love this product . the earbuds were even better than i had expected . i wanted something small that would n't hurt my ears and i wanted a long cord and that is just what i got . i am very happy with the product and the service . thank yo
0	i was looking for a small cheap mp3 player and i did n't care how much memory it had so this seemed perfect for me . i saw that many people had rated this 4 and 5 stars so i decided to buy it . when i got the creative nano i was really happy with its preformance until i tried to put my subscription music onto it . thats when i learned that it would n't hold any subscription music forcing me to buy my music one by one which is costing a lot of money . after that i started realising all of its imperfections . you ca n't use the fm radio in the car without hearing mostly static . you ca n't search through songs without actually changing the song you are listening to . do n't get me wrong , there are some good sides to this mp3 player but i still would definately not recommend it
0	if they were n't free , i 'd give them 1 star . media code : mcc 01rg20 . 2 of 10 were coasters at 4x with my dvdrw ide1008
1	these phones are great . sound quality is very good , including the speaker phone option . phones have many handy features , and all features are intuitive to use . no problem with the range . very easy to set up . battery life has proven to be no concern so far . the phones feel comfortable in the hand . i could n't be happier
1	sent quickly and nicely packaged . these will do the job for those desiring a shorter recording program
1	everything about the sonos worked as advertised . it was a snap to set up and it is slicker than i anticipated . the interface is commonsense and well thought out . it is the only decent solution for tying together multiple discrete sound systems within a house to play the same music simultaneously . you can also play different music , all obtained from the same computer source or internet radio . it is one of those rare products that instead of disappointing actually packs many pleasant surprises
1	totally agree with the other reviewers ' comments . originally , i was going to buy canon 's adapter for my powershot a640 not realizing it was plastic ! ! plus , even with shipping , this is still cheaper ( by 5 bucks ) and its metal ! fyi -- if you do n't have any filters ( like i did n't ) get tiffens 3 filter set 52mm ( circular polarizer , uv protector , and 812-warming len ) a good buy for the price -- i bought it because of the reviewers ' comments and do n't regret it
1	product performs per specifications and is easy to use . would like to see fuse easier to replace
0	sony advertised this as a 18x burner for dvd+r media . i used the recommended brand ( verbatim ) and taiko-yuden which are very high end media . i was only backing up home movies from my panasonic camcorder . the movies are in .mpeg format , i was only writing data and it should be no problem for any writter . unfortunately , i got only 12x write speed with the provided software , in a mac as well as in a pc . ( just slower than advertised , no clusters ) . it is a noisy drive too . i spoke with sony costumer service and i could not get any satisfactory answers . i had to wait a long time to be helped . they said that the drive was probably damaged . i returned it and i do not think the drive quality or the customer support represents the price of this drive .
0	i suffered with this clock for a year because it was a gift and expensive . even on the lowest setting the blue glow is so bright my finace says it looks like an alien spaceship is landing in the room . the sound is so-so and it has no battery backup , lose power for a second and you have to reset everthing . it is also very big , taking up 1/2 my nightstand . the final straw was that it has trouble tuning in even the strongest radio stations where i live . this morning i finally gave in , accepted reality and tossed it in the trash . i wo n't miss it at all
1	i enjoy this mouse . usually , i do n't like using the touch pad on laptops but after deciding to buy a mouse , i had to look for a specific mouse that would fit into my lifestyle as a student . i have small hands and i hate carrying out heavy objects in my bookbag . since i have to lug my laptop around , i needed a mouse that did n't take a lot of space , is good enough to withstand constant shifting in my laptop , and that worked well with my needs . pros : small size , optical , scrolling tab , and portability cons : sometimes the mouse jumps around a bit on its own . but this happens only a few times every few weeks - so it 's not often enough to cause a problem for me . enjoy
1	buy it and you will not live home without it . if i would rate this product , i will rated a 6 stars .
1	works well , especially for anyone who still has their old console systems in use . i have my nes and snes , both of which have huge ac adapters , plugged into this . it saves tons of space on my power strip . the design is a little clumsy though , so it 's only getting 4/5
0	these xtreme cd cases stinks , literally ! i do n't know what kind of plastic material they are using and if they are toxic , but the smell is absolutely nauseous . i kept it for two weeks hoping the smell would go away . nope . finally i threw it away . other than the smell , quality-wise it is ok .
0	this media did not work on my brand new asus burner , even after updating the firmware
1	this is an awesome little device . let me start with the pros : 1 ) easy : incredibly easy setup ( literally press one button - never believed it , but it 's true . plug in the usb transmitter , press the blue button voila . ) 2 ) good sound : for a small set of speakers , these things sound great . they are not going to compare to speakers hooked up to your rack stereo system , but sound very good and comparable to a $ 45 two-speaker set of monitor-side speakers . there 's a built in sub-woofer that helps as well . 3 ) wireless range : with 4 aa batteries , you can carry this little guy around your whole house - and outside your house . reception is great . i am used to bluetooth headsets that do n't really work much further than 10 feet from the phone - i had doubts about bluetooth speakers , but i am amazed with reception these guys have . 4 ) controls : the forward , reverse pause buttons on the speaker work fine with both media player or yahoo music engine running on the laptop ( the only two i tried ) . again , i was surprised , but they worked flawlessly . 5 ) cool : as far as cool factor , this little guy is definitely that . cons : 1 ) no remote : it would be nice if there was a remote control for the unit that would allow you to control the sound , ff , rw , pause , play controls . 2 ) no control from pc : you ca n't control the sound ( or mute ) from the laptop - only from the speakers . 3 ) sound : above i said the sound was good - and it is considering the size of this system . however , these are small speakers and a mini-sub and the sound is thus somewhat small too . it 's good , but it 's not going to compare to a quality set of speakers hooked up to your rack stereo system . there is base but not a great deal - you definitely wo n't feel the music with these speakers . 4 ) volume : volume is limited - it 's enough to fill a mid-sized room , but not much more . for $ 100 , this is an outstanding little speaker system that does an amazing job with no wires . carry it to your kid 's room . to the garage . to the basement . no wires , nothing . if convenience is and portability is important to you , and if medium sound quality is ok , then i would highly recommend this speaker system . it 's great . personally , i 'm not sure if i 'm going to keep them because i would really like fuller sound ( this was an attempt at easy speakers for my living room ) and more base - but they 're so cool and convenient , that i doubt i 'll be able to give them up ! for other bluetooth ideas and wi-fi network options , see my post at the hydrogen audio forum : [ ... ]
1	it costs 30 % - 40 % less than the canon la-dc58f conversion lens adapter and it 's metal , not plastic ... need to say more
1	i use the memory card in my samsung d807 phone . works perfecty
0	this is a piece of junk holy cow is it cruddy do n't even call it a guitar because its not its a bad thing to call it a guitar holy crud `` where 's the tylenol !
0	there 's a reason this thing is only 6 bucks . it 's absolute junk . i put it into the cassette player in my car , and the sounds were completely distorted . the voice constantly skips , and the casette sometimes clicks . the quality of sound in my car is usually amazing , and basically there was no bass sound coming through my speakers using this device . i 've tried both sides , but still no avail . i plan on returning it if shipping does n't cost more than the product itself
0	i 'm sure this product is fine . but do n't order it through amazon , through ritz camera . they just cancelled my order without warning , having listed that the bag was available . freaking idiots
1	what i ordered - on time delivery - good price
0	we bought this machine for a christmas present for the inlaws , knowing i 'd wind up installing it . the first disk played fine , but while i was eating lunch my father-in-law tried moving to a different cd . it would n't play . it 'd go back to the first disk and play it fine . so , i shut it down , restarted on disk 2 and now it played fine , but would n't go back and play disk 1 ! i moved the disks around to other slots and still they skipped like an old-fashioned vinyl record with a scratch . both cds worked fine in another player . in the meantime , mother-in-law is busy putting her collection of cds into groups for me to program . not this holiday season . this sucker 's going back to the big box store from wence it came !
1	this arm-band is surprisingly good . i initially got it for my boyfriend for his iriver , but i was afraid it would n't fit his arms since he 's very muscular . surprisingly - it stretched enough and was n't tight ! he loves it . i thought there might be too much motion on mine when i run or use the eliptical , but no , it 's fine
1	outstanding cleaner for your cd or cdrw , mp3 player . takes you through many diagnostic tests . even has a dolby test . well worth the money and you will be more than pleased with it . i used it on both my pc cd and cdrw drives as well as my stereo cd player . fantastic product ! !
0	i was impressed with this controller at first , and found it to feel comfortable , and work well . it was played with once and a while for about a month ( total 10 hours max ) . some time after that , the next time i went to use it , it would only go left in a game that used the left joystick . i could not get it to center ( or even stay still ) , it would just keep either steering the car ( like burnout3 ) or whatever the left joystick would do for the game no matter what . i tried it several times , and it has never worked since . i fire it up once and a while to see if it 's still doing it , and it does . i am very dissapointed in this , and i was pretty careful about getting this newer version of the logitech controller . i think i paid about $ 45 locally for it , and i just bought a pelican extreme edge from radio shack on clearance for $ 19.99 that works and feels as good , but is less than half the cost . i do n't really feel like going thru a warranty claim , if it 's even covered , but it still annoys me every time i look at it in my xbox 'drawer ' of extra stuff . i was going to go totally wireless ( 4 units ) and luckily did n't run out and buy 3 more of these logitech controllers . i instead bought some extra microsoft s controllers , as they are still one of the best feeling controllers out there . if the pelican holds up , ( model pl-2050 version 2.0 ) i might go get some more if i can find them locally .
0	these are $ 10 headphones . there 's nothing amazing about them in my opinion . i bought them to use with my ipod when i 'm out , or at work . right out of the box , i was disappointed with the fit , and i know everyone is going to be different , but for me they just are n't comfortable . the sound quality is clear , but very thin and lacking bass . even when i 'm pressing them into my ears to get the best possible fit , the bass just is n't good . eq settings to boost the bass do n't help either , and often reduce sound quality even more . the ear clips do n't really seem to do that much either . they kind of keep them on your ears but do n't really hold them in your ears at all . the ear pieces tend to get tangled together easily as well . in summary , i would n't recommend these for music , but if you want a cheap pair of headphones for listening to audio books or some other kind of spoken word , they might be good-if you can tolerate them in your ears for that long
1	i agree with the prior review of these jbl e10s , however i 'd go to the e20s for a small room main stereo set -- better bass worth the slight price increase . bought for rear channel ( rc ) use , i find the e10s quite `` airy '' , with what seems like a better high frequency response than the main e30s i just bought from a'.com ( see my 5 star review ) , giving extremely open and detailed `` surround '' rc performance . note : the specs listed on a'.com for the e10s state `` bi-wireable : yes '' but ... unless jbl has just changed the terminals to do this that 's wrong -- mine have just a single terminal set , and do n't bother with the pricey speaker mounts offered as accessories ( unless you plan ceiling installs ) as they come with two `` slide down '' screw slots attached to the back for wall installation . surfing for the best price , i bought mine refurbished from [ ... ] for a low $ 53.00 bid plus $ 18.00 s+h directly from jbl and you may find the e30s/e20s from jbl as refurbs there as well . as rc speakers -- especially at the price i got them -- i recommend them highly , well deserving the 5 star rating given
1	i am extrememly happy with this one . for the price , it delivers well . the voice recorder works well . my key need was to record lectures and listening to them . worked out very well
0	300-500 yards under the best conditions . given its heft , a waste of mone
0	this is not an xd to compactflash card adapter . if you order this item number , you will receive a pc card adapter that accepts xd picture cards and smartmedia cards and fits your pcmia 2.1 slot on a pc or mac . it is not for a camera or substitute for a compactflash card . there is nothing compact flash about it . the product you will recieved does not look like the photo on amazon 's website
1	this is exactly what i was looking for : not too expensive , not much hassle with the cables - they are integrated with the unit , and no need to reach for the button to switch computers - simply press `` scroll lock '' twice to go from one computer to the other . cables are pretty long , which is good : longer that i need at the moment , but i may appreciate the extra length in the future .
1	just remember to use the proper cable , cat 5e or cat 6
0	i agree with the other review , sony brand vhs tapes have begun a steady decline in quality over the past years . as a almost life long user of sony premium grade tapes , i have begun to notice a sharp drop in the picture and sound quality i get when i record , even off my dish . the picture is never up to snuff with what i see when i watch the show as it is being recorded . for the past two years , i have been able to notice the differences when i am watching something on a sony tape , the flaws have become to big to ignore . i will be buying tdk from now on , and i suggest you do the same . sony used to make a great vhs tape , but i guess they are concentrating now on making more playstations
0	consumers should be aware of serious design flaws which exist in samsung dlp televisions . cooling fans and color wheels are highly susceptible to failing . ( as a non-techniocal person i should have no idea what these parts are , but alas , i bought a samsung dlp ) expect these to fail within 1-2 years . expect to pay approx $ 400 to replace the color wheel and $ 200 to replace the colling fan . that is , if your service technician can find them in stock anywhere . these parts are commonly in a national backorder because of the very high failure rates . you should also expect the lamp to fail sooner than advertized . many people need to purchase a new lamp between 1-2 years , and some more often than that . the lamp costs approx $ 150- $ 250 depending on your model , but you should be able to replace it yourself without too much difficulty . this cost will be in addition to replacement costs for the color wheel and colling fan . please remember that these maintenance costs are recurring , and you will have to fix them again in another 1-2 years . while i was very satisfied with the quality and performance of my dlp , my color wheel failed very early . i called tech support to report a grinding noise , and was told to `` turn it off '' , wait 15 minutes , and turn it back on like this would fix the problem . after doing this for a while , the color wheel finally failed , actually shattered ! now i am out of warranty , and samsung wants nothing to do with me . i have even tried ordering the part myself from two different online vendors , and they are both backordered indefinitely ! it has been 6 weeks and they have no estimate for when this part will be available . samsung can not even give me an estimate when the supply of replacement parts is expected to meet demand . i have had my tv for 18 months , and apparently there is a national epidemic of them breaking at the same time ! i have a 42 '' samsung plasma which is a beautiful set along with a 26 '' crt . both are wonderful products , but samsung is selling dlp lemons and will not stand behind them . dlp is a great bargain up front , but a maintenance nightmare ! you will pay in the long run , and by the long run i mean every 2 years . if you still want to purchase a dlp television , please buy the extended warranty ! it will save you a ton , but you will still have to wait for the circuit city tech to find parts which may take months ! i expect samsung to abandon their design flaw riddled dlp sector , and focus on their beautiful plasma line . expect dlp prices to drop even further , but please ... look before you leap
0	i bought these head phones because i read all the reviews that gave it 4 's and 5 's , so i expected a lot out of them . the truth is you really should n't ... they do n't sound particularly awesome and i was rather disappointed that i actually spent close to $ 30.00 after shipping and stuff . the mid-highs and highs sound fine , but i had issues with bass and mid-low response , especially when i plugged it into my computer . plus they are not super comfortable either ; the hinges nip at your neck when you do n't have them on your head and they fit funny if you have glasses . all in all , i wished i had spent my money on something else . but they do look pretty cool .
1	this card works exactly as stated by startech . i bought two - one for a pc and one for a mac , popped 'em in and plugged in ipods , external hardrives , a scanner , and digital cameras and the cards worked perfectly . the pc needed a quick setup and the mac worked instantly ! and all at a great price ! ca n't figger out why you guys are having trouble
0	the product does not work in my view . i have to review every card and have to manually correct the extracted information in 95 % of the cases . it is not much different than entering the information manually . the character recognition software has a long way to go to be effective . does not even recognize that `` wireless '' is the mobile phone number . one would think that they would get it right after all these versions and years . the only good thing is once you scan the cards , you can throw them away , but still have to spend the same amount time entering the information by hand .
1	i do n't understand the 1 star reviews , unless there is some product variability . price was $ 60 at target . talk time is ok , although the longest i have been on the phone is maybe 10 or 15 minutes . range is fine . phone works all over the house , and audio quality if fine
0	we wanted the zoom and missed the fact that this one does not have the zoom . the reason i give two stars is because of beach camera 's return policy . they grudgingly allowed me to return it , as a one-time courtesy with a restocking fee . i wish amazon would tag the vendors so we could easily see if we were buying from this type of company
1	the pro and cons described by other reviews are valid . i was specifically looking for a boombox that has cassette , mp3 , cd and radio capability . so did n't have much of an option but to get this one . i am impressed with the sound quality but agree that there could have been improvements related to interface and some of the functionality . overall i think its a good buy .
1	we used this remote to program a sony av-rm3000 remote , but we need more flexibility for our htpc . in hindsight , we should have bought a stand-alone ir unit and something like the girder software . or , maybe just an ir wireless keyboard . this is not a remote for those seeking flexibility , or those who like to customize their media experience . this is an excellent remote for those who want out-of-the-box usability , and do n't want to bother with customization . it 's well-built , and will be exactly what many mainstream users are looking for . pros : comfortable shape , sensible layout , high-quality feel , reasonably compatible with many programs cons : does n't do absolutely everything in every compatible application , only four somewhat-programmable keys with limited option
0	they totally misrepresent this product . it does not work with macs . i feel cheated and lied to by memorex , shame on you
0	i have the luxury of writing this review a little bit further out in the technology cycle than most of the others , so i can say : just get yourself a better wireless router . based on the reviews here , several online fora , and my own personal experience , i can confirm to you that you have about a 30 % chance of actually getting this to work , and you might get that percentage up a little bit if you keep returning defective ones and trying another . but why bother ? at this point , there are higher-power routers , high-gain directional antennae , and there are even products sporting 802.11n , which inherently has a better range that -a , -b , or -g. if you 've gotten into a situation where your router is inadequate for your needs , research and get yourself a top-notch router with good broadcast power -- i would strongly recommend against trying to remedy an inadequate router by trying to add this product to your network . i understand that my suggestion may be more expensive , but i am seriously saying that you will avoid wasting any more than necesary of the precious remainder of your time on this earth . definitely hours ( if , by some miracle , everything works on the 12th or 13th try ) , and probably a couple of days ( assuming that after 24 or 25 tries you send back the first one and try again with a new one )
0	i just got it and am fighting my way through getting it to work in vista ultimate . it claims to have a qam tuner , but i 'll be damned if it can find any digital/hd channels on my cable . my qam tv gets many . very disappointed , documentation is at best lacking . look elsewhere .
0	tilting the foot rest back and forth is not the easiest thing in the world . it 's just cheap plastic rubbing on cheap plastic so it sticks a lot . mine broke in 2 different spots within a month..
0	got it in december ; cd player stopped working in april and now the radio reception is so bad i 'm tossing it . ca n't provide paperwork for refund as it was a gift
1	the lable maker was removed from the box and put into action with ease . product is easy to use and understand . for the money a great purchase .
0	i connected all the cables as instructed , but it does n't work , the light is not on . so i return it to amazon
1	i just recently bought a sub-woofer and i spent a good deal of time searching for an interconnect . the interconnects i looked at ranged from ridiculously over-priced to questionably cheap . i knew i wanted it to be thx certified and of a length that would allow me some freedom of sub-woofer placement . this interconnect provided both at a very reasonable price . i must say after installing my subwoofer that this cable was a perfect choice . some might say that the cost reflects a cables ability to provide good sound . wrong . this is just as good as those 70 dollar interconnects . i do buy monster cable for most of my home theatre needs , but i do not buy into some of the hype surrounding monster cable and their more expensive cables . why only 4 and not 5 stars . i did not like the way the cable was packaged . the cable was folded down the middle and now the center of the cable has a crook in it . i would have perfered it to be wound around a plastic spool to avoid folding of the cable . getting past that , its a good interconnect that produces great sound .
1	i 've owned and use the sony 256mb memory stick pro pictured ( in black ) , and currently also use a 1gb sony memory stick pro . i 've not had any problems with them , formatting or otherwise , over long periods of heavy use . ok , a little pricier than , say , sd cards , but a good quality product for sony digital cameras .
0	i 've only got this thing to work for about 3 hours and that is not in a row . i 've spent hours with this product on several machines and i can now say the hardware sucks .
1	things that i like : ( 1 ) the option to tile the front of the keyboard up makes typing much more comfortable . i was a skeptic about it before i purchased it , but really do like it . also , this is the first keyboard that i have used that allows for so many typing angles . ( 2 ) the included software gives a great deal of control over customizing all of the extra keys on the keyboard . even if you do n't have windows vista , you can program the gadgets key to suit your needs . ( 3 ) the keyboard has no lag for me , whatsoever . ( 4 ) i 'm a big fan of the standard 3x2 key setup for the home keys , etc . ( 5 ) this is a small change , but i 'm using this setup on dell inspiron 6000 laptop . the software replaced the large volume notifications ( onscreen display showing volume level , mute , etc . ) with a smaller more attractive style notification . me gusta . ( 6 ) the curved keyboard is also comfortable . it requires no time nor effort getting used to it . ( 7 ) i have n't had any problems with the keyboard being `` out of range . '' ( 8 ) for the mouse , i 'm switching from the wireless intellimouse explorer 3.0 , which is also made by microsoft , to the laser 6000 mouse included . this new mouse is more comfortable . ( not a huge difference , but noticeable . ) it is also lighter , and slides around with little effort . what i do n't like : ( 1 ) the lock key above the number pad is set by default to display the same two options as when you click 'start ' then 'log off windows . ' i would have liked the option to change the key to the shut down / hibernate dialog instead . i have n't found that option available , so far . ( 2 ) the keyboard is a little bit wider than others , but i do n't find it to be a problem . it 's just different . having the additional programmable buttons outweighs the downside of having the extra width . five stars
1	below is my experience with this product after owning it for 2 weeks . pros : -- -- - 1 . amazing sound especially when watching dvd movies 2 . very good progessive scan dvd picture quality 3 . simple , compact and all-in-one design 4 . remote control can work with various tv 's , cable boxes and vcr 's 5 . can play both ntsc and pal dvd 's cons : -- -- - 1 . expensive 2 . no hdmi output 3 . non-intuative remote control 4 . no headphone jack overall , i love and chose the bose 321 because of the sound quality and compact design . i got this system because i wanted a compact all-in-one media center and i was not interested in getting a htib with 5 speakers . i looked at denon ( 2 products ) , sony and samsung . i use this on my 23 '' samsung lcd tv using monster component video cables and while i would have preferred to take advatange of its hdmi capabilties , the reality is that i am very happy with this image quality . movies such as lord of the rings , the matrix and hero look and sound fantastic . prior to this i was looking at the sony dav-x1 which is much cheaper and more feature-rich . however the internal turmoils between their consumer electronics and media divisons convince me this would not work for me . for example , my pal dvds can not be played on the sony whereas on the bose it was no problem . i am of the opinion that sony is a directionless company and this is reflected in their products . to be fair you do need to have the right kind of room to take advantage of their truespace 2.1 surround sound feature . my couch is up against the wall with the media center located 12 ft in front of me . according to bose the speakers should ideally be 3 feet away from the tv . sometimes truespace works and sometimes i ca n't hear it . i believe this is true among all the other competitors in this market line and that neither one stands out ahead of the other . if surround sound is really that important to you , then you should get a 5.1 system . this product is perfect for a small room as it takes advantage of the echos of the room where it can fake a 3d sound and would probably not be ideal for a family size rec-room . the audio quality from music cd 's is very good and while i wish this had an ipod port as found on the denon , i am very content using the aux port
1	i bought this memory card for my camera sd500 . at first , i was very dispointed when i only see 1gb on my laptop . after googled around , i realized i need to update my laptop sd reader driver to recognized sd card that is over 1gb . i 'm able to see full 2gb after driver update . just make sure you update your device/laptop firmware/driver first
0	you 'll end up looking for something better . sound fidelity is pretty bad .
0	not very happy with this product . the software on the pc side does n't work well at all . wo n't list all my files and i ca n't get it to update changes or new folders . this bugger has way to big of a foot print . the remote needs a skip function to fast foward through movies . hey i have a xbox with xbmc on it . get a clue , and copy some of it 's functionality . it continues to blow away any of the media players i have purchased
1	the wireless lavalier microphone system is perfect for informational interviewing and personal media management . it provides a portable option to amplified audient properties and gives the user a greater degree of movement during presentations . it can be used as a binary system , ( two separate microphone systems and a small amplifier are needed ) to interview your favorite personality , take testimonials or to exchange opinions with local leaders . the wireless lavalier makes the idea addition to any media kit
0	after purchasing the item in december 2006 it didnt take even a week before the troubles started , it kept freezing after switching it on and took quite long to rebuild the data . at one point , ( after two weeks ) i lost all my data . despite downloading the software from the website the problems didnt disappear and i am basically left with a promising player which doesnt even allow me to listen to music without frezing . since then i am struggling with creative technical support team as there is advise given to charge my battery or download the software from the website ( which both is not been of much help ) this player hasnt been much of use to me yet and i deeply regret having paid 360 usd . i gave it 2 stars because i was able to watch 2 movies while waiting at the airport and travelling , this was quite a pleasure
1	this tv/monitor rocks ! ! i 've been looking for a combo computer monitor and tv that i could use in my office . this lcd does both very well . i 'm writing this review with the lns4696d installed and everything on the screen is very large ( what i wanted ) even at 1600x1200 and the resolution is far better than i expected ! ! ( hint : sharpen the image and set high energy saving mode )
1	like the name suggests , the m-audio audiophile 2496 is for true audiophiles . i have had this card for years and there still is few options that are on par with this card for the same money . the audiophile has a full dynamic range of crisp audio with little distortion . i connect my sound card via digital coaxial cable to my harman kardon avr 240 and the sound is amazingly clear . the one drawback to this card is it may be difficult for some to learn to use at first . however , when quality is essential go with the audiophile 2496 .
0	i 'm not the most gadget inclined person , and this was given to me as a gift because it was easy to install and use . but i have to say i 've had a lot of frustration with this device because the gain for the mic input is tweaked out - it 's either off or on , but there 's not much gradation between the two . in fact i get almost no gain at all until i reach almost the `` 3:00 '' position on the dial . and then it 's a lot , and my vocals tend to clip out with the slightest volume variation . it basically keeps me locked into soft , close singing , and a girl ca n't do that all the time ! other than that i have n't had any problems , but that one almost renders it useless . i do n't know if there 's something more reliable ( and sane ) out there , but if there is , go for that instead . even if it costs more . why spend money on something that does n't work
0	please do n't expect to get the cash back from this purchase as promised ! to date , i 've been denied twice . the second time they said the u p c number was invalid . only , it 's the original u p c barcode ! i was meticulous filing the paperwork , yet they state , `` all required products were not submitted . '' meanwhile , i have phoned amaz0n to lodge a formal complaint . the product itself is average . i 've used better and worse . that said , it 's definitely not worth the full asking price
0	when it works it does extend the range . however , every time you turn off a wirelessly connected pc and turn it on again , the pc is not assigned an ip number . unplug this extender , and the pc is assigned an ip number by the router without any problem . a brief power blackout will cut ip numbers to your wirelessly-connected pcs . i purchased this particular d-link range extender because i wanted to ensure that it works well with my di-624 router . i wasted my money buying this device . it 's useless , and it 's too light to even serve as a door stop..
0	issue solved ! i returned the harmony for a full refund . all thanks to my experience with your wonderful support team . after screwing up everything on christmas day ( it was a christmas present ) ) , your support staff said `` level 2 '' would contact me within 24 hours . after waiting 72 hours , i called `` support '' again yesterday . after waiting 30 minutes , i finally got to speak with a real-live agent who `` could not switch me to level 2 without a supervisor 's approval . '' this was after providing the incident number . that took another 15 minutes . i then waited another 30 minutes ( total now 1:15 ) before i had to leave . i tried again several hours later . after being told `` level 2 was not available . '' i hung up and immediately returned my harmony to ... . thanks , logitech . -keit
1	i purchased this as a gift for my 56-year-old mother who simply ca n't get enough scrabble with her friends . while i did not get the opportunity to use the product myself , she seems quite enthusiastic about its abilities . just make sure your opponents approve and dont think you are trying to cheat .
1	great sound . love the volume control on the wire . great fit to almost any head size or shape . overall a great purchase and i love their product
0	if you are not an it person you will need help setting up .using d-link customer service is a chore due to language issues .i bought the video phone to contact my son in taiwan and it never would connect ==d-link help line ? ? ==could not understand why and were of no help what so ever .i could reach the test location but that was it .=complete waste of money ! !
1	the reception is much better than my old antenna , however , i was expecting instructions to be included with the antenna . after some time i figured out how to hook up the tv and vcr to the antenna
0	wasted hours trying unsuccessfully to install the driver for the iogear gic251u 5-port usb card on a dell optiplex gx-1 running 98se . ( this computer already has 2 usb 1.1 ports . ) the main problem is that the add hardware wizard does not find a *.inf file in the iogear-supplied cd folder and does not recognize the executable program that is in the cd folder . user has to cancel out of the wizard and execute the driver installation file as a stand-alone program . this results in installation of drivers that show up in the device manager . however , the installation wizard comes up at every subsequent reboot and the user must cancel out of it just to get the computer going . installed card seemed to work ok for a d-link wireless adapter , but did not recognize a digital camera that was satisfactorily recognized by one of the non-iogear 1.1 ports . the following actions did not help . ( 1 ) swapping the card to another pci slot , ( 2 ) downloading and installing more recent driver file from iogear website , ( 3 ) three calls to customer support , where i found sympathy but so solution
1	this cartridge is very light , easy to install and allows the printer to print out very good quality , durable black ink on the page . it is competitively priced and stores for about a year after you buy it so if you want to stock up for your office or personal printing needs that 's great ! ( it even comes with an expiration date ! ) hp also packs it well so that it is difficult for the cartridge to become damaged during transit . one thing that i did n't like , however , is that the ink can go quickly . if you print a lot , you might even need to replace this cartridge every ten days or so . my needs are about 20 pages per week and i have to change the cartridge roughly every five to six weeks . that 's not good ; although to be fair to this hp ink cartridge i am printing graphics . four stars ( well , maybe three and one half stars ) for being great ink in an easy to manage and install cartridge . it loses points for not lasting longer .
0	i purchased a sony 5-disk cd changer in 1991 that could shuffle between all five disks . this model can only shuffle tracks on one disk at a time . what were they thinking ? the ability to shuffle tracks between disks was my entire reason for choosing a five disk changer vs. a single disk cd/dvd player . this baby is going back
1	first off ... i like this unit . it 's easy to use , and it does a fine job of taking your old lps and making cds out of them . all you need to do is place a blank audio cd into the deck ( it does n't work with regular data cds ) , hit the phono/aux button , followed by the record button and then after you place the needle on the lp ... take it out of pause . it starts recording instantly . between each song , hit a button and it break the recording into tracks . pretty cool ! it 's got great potential , but there are still a few shortcomings . for example , i was surprised to see that it does n't let you record off of the radio . just as surprising to me was the fact that the radio tuner was n't digital . it 's a pain in the neck having to fiddle with the dial to tune in to your favorite stations . you turn back and forth over and over like it was a radio from 40 years ago . i would n't mind the analog tuner too much if it at least had a handful of presets . this also makes the remote control somewhat useless too . oddly , the remote does have an am/fm button . they should just label it the `` radio '' button , because when you think of it , switching from am to fm or vice versa using the remote makes no sense at all because you would need to re-tune the station too , using the dial . another key point is that the unit does n't have any outputs at all . so you ca n't pipe the output from the turntable into your other systems or use any other speakers . i would rate this as 3.5 stars , but since we ca n't use half stars , i 'll give it 4 for one big reason ... . for all it 's shortcomings , it works , and there are very few alternatives . speaking of alternatives , here are a few other options . 1 . a standalone cd-recorder . i have one of these too . the advantage of this type of deck is that it fits into your existing system like an old cassette deck . in my case , my stand alone unit has two drives , so not only can i record from any source in my system , but i can dub from one drive to the other . also , my deck can make mp3 cds from regular cds ( it 's easier than using a pc , however the song titles are just numbers ) . in my case , i opted not to use this for my lp projects , because i no longer have a turntable . i decided that as long as i needed a new turntable , i might as well pay a bit more for this unit . 2 . crosley makes a simuilar unit , but it costs a bit more and the reviews i read seemed to point out that although it looks better , the turntable itself was flimsy and it skipped a lot . 3 . a portable digital recorder like the ikey plus . i found one of these a few weeks ago and i love it . you plug your turntable or other external source into it ... plug a usb storage device into the port tap a button or two to decide the quality ( .wav vs several mp3 sampling rates ) ... viola ! it records directly to your flash drive , ipod or external hard drive . if you do go that route , make sure you get the `` plus '' model . the older model is outdated and does n't work as well . 4 . use a pc . even though it will give you the best possible sound and options , it 's out of the question for me because i do not want to move my pc near my stereo every time i want to make a recording , nor do i want to move my stereo next to my pc ... or bog it down while i 'm trying to use it for that matter . keep in mind that if you record your cds using one of the stand alone decks , you can still clean up the hiss and pops by loading the cds you made into a pc afterwards , then filtering the files with your favorite audio software , then re-burn the files to cd or mp3 .
0	i have not been able to get this to work again . it was great for the first week , then it made my computer crash and now i can not get it installed again . i am not sure i like that
0	i bought this product to help cleaning the lense of my auto cd player . i tried it for at least 10 times , but no luck . wet clean the lense manually is the best way , but that will include getting the player out from the dash board
0	do not by this product . it has several issues . go to the forums on the linksys website and see for yourself . most people , myself included , have problems with the cable modem crashing and requiring a reset on a regular basis . this device also has firewall issues that cause problems with the wii and xbox360 . it 's spi firewall component is at fault and can not be disabled without turning off the entire firewall . even in the face of the number of users having problems linksys has never released a firmware update and it does n't appear that they will
0	i bought this last christmas for my three year old and five year old . thesound of the piano is a little off , but all in all the piano is nice for the price . the leg of the stool breaks very easily . do n't buy unless you can fix
0	it was a great product when it worked . sleek design , super user friendly , sharp image and easily unlock to all region . never had any problem loading or playing until last week . went completely dead for no reason in the middle of a movie . swallowed the dvd with it . it would 've been a greater product if it lived pass 1 year at least
1	i purchased the lj3390 to replace an existing lj3320 . the $ 350 rebate available until the end of oct was the deciding factor as it made the unit a very reasonable purchase . my main interest in the upgrade was to purchase a network connected printer . duplex print capability was the other factor that tipped the scale in favour of the lj3390 over the lj3052 . i now have 3 desktop and 2 laptop printers all printing successfully . all run xp sp2 and are either connected via a wired or wireless network connection . software installation went flawlessly . while i ca n't comment about hp versus other vendor software , i can say that the lj3390 software is a major improvement over that of my lj3320 . scanning is faster by at least a factor of 2x , quite likely more like 3-4x . printing of complex pages is also much faster , exactly what i would expect from a newer generation print engine and an hp laserjet printer . all in all i am very pleased that i upgraded . it has met all my upgrade goals . printing is faster , scanning is much faster . the network connectivity ensures anyone can print without another machine being forced to be a print server and constantly left on . i have n't played with the fax side yet , but am hoping this finally let 's me retire my trusty standalone fax machine .
0	you do n't have to spend a fortune on expensive cables when you are dealing with digital signals . keep in mind that all digital interfaces have error correction built into them . did you know the internal components of consumer electronics are connected with tin and nickel ? there 's no gold inside ! so there 's no need for oxygen-free , gold tipped , multi sheilded , super mega supreme cables . if you do n't believe me , buy this cable and a no-name cheapie . compare them for yourself -- you will see no difference . with analog signals , a good quality cable may make a difference ( although the difference is usually only visible on an oscilloscope ) .
0	it says it 's an a/v dock for video ipods but it only would transmit audio to my tv . i 'm really pissed about this product.what a waste ! a/v cables that sell for 20 $ are incredible . they sinply plug into the headphone jack of my 80 gig ipod and into the a/v inputs of my tv
0	amazon fail to deliver item within a reasonable time . the item fail to arrive and therefore we never received the good
1	not quite as bright a conventional flashlight , but certainly bright enough . no battery feature ca n't be beat . manufacturer claims it will stay on for a hour with a one minute wind . i 've never left mine on that long , but i 've only needed to wind it once in over a year . this is an excellent flashlight . i 've bought several
1	i love the sling media slingbox tuner ! the install was very easy just as they had said on the reviews . the quality of picture is just as good as on my cable tv . i have a great processor with the highest internet speed i could get though my cable so that may contribute to the good quality picture and color i get with it and may also be the reason i have had no problems with doing computer work and watching the screen at the same time . plue my shipment from amazon was in 2 days ! you rock amazon !
0	do not buy this if you own the c340 -- it does n't fit and amazon should n't market this as if it will . it 's a nightmare to have to get it returned and get a refund . this is also true for the cigarette lighter adapter -- i hope there will be clarity as to which accessories go with each model otherwise , you 'll be in for a lot of wasted time and money . the garmin is great , but the fact that most of their accessories are not compatible within the product family is a huge problem .
0	this product is great the only problem i have is that upon downloading the drivers for this item i get a warning from my server stating that this devise does not have an id certificate and it advises me not to use this item for it may damage my computer . i want to use this item but i am afraid to please verify you certificate so i can complete my downloa
0	i bought this hd because my lacie ( which had lasted over 5 years ) crashed on me finally . so i figured i would try a different company . out of the box this product looked great , although it was very large and heavy . i immediately plugged it in to test it and it came up - however that was the one and only time that it booted . i tried several more times and it would n't boot up . very very scary when you buy a new device to hold all you important data and it wo n't boot up out of the box . i do n't know if this product just happened to be the one that sucked - but i am not taking any chance on a defective hd and my data . going back to lacie
1	got 3 of them a few months ago , and buying another one now . excellent product , fits many different plug types . no flaws .
1	the product works fine . it seems kind of strange that i had to purchase a package of 10 in order to get just the 2 that i needed . the linksys unit is just attached to the bracket by pressure so i ran a long zip tie through the bracket and around the linksys units to make sure they did n't pop off
1	this xd memory card works perfectly with my camera fujifilm finepix f650 . good buy for the price
1	if your a serious gamer and want the best quality money can buy , like me , i would highly suggest this product . sounds are crystal clear , and fiber optics is the next step up in technology . my first question for you would be , `` how much do you invest in your gaming ? '' . once again , if your like me the answer is a lot . my next question would be `` how important is your audio experience ? '' you dont know what your missing out on until you actually experience the difference . very happy with this product
1	just a note to those who 've been having trouble opening these cases , without breaking them . if you use an emory board to slightly sand the top knob which is holding the case together , you 'll be able to open and close it ok. do n't sand too much , and just do the top knob , or it wo n't hold together . i like the fact that these cases are clear and fairly inexpensive , so i wanted to make them work . hope it works for you
0	7 out of the 25 disks would not write . i didnt much care for the product considering this factor .
1	if you want a budget home theater system for under $ 200 there is probably not many systems better then the sony ht-ddw700 . this system is ideal for small rooms such as a bed room or a tiny living room . considering the price , sound quality is actually better then expected for me . the tiny cube speakers presents pretty good clarity . they may look like cheap computer speakers but they are n't and are a bit heavier then they look . the center channel may be a little underpowered since dialog during dvd movies sound a tad soft and a little too low . the surround effects during movies in dolby digital and dts are very good though . if set up properly the speakers handle surround effects very well . some minor complaints is that the speaker wire attached to the speakers are very thin . they are fixed and ca n't be replaced . also , if you want heart stopping bass then this system might not be for you . the 8 '' subwoofer is okay considering the price of the system . it is currently better then any other sub included in a home theater system under $ 200 . it is n't powered , is very light ( only 9 lbs ) and you have to be pretty close to actually feel the bass . the volume would have to be cranked up extremely high for the sub to actually rattle your walls . the receiver comes with 1 optical and 1 coxial digital input and 4 rca analog inputs . it should be enough in most cases . an extra digtal input or two would n't hurt but again the system is under $ 200 . setup could n't be easier . you just hook up the included microphone , place it at your listening postion and press a button on the remote . the system will automatically sets up the speaker distance , delay and volume levels . the receiver comes with the basic pro logic ii music and move modes to upmix your stereo sources . it also has other sound fields and effects to enhace the sound but they do n't really seem to enhance the sound by that much if at all . basically , if you want a home theater system for a small room and for under $ 200 then there is n't much better then the sony ht-ddw70
1	i travel overseas a lot for my job . this little power strip is compact and enables you to keep one adapter on the end of it to plug into the funky wall plug and then use your `` normal '' plugs for operating four devices . most monster products are terribly overpriced and not worth the money ( wires , cables , etc . ) but this gizmo rocks
0	i own one of these , it came packaged in my dell xps renegade . sound in a windows environment is good , as indicated by other reviews . but in a gaming environment for example world of warcraft , and not just this game , i and other user 's have experienced the squeal of death , wherein the sound will become replaced with a high pitched squeal , and may hard lock your computer . either way this can only be corrected by rebooting . check out the forums before buying any creative labs products . buyer beware !
0	received my camera today ( 05/22 ) and all items are not in the box . i am missing hand strap , ni-mh batteries , battery charger and cradle adapter . worse part is i did receive a usb cable but it is not the right size and does n't fit . this is very frustrating . how do i get the missing items
0	works fine on windows xp , but does not work well with linux . i 've been using linux for at least 10 years and compiling my own kernels for most of that time , and still had issues getting this card to run under linux . my built in 10/100 nic was much faster than this card would go . ended up getting an intel gigabit card that , of course , works with no issues . save yourself some headaches and stay away from this card if it is destined for a linux box .
0	this product does not hold the smaller ipods well at all , only should be bought by people with the bigger model ipods .
0	soon parted ... . very disapointed , bad design , not for the gym which is what i bought them for.. sound is ok , not wonderful ... wish i would have read these reviews before i spent the $ 100 .
1	this is a great value for money and it is very silent and soen not get hot . it is also silent and convenient . it is more flexible with the fat 32 format it comes in but i preferred the ntfs file format whice is safer and more stable . it was no problem to reformat to ntfs
0	what a crock as it looks like everyone else got good product and good service ! i got a shuffle and something happened the second time i tried to load music to make it not even play . i took it to the apple store in mall of america ( minneapolis , mn ) and they claimed to know there was an issue and claimed to have fixxed it . i go back home ( ok ) and it still does not work . apple said for $ 113 they 'll fix . gee thanks ! i 'll be looking at another brand ! apple stinks
0	our company bought two of this model in 2005 for our new branch office . after we set them up , it works just fine . we did n't use any of the advanced features at that time . after reading the user 's guide and online forum at the linksys web site , we found out that there are a battery inside the router that is not user replaceable . you need to send it in for replacement . sure enough , we now have two routers that ca n't retain any configuration settings . they all reset to factary default all of a sudden , one after 1 year , the other after 1 and half year . also note , we updated one of the router to newest firmware , which prevents any kind of connection from the internet . needless to say , my boss is really crossed with me because i was the one recommend the model
0	does not work with non-apple base stations ! i had a powermac g5 . i was told by apple retail store clerks it will work any wireless g access points . but no ! at my house my pc can see no less than 6 wireless ap 's ( some from neighbors , one mine ) . but this airport card can only see one ( which is an apple airport station ) ! tried everything ( googled , set encryption modes , slow downed my linksys wap tranfering bitrate to 2mbps etc ... ) and no luck . returning it tomorrow
0	i recently bought my second of these . the first had a digital tuner . you had to get used to the feel . after about a year of use , one earphone went out . the one i just bought has an analogue tuner , and it is extremely hard to get any station other than the very high-powered pop ( and around here , country ) stations . the tuner requires extremely small movements to move way up the dial . i ca n't believe sony is charging $ 40.00 for this cheap piece of junk
1	this product work perfectly in the epson printer ! the quality of printing is great !
0	this device is much bulkier than it needs to be . but an even worse offence is that the device can not control the ipod . the ipod plugs in to the back , and you have to turn the unit around to reach the back to operate the ipod . it is the most ridiculous thing when you have turned off the power to the video unit ; then turn it around and find that the ipod is still playing and will continue playing forever unless you turn that off too
0	my first two black 15 cartridges worked pretty well in my hp deskjet 3820 then the third one started to indicate low fluid level and stopped printing . i replaced it with a new cartridges but it refused to work at all . while repeatingly trying to reinstall it as tech support suggested , the etch tore . when examing the inside of the printer , i found that black ink had splattered around inside the mechanism area indicating a leakage . the next new cartridge would not work either . $ $ wasted . tech support said to have the printer repaired -- ya sure ( after only one year of moderate home use and the warantee had ran out ) . printer repair would cost me more a new one
0	i bought one of these when i bought my macbook to keep it in pristine condition , just a few months ago . i just popped it off to clear out a little bit of debris that got caught between the cover and the macbook and find that all along the cover has been scratching my macbook . they should at least have had the foresight to make the plastic in contact with the macbook of a softer material , or created a design where it wo n't rub against the laptop . really stupid design . it may have protected against some very minor scratches , but likely i 'm worse off for using this cover ( scratches on the outside of the cover are more evenly dispersed than those now on the macbook but both are of similar severity ) . i do n't think in the long run it was worth $ 40 , and i feel very misled by the marketing for this cover . given the choice again i would have either gone for another brand or just saved my money
1	great product that works exactly as described . i have not used this as a stand-alone label maker ; i 've only used it with my computer . the software is fairly easy to use , and it will pull data from an excel spreadsheet , which is a definite plus . i had a spreadsheet of over 300 items for which i needed to make labels , and linking to the excel doc made the process very quick and convenient . the only complaint i have is that the tape for the label maker is rather pricey . i spent $ 40 on the label maker , and so far i 've spent $ 60 on tape
0	there is absolutley nothing wrong with the car charger . it works fine . however the fm transmitter has 2 problems for me . 1 -- the connector is not long enough to connect through many of the protective cases made for zune so you have to take it out of the case . 2 -- the signal is very weak and did not work for me in either of my cars . i ended up buyin a cassette adapter which worked much better and there was a 100 % better sound quality
1	i bought this mouse about three months ago , and i love it . it works on every surface , and the scroller works well too . the only complaint i have is that the cord is rather short ( about 2.5 feet long ) , and it plugs into the left-hand side of my laptop , which means that i only have about a foot to work with . although , i think that complaint can be shared equally with the dell people for putting the usb port on the left ( good deal for the left-handed population , i guess ) . some people have complained about the wind-up function for the cord getting tangled , but i have n't had any problems with that
0	the epson r2400 is a purely photo printer . be sure to understand this before you buy . so if you are planning to have one printer and think this is it . . . think again . the k3 inks are not compatible with plain paper and any documents you print on plain paper are horribly color shifted and distorted . it took three calls to epson and replacing the icc profile before they would finally admit that the problem was the k3 ink compatibility with the plain paper . all the magazines raved about the black and white printing quality . not . at least not on premium quality photo paper . perhaps in some of the more expensive matt papers . i saw very little improvement over my epson r320 . now if you are going to use it strictly for a photo printer then this is very nice printer . the biggest drawback is you will not find the ink cartridges at any major store such as staples . the in stock ink guarantee there does not apply to items not carried in the strore . this is hint # 1 . hint # 2 if you run out of ink on a weekend and need to have something for monday you are sol . the only option you have is to order the ink online . trust amazon as they can find and deliver . however if for some reason your lucky enough to have a large pro photo store near bye they may have the cartridges . cartridges certainly dont last very long and at $ 12- $ 15 each with eight of them your burning $ 100- $ 125 a set . bulk ink tanks are coming out but i doubt the k3 inks will be imitated . if you can stand ordering everything online and are only looking for a great photo printer than this may be just the ticket for you . however at $ 850 i fully expected to be able to print documents with pictures on plain paper . i have n't been happy with this printer and i plan to replace it soon . amazon 's being able to locate and ship the ink is the only reason its still here .
0	despite what the belkin folk told me over the phone , this does not work on a mac
1	this product worked very well , and was easy to hook up . for my use i had 3 video game systems using component video optical audio , and the switching was very quick . i replaced separate manual switchers for toslink component , and am happy with this product
0	i bought this receiver to use as a preamp in my system . i based my decision on information as stated on the pioneer web site , and the attractive price compared to some of the other options i considered . this receiver does have a number of good features , but has one serious flaw . it will not display on screen status messages for daily operations , like volume and sound mode , unless you have a pioneer display , and run another special cable from the receiver to the tv ( as a side note , pioneer needs to understand we want to run less cables to our display ) . that means you only get to see the simple set-up screen on your non-pioneer tv , which you will probably use when you first set up the receiver , and very infrequently after that . ( the set-up menu lets you set things like assignable inputs , and audio calibtraion . ) sounds like a small deal , but in many home theaters , including mine , the electronics are not in the line of site ( mine are in a closet just outside the theater with an infrared repeater system controlling everything . ) this not uncommon , many have thier electronics isolated like me or behind cabninet doors , and it means i have no idea what the volume is , what sound mode i am using , or anything beyond the set-up menu unless i go into the closet . bad , bad , bad ! this seems to be a marketing ploy by pioneer to get you to buy pioneer tv 's and projectors , and it is beyond stupid . if this was not the case i would rate this receiver much higher , but it is a serious flaw . it makes using this unit extremely tedious and difficult . this limitation also means , if you have mulitple displays , i have a plasma tv and projector in my theater , you need to run thier special cable to both displays , and both have to be pioneer . again , i have to say bad , bad , bad ! the other features are as stated on the pioneer website , but they are lying when they say this unit has on screen display , and this will be a major drawback for users that do not have the receiver in the line of site when using thier systems , unless they have a pioneer display with sr+ . ( oh yeah , your pioneer display has to be also be equipped with sr+ , thier way of linking the two units . if your pioneer display is not equipped with sr+ , you are again out of luck . did i mention this is bad ? ! ) 25 feb 2007 - addition to reveiw : i called onecall and they will take unit back , but at 15 % restocking fee , plus paying for shipping both ways . while onecall really did nothing wrong ( pioneer is lying about the osd ! ) , it is one of thier vendors and not the customer 's fault either and the customer should not pay for this kind of fraud . buyer beware from onecall , thier customer service on this one was not good
0	i purchased this cable and the pins were weak and clumsy . i could not even plug it in and one of the pins broke . i threw it away . it is a piece of junk
0	i know that everyone else seems to love this , so perhaps my complaint is more about apple in general . my ipod mini ( pink ) is a lemon . the battery has never worked properly . it takes longer to charge than to discharge , and my current playing time per charge ( no changing settings , not backlighting , nothing but hitting play and waiting till the battery dies ) is about 2 hours . apple will gladly sell me a new ( $ 70 ) battery , but other than that tough . it is apparently my fault thet they 're selling shoddy products . i 'm not saying do n't buy it . there are n't realistically any better choices out there than the ipod , but buy it when you have a week to sit around and evaluate it and when they get around to opening a store near you . as for me , i think i 'm going to dig out my old discman
0	the buttons do n't have that clicky button feel , so you press and you 're like `` did it go ? '' ... the labels are hard to read , icons take a little figuring out . honestly i use it for turning on/off , and if i want to do anything else i go up to the ihome to adjust it .
1	i have bought this for about 8pp in my office for their black and white desktop printer . so far not one problem . the toner is long-lasting and affordable . great quality- small desktop footprint . does a great job with envelopes , labels and even light cardstock . i would highly reccommend to anyone
1	i just purchased this item two days ago ( thurs . ) today ( sat . ) i removed my 160gb seagate hhd from my kingwin enclosure and installed it in this one . installation was not a problem although the molex connector seems to be a tight fit and is almost touching the fan . fan noise does not seem to be a problem yet . i used the firewire connection instead of usb and the drive access is much faster than it was with the usb connection on the other enclosure . the price is a little steep compared to others but i got a generous rebate offer with my purchase . although the case is plastic ( my other one was aluminum and plastic ) i wo n't be moving mine around so that wo n't be an issue
1	i , like many other people that have written reviews here , researched the purchase of an mp3 player in great detail . other members of my family own ipods , and that is the direction that i was heading until i did a massive amount of research . if you want to rip the thousands of songs that you already own on cd , this is the unit that you want . ipod will not let you download your own songs , i did not know that until after i purchased this player ( thankfully ) . this unit was the highest rated unit by far that i was able to scour the internet for . if this is your first purchase of an mp3 player ( like mine ) buy this one , no questions asked . do not worry about trying to buy $ 80 ear buds the sound from the ear buds that come with the player is unreal . crisp , clear , awsome base and i have only turned up the player to 23 on the volume it goes up to 40 . i can not hear the home stereo that my wife is listening to or my kids that are running around the house playing . i received this player in the mail today at 5:30 when i got home from work and by 6:35 i have transfered the 114 artists folders ( about 4,000+ songs ) that i had ripped on my computer last week ( about 35 to 40 minutes to transfer the music to the staging folder and then to the player ) . i would recomend buying the cradle , it helps in standing it up on the desk or over the stereo , which i plan to do to play all my music on my outdoor speakers by the pool . absolutley buy this unit . i have only messed wit it for a couple of hours and i have a high performance expectation and it has met it
1	within about 12 seconds of opening the box i was listening to my ipod on my home stereo . wires are well made . there may be cheaper options that work as well but these will last forever
1	this is about the only mouse i buy , have gone through a couple of them in the past few years . i just ca n't see spending alot of money on something thats going to naturally wear out . this model is one that i find comfortable for the hand and durable in the using . if you want a good , reliable , comfortable mouse , this logitech is a good choice
0	i was expecting at least a degree worth of difference , it did not help at all ! absolute waste of 50 dollars
1	speakers give good sound quality and are small and unnoticeable at a good price all the things i was looking for in speake
0	easy to set up and worked great for 2 months then it just stopped working . horrible customer service ! will never buy from this company again !
1	i ordered this for my teenage daughter for christmas and she loves it . the sound is great and the amplifier works well . for the price it plays like a much more expensive instrument . i recommend this to any new player wanting to learn the guitar
1	i gave this 5 stars only because it serves its purpose well . it 's just a basic mouse pad , but the price is excellent ! !
0	i have had a canon g2 since 2002 . i used to use viking 128 mb cf cards and had no problem . in october 2004 , i bought one viking cf512m 512mb cf card from amazon . i did not use it until this summer . after i had taken 20 more photos and reviewed , i immediately found a few images corrupted . no matter how i tried , e.g . format the cf before use , there were alway corrupted images . i wonder if i can return the defect cf card and get a replacement from amazon or from manufacturer ? sherwood l.a. count
0	this home theater package , despite being attractively priced considering its apparent functionality , is ultimately very disappointing . i 'm new to hdtv and hdmi so i did n't know as much as i needed in order to make a fully informed decision . i have a sony bravia xbr3 , oppo upconverting dvd player , scientific atlanta hd box and nintendo wii game console . this unit only offers pass-through video , so you have to have separate video connections from the receiver to the tv for each type of input ( hdmi , component , etc. ) . for the price difference between this and other receivers that will convert to a single connection , you 'll pay in extra cabling costs . the hdmi on this unit carries video only - no sound - so you have to have separate cabling to carry audio from your dvd or cable to the receiver , and then from the receiver to your tv . again , major inconvenience and lots of additional connections . the manual for this unit is beyond terrible . i 'm astounded that an international consumer electronics firm like sony would provide a manual as difficult to use and just indirect as this one . for example , there was a hum when watching tv that turned out was because the speakers while looking identical are not - some are shielded and some are n't . nothing in the manual about this . there are probably just enough hdmi and component connections for the basic user like myself . plus side is that there is no dvd player with this , so i can use my own . given a chance to do this again , i would spend a little extra on a unit that converts signals to a single output
1	good price . just not sure it is needed
1	i read some of the reviews about installation issues and they concerned me initially . but , when it came time to get the printer up and running on my wireless network , there really were n't any issues . just following the directions ( and avoiding the easysecure option ) worked fine . i would highly recommend this printer-the quality of the printing is excellent , the feature/function set is quite high for a moderate price , and it 's a great home/office printer that has lots to offer .
1	you really ca n't go wrong with this one . not great response but what do you expect for less than $ 300 ? on the other hand , the possibilities for this surround system are endless . want something just for the effects to complilment your bedroom wide screen ? how about using it for a dedicated gaming sound system , ( this is how my daughter has it configured ) . it 's our second one . first one died as a result of recent electrical storm , ( yes the circuit was 'protected ' , but so what ) . could n't be happier for the investment
1	i looked at all the different cases for my new ipod with video , and the reviews kept pointing me back to this case . so i bought it . it exceeds my expectations . it 's fantastic . my ipod is now completely contained and scratchproof . this helps when down the road i might want to sell it . the screen cover is perfectly clear and seems very durable . i like the fact that it 's held off of the ipod 's screen so it wo n't scratch . the clickwheel is easily usable , actually more so because of the circle around it . i bought the case on amazon from sonicswap and am astounded at how fast i got it . 2 days ! amazing . this case is for the 60gb ipod with video . it clearly says that in the title ; not sure how that one reviewer got confused about that . do n't hesitate . this is the case
0	very poor design..would never recommend this product . the connection is so flaky , you will end up wasting lot of time
1	i bought a zen 30g mp3 player and could not stand the earbuds they came with . they hurt so much that i used head phones until these v-moda earbuds came in . they are awesome . the fit is so comfortable and the sound it wonderful . i got them on sale for less than they are running right now on amazon , so i feel pretty good about the purchase . =
0	syntax clearly states that their warranty is only good for the origninal purchaser . i got my daughter one as a gift , gave it to her bran new , in the factory sealed box and syntax refuses to honor the warranty , ( and yes i calld everywere and tried everything ) .
1	this is my first experience with hdtv and wide screen . this 46 '' sony tv is excellent with hd programs ; with regular broadcasts , it is a bit muddy , but that is the fault of the signal , not the tv . i am very pleased with the overall quality of the set . i had the set professionally installed and set up , and i am sure glad i did : install and set up are not for amateurs like me ; if anything ever happens , i will be hard pressed to reset things . sony 's instruction manuals are not that great
0	i purchased the md781 + md71 expansion phone after briefly having its predecessor the md681 . i really like the md681 but i could never locate one of its expansion handsets ( everyone online/offline was constantly out of stock ) . overall i 'm disappointed with this new model and after two weeks of use i am already looking for another phone . handheld phones : i like them more than any other phone i 've tried . unlike most phones these days they 're big and have a very solid feel to them ... it 's just easier to hold onto a phone like this for a longer conversation . the buttons are a nice size and easy to use . the hands free/speak phone on the handheld works well . with one person on a handheld line the sound is pretty good , but with two people on handsets you get significant background noise that is so bad it hurts your ear and it 's hard to hear the person on the other end of the conversation . the shared phonebook is a terrific idea but it could have been done better . it 's a few clicks and slow to access ... almost as quick to have the old rolodex on hand ... or copy the number to the local units phonebook ... which defeats the purpose . as for the answer machine : once you play messages you no longer have a visible indicator of how many messages , if any , are in the system ( is it just me or is that poor design ) , so if you listen to messages when you partner is n't around you need to leave a note for them to check messages . the quality of voice messages is a bit grainy . i also like how the handset docked in the older m681 ; it laid on the base so you had the option of wall mounting the base ... the md781 sits up on the base like some sort of obelisk .
1	i installed this antenna in my pawn shop where we keep most of our electronics running all day . i could never get good reception with standard antennas and now this single antenna does the job better than any i have ever seen . keep in mind that i have a full surveillance systen , alarm syster , phone system , 20 home stereos , a dozen or more computers and on and on . the terk fm-50 has exceeded my expectations . thanks , joel dba pawn-plus
0	pros : cheap cons : bad video quality . moving diagonal lines are clearly visible
0	i loved this phone , but after only a few weeks the button is stuck and the phone ca n't pick up . i want it fixed but do n't know how
0	i bought the ear buds to replace the ones that came with my ipod . i used it for about fifteen minutes and then the left earbud would not transmit any sound . sending these ones back . i must say that the earbuds kept outside sound out very well ( much to my mom 's dismay , she could n't fuss at me : -p ) . oh well .
0	terrible user interface - you must page through tons of cryptic menus to set basic features . pulls multiple papers through , so you must start again . is a g3 , which you would think would be compatible with earlier non-g3 fax machines - wrong - so you ca n't fax to 75 % of the community that has a non g3 unit ! i thought i was buying quality from canon when i paid $ 250 for this hunk of junk ! the cheap brother and hp 's at my work never have these problems and are easier to use , and much less expensive . save your money and save the headaches ! sorry canon , this product was a disaster
1	i am very pleased with the brother p-tough ql-500 . the printing lables are a good price for the quantity you get .
0	i 've had my micro for over a year now , and when it worked , i loved it ! however , i 'm having the notorious ear phone jack issue ; the sound is output in layers , and i am constantly trying to `` reposition '' my headphones to get full sound . my husband called creative labs for assistance , and he was told that it would cost him [ ... ] per month for a `` customer service subscription . '' after reading these reviews , it seems we 'd be paying creative labs [ ... ] so that they could tell us there 's nothing they can ( or will ) do . next brand , please ...
1	the only thing i do n't like about it , is the scanning area is upside down where most scanners you open the lid and put your photo or document close to you this scanner you have to put it all the way to the back of the scanner so you have to open the lid all the way . also the film tray shows on some of my documents as well you would think they would give you something to cover the film tray when not in use . i did like the way xp found this scanner right away with no disks or software . i have a cannon scanner i just got a few months ago but it is limited because it is not compatible with xp with out cannons software , the cannon was so bad that i purchased this one all in all i like it does a great job glad they still make just scanners for people who use laser printers
1	this card , using via 's superb envy24 ht chipset , is a huge improvement over my realtek and via envy24ht-s based cards . everything sounds better . my old audigy 2 platinum ( which i think i shall melt ) did better in 3d games , but only slightly . since this card does n't snap , crackle , and pop like the creative cards do , i 'll venture to say that it actually does make games better , since there are no weird noises distracting from the feel of the game . pros : * very high audio sampling rates , allowing for incredibly good audio production ; warm , rich , warm bass all the way up to crystal clear highs . * no crackling , popping , or hissing ! a real joy after pulling my hair out for years trying to figure out why creative labs cards keep doing this . * well-maintained , solid drivers . * supports eax 2.0 * excellent asio support . cons : * no hardware support for directsound ; however , if your machine is faster than about 1ghz , you probably wo n't notice the difference . benchmark your results on a machine made in the last three years and you 'll find that no hardware directsound acceleration amounts to *less* than a 1 % difference in speed . * only supports up to eax 2.0 , due to creative labs refusing to license the technology . sound difference is minimal , though
0	i 'm usually a big linksys supporter . this is an exception . this device is a joke . not a very funny one . the first thing i was told when i called for support was it most likely would n't work with my printer ( canon mp950 ) . i spent several hours trying to get a linksys router to see this thing with online support . do n't waste your time
1	radio reception in my apartment is terrible . i have purchased a few indoor antennas , even a different terk model , but none of them helped very much . i had to move the antenna around to different areas for different stations , and my digital fm radio only received one digital channel . this unit , however , works great . i get every station i want , and the digital fm works great . the only thing i would mention is that the antenna casing is bulky , so if you 're concerned about asthetics you 'll have to figure out where you can conceal it . also , i did n't get any additional benefit from the amplifier , but the antenna worked so well that i did n't need it
0	i lovelovelove dark chocolate , ( and other strong , pungent things like goat cheese and dark beer ) but these taste just plain wierd . it 's not terrible , but i can taste the hoodia , sorta like dried grass mixed in with the chocolate . i think they work at reducing hunger , but they give me gas so bad i ca n't be sure if i want to eat less because of the hoodia , or the gas . maybe i 'll try the *regular* chocoleans , but i wo n't be buying this again . fyi : i absolutely love the phytobase powdered chocolate hoodia shake mix . i have no problems with that . tastes great , works great . and no gas !
1	after looking into several reviews on blow dryers , i learned about the revlon tourmaline . all of the reviews were so positive . i 've been suprised at how light the dryer is and how easy the controls are . the placement could n't be better on the controls . the price was right as well ! blow dryers in this class are generally much more expensive . a very good value
1	i 've tried many types of nutrition bars and many are too sweet or they are not tasty . clif bars get it right
1	heats up fast , rolls up easily ( does n't slip like old-school hot rollers used to ) , and stays on with the right hot roller clips . depending on the look i 'm looking for , i use 4 or up to 8 rollers for my chin-length fine hair , keep them on for 10 minutes while i put on my makeup , and voila ! soft , strokeable voluminous hair
1	i have a braun 8995 shaver which is fairly good but upon reading the reviews i just had to try out the panasonic and i am v impressed . dry it shaves v slightly closer than the braun but with just a splash of water and a dab of king of shaves gel the result is amazing and quite quick too , a v close shave in about 2 minutes . i keep stroking my face to feel the smoothness . i dont use the cleaning station , i just rinse it under the tap so the only ongoing cost will be the foil and cutters but with the results i am getting i am well pleased
0	though not advertised to humidify a large room , i found it incapable of making any significant difference in even a small room . i tested it , in a roughly 1000 cubic foot room , by placing a relative humidity sensor in the middle of the room , and after 2 hours not even a 1 % increase in humidity ! fortunately , i was able to receive a full refund
0	this is the second one of these i 've owned ... my first one the screen went blank after about a month and a half ... not an uncommon problem with this , i can see reading the other reviews ... but i thought maybe it was just a problem with that particular pedometer , so i bought a second one ... big mistake ! as far as the radio , what a piece of crap . i live about 20 minuters ' drive from downtown houston ... maybe there are too many radio stations around here . it just wo n't lock on to anything , not even the strongest stations . tons of static and stations fading in and out . i bought a pedometer with a radio because i wanted a radio while i walked . if you 're selling a pedometer with a radio , the radio should work . i would give this 0 stars if i could
0	would have been better if i actually got this.. i ordered this and got 6 dr. bronner 's lavender soap with a hemp tree soap bar code on the back . i 'm too lazy to send back and i already opened one and the lavender is nice . but i would rather have the hemp tree ... afraid to order again
0	it does let you shake and mix up the protein well . but no matter how tightly you screw the cap on liquid gets all around the edge and in the threads . then as soon as you put it down it all runs down the sides and leaks everywhere . it 's a horribly cheap and leaky design . i would look elsewhere or just be prepared with a lot of paper towels every time you use it . ( and if you find a good one that does n't leak please post the info here and let me know ) . thanks
0	this product states 4 toothbrushes . that is incorrect , it only holds 3 . this product also states 4 aa batteries or ac adapter . that is also incorrect . you can not use 4 aa . i felt that was misleading and unfortunately unless to me . if those things do n't bother you , it might be what you are looking for , but since it does bother me , i never even tried it
0	i know that this product works for some , but for me it did not . that is why i decided to return it . wahl makes great products , but this product was not for me . my skin was too sensitive and the machine irritated it .
1	tis is the best joint supplement i have found on the market . thank you amazon for carrying it
1	nizoral anti-dandruff shampoo seems to be a very good product . i noticed a difference the first time i used it -- there was no residue on my scalp , and my flakiness was greatly reduced . it produced a very rich lather , also . the only thing i did n't like about it was the possibility that i 'd have an allergic reaction to the ingredients , but the instructions did n't tell which ingredients might make this happen . i , myself , am sensitive to many products , and did n't have any reaction to the ingredients of the shampoo . i would recommend this product to others
1	i originally ordered a tanita scale and it stopped working within two weeks . ( amazon , of course , took it back with no problems . ) i was so glad when the omron scale arrived . it costs less than the tanita but the quality is much higher . the numbers on it are very large and easy to read . also , it is much easier to place your feet properly than on the tanita . i ca n't wait to try all the features . by the way , i weighed myself over and over and my weight only varied .2 lbs . as promised . great deal for the money ! ! !
1	i bought this to try it out based on a friend 's recommendation . previously i 'd always packed a couple old ratty towels with the dog 's stuff before heading to the lake or the beach . now i only need one towel and it dries like you 'd never believe . i have a 65 pound dog that loves the water . i make him shake the water off himself ( a trick as important as sit or lay down when you have a dog this big ) then i towel him dry in less than a minute . i now own 3 of these towels and have purchased them for just about anyone i know with a dog that gets wet . we live in seattle so not only are we surrounded by lakes other bodies of water , but we have rainy winters . having one of these towels hanging behind the door with the coats was a god send this winter as well . i ca n't speak enough praise about this towel . though a $ 30 pricetag for a meer towel could seem daunting , believe me when i tell you this is worth it . you 'll end up buying two
1	i love these bars . i 've tried all the flavors and they 're all pretty darned great . i eat them more for a snack than a meal because they are n't as filling as i 'd like , but they 're great for a snack or sugar craving
0	i 'm a huge fan of the pria line , but these are not like the others - they are heavier and a little grainy . i do n't hate them , but will not buy them again . the flavor is pretty good though , just not what i was expecting . i highly recommend the pria 110 calorie line - the vanilla is my favorite but the peanut butter and others are close behind . thank
1	hi , i 'm not a `` review '' person , but when i read the existing reviews , i felt like doing this . i used this product for 2 months and i must tell you that it really works ! i 'm hispanic-black woman ( dominican ) with relaxed fine hair and my hair grows normally , but only neck-chin lenght , no further than that . with this product i achieved a maximum growth rate and now my hair is leaving behind the accustomed lenght . i bought again the product to see how longer it can grows ! ! ! i 've been completely sincere with you ... i 'm not a staffer of this product company , i 'm a real and very happy user ! ! ! hope this comment will be helpful for other women . i have only one last thing to say : try it ! ! ! ! it worked for me..
1	it works very well . i bought it for my wives calves . she has thick ones and after working out it become more thick . using this product , her calves become soft and getting thin . i 've used it too , i can relax with it because it helps the blood circulation .
1	i love that stuff ! and now you have n't had it - but i need more - please make it available again . thanks
0	the pedometer arrive held prisoner in a difficult-to-open plastic cell -- what are these `` packaging engineers '' thinking ? it took me ten minutes and two ruined fingernails to open it , and then i took the scissors to it , and the hard packaging almost broke them ! but i was thrilled . a handsome object , thought i , and i loved the clip in the back that you pinch to open . so much better than having to wrestle it down over a soft waistband . i yanked out the plastic battery protector and set to work to rev the thing up to speed . but , alas , it would not follow instructions as they were written . `` press and hold the set button . hour display blinking . '' ( could they not have said , `` the hour display will blink '' ? i pressed . `` press memory button to adjust the hour . '' i did . the memory button never did a thing . so i asked a friend of mine to try and he had no luck either . we both tried several combinations of maneuvers , but nothing worked . to this moment , the hour display is blinking , blinking , blinking . i 'd like to get my money back , but ya know what ? j r music computer world in ny demand such a rigamarole to send it back , including with all the original packaging ( i threw the op in the trash ) , that you almost have to be a genius in packaging to follow their instructions , which , of course , are not designed to benefit the consumer but to benefit only themselves . now i 'm afraid this pedometer will follow its packaging into the trash , while i will make sure i never order from j again .
0	i am a male . i did a search and this item showed up for men . however , it is way too long for a man unless he is yao ming . it looked like i was wearing a skirt and came down several inches below my knees . i am 5'10 '' tall . also the light wieght microfiber terry was a drawback . it clings to you and builds up a lot of static electricity . i will not ever buy another product made of this material
1	we purchased eight of these ( 6 - 3/4 in . and 2 - 1 in . ) for our beauty salon in 1994 , and we 've never used another brand since . with their quick heat-up time and multi-level heat options , these irons perform superbly for precision curls . i was so pleased their performance that i bought one to use at home to replace my fancy vidal sassoon gold barrel , which only had two heat settings - too hot and burnt scalp . the heating element is so efficient that level 1 or 2 is probably sufficient for most home users . rarely did i have to set the iron at level 4 or 5 , and never above 5 . it takes less than a minute for the iron to heat up . four of the six irons we originally purchased lasted through 3+ years of constant professional use . at the price we paid , our weekly cost averaged out to pennies . if you purchase this product you will -not- be disappointed
1	best hair dryer ever . i have long , thick , curly , frizzy hair and after just drying my hair for less then 10 minutes with the conair 213x , my hair is shiny and soft . the diffuser is also amazing ; i can wear my hair naturally without any frizz . by far the best dryer out there in this price range . granted , it 's heavy , but it cuts my drying time in half and i do n't have to style after drying which is another plus ! it has a warm heat setting which is awesome and what could make it prettier than the rhinestones ?
0	i was very disappointed in this dryer and am returning it . it is very heavy and i am not a weakling ! it is also very big . with my arm stretched out all the way i can barely get it to my head . because it is so heavy and big i have 'banged ' myself on the head with the 'fingers ' . just things to consider when deciding whether to buy this dryer .
1	what a sinfully awsome tasting way to get rid of chapped lips
1	i have tried many brands of soy shakes , and this one is delicious.. i sure recomend it to anyone that wants to start the healthy habit of drinking soy . cookies cream flavor tastes like a real shake ! ! i really enjoy this drinks
1	my kids love this it fades right into the next color they fall right to sleep watching it change its an awesome light i was very pleased and its not to bright like some light up the room its just perfect mom of a 3 and 5 yr old ! !
1	the toothbrush section an the local drug store has at least a hundred different tooth brushes on offer but in spite of all this variety almost all of these have large heads . if you mouth is more petite or you have a strong gag reflex , your teeth suffer . the oral b head is small and although you have to work a little more on each tooth , you can . i have not had a cavity in years . my pearly whites look greate and my gums are firm an buffed . if only these woked on abs .
0	i bought this heating pad about a month ago and it did not get near as hot as i would like ! it is so hard to find a good heating pad now , but i would not reccomend this one
0	this item is rubbish ... it leaks , quite dangerous since water and electricity do n't mix . i got it , plugged it in filled it 3/4 full and had to stop cause water was all over my floor . i have already packed it up and will return it asap
1	this is one of those products i 'd put on my `` must have '' list if i had an elderly parent who could n't handle a vaccumm and had some area rugs or runners near the front door or entrance to any room . for daily touch-ups , these things ca n't be beat . they are extremely light and get all the stuff that gets dragged into the house between deep vacuuming . of course , i really believe that a doormat at the front door will go a long way in keeping out a lot of the dust and debris . for the stuff that gets by that , use the carpet flick . i tend to shake out my runners and deep vaccum them regularly but i 've noticed that some people who are elderly do n't have the strength for that . because i help out taking care of two people over 90 , this has been a great help to them in maintaining their independence and ability to keep things clean when i 'm not around ... and i 'm all for helping people to help themselves stay functional !
0	these 'cartridges ' sell for about $ 2 a piece , plus shipping . i recently switched from the mach 3 turbo to a merkur double edge safety razor and i can safely say i will never go back . the mach 3 provides a decent enough shave ( much better than an electric , in my experience ) but the single blade is actually much smoother . i pay about 50 cents a blade now with the safety razor - each blade lasts a little over a week - versus the mach 3 at $ 1.50- $ 2.00 lasting 6 or 7 days
0	i found this item to be equal to the conair curling iron you can buy in a drug store for less money
1	it doesnt quit dark circles , but helps against wrinkles while it is on your face
1	i bought one of these 'gizmos ' as a gift 3 years ago and i was so happy to find it on here ! ! it is like going to a salon and getting the best shampoo ever !
0	i was attempting to order aveda brilliant anti-humectant pomade , but received aveda brilliant humectant pomade . the packaging is so similiar . did not realize until i opened product that i had the wrong item . either you sent the wrong item or i inadverantly ordered the wrong one because of packaging . i was being very careful to follow every word ... so i wonder . ... does aveda srill make the anti-humectant pomade . i am stuck with the wrong item now that i opened the jar . at any rate , i am not a happy customer with a product that will not meet my needs plus i am minus the $ 22.53 amount spent
1	over the past two years i have been using several different green food products to try to find one that has a reasonable taste and seems to satisfy my physical needs . at age 70 those needs are many . after approximately two rounds of trying , it is miracle greens that has been most consistant in good taste and at the same time satisfying many of the needs i have for feeling better in general
1	i appreciate the gentle , yet powerful cleaning of all free clear allergen detergent . i have an infant find this cleans her clothes ours well without leaving any harsh irritants , so it 's easier to do the family 's laundry all together
1	the ultrasonic aromatheropy fountain is really unique . the sound generated , yet unheard , causes water to spring up from the surface 3-4 inches to provide a fountain-like water sound . at the same time , the frequency of the sound waves create a plesant cool misty fog that slowly boils over the sides and out along the surface it is sitting on . all the while , led lights under the water slowly change seemingly to all colors . the construction was just a little light duty other than that , very nice
1	i have a few minor quibbles with this razor , but it gives you a nice close , comfortable shave . and is n't that what we want in the end ? i do n't know anyone who buys one of these things for its `` ergonomic design features . '' it holds the charge for a good long time , and shaves your face nice . rinse it clean with running water and you 're done . that 's what i 'm looking for . the only things keeping me from a 5 star review is i 'm not yet comfortable with how the razor sounds when running . it seems like it 's always needing a charge ... but that 's how it sounds at full charge . it will take some getting used to i guess..others might find the quiet running mode a plus . also , the monthly cleaning of the cutters/combs is a bit complicated .
1	my daughter morgane , who is now 8 years old , has been suffering from delibitating migraines since infancy ( yes , there is such a thing , unfortunately ) . the symptoms are very impressive , she usually drops to the floor and starts vomiting within a few minutes . she can not move or open her eyes . it makes her very anxious and we noticed that she hyperventilates when she thinks she is going to `` get dizzy '' . we tried to make her breathe slowly and calm down , to no avail . morgane 's doctor told us that breathing slowly and practicing biofeedback were the best non-drug practices against migraines , and we try to avoid giving morgane medication as she is so young . so i thought of using resperate as my dad has high-blood pressure and i knew it worked on the breathing pattern . morgane immediately understood how to use the device , it was so easy and even fun for her . it relaxes her and gives her the strength to know she can do something about her migraines . her breathing pattern has reduced considerably and so far , she has not had another migraine attack for about 6 months . she used to have them every two months . i have purchased another device for my best friend , a long time migraine sufferer . the way i see it , it is such a painful condition that anything that helps without harm is a blessing
1	it is really good enough for my need . i have no problems so far
1	i just got my first case of this fabric softener last week and yesterday , i was walking downstairs when the smell of lavender hit me - i was surprised because i had n't sprayed any lavender freshener in the air , when i realized that my boyfriend was doing a load of laundry . like seventh generation 's lavender laundry detergent , i love this product - if you use them in tandem , not only do your clothes smell like *real* lavender ( not the chemically-based smells of mainstream products ) , but they come out clean and soft . i especially like the lavender smell for my sheets and blankets and it 's gentle enough to use on my baby 's clothes , too ! i love that it 's made with natural products and real lavender essential oil . it 's also safe for my septic system , so i 'm sold on this product . if you 're sensitive to the chemical-based scents of the mainstream fabric softeners or ca n't find one that smells good to you , try this one !
0	beware ! this thing , even if you try to be careful to be light on the pressure , as well as not keep it in one spot , it took the top layer of skin off ! my poor legs were in pain from my jeans rubbing up against them at work . ow ! i had to wrap them up in long cloth bandages till the skin healed . and what 's worse , it did n't take out all the hair ... . i could still see some hair here and there it missed , and i thought i got it all . i returned it immediately and got a refund on my money . never again ... . i 'll stick to my good ol ' electric razor instead ... .
1	i am 100 % satisfied with this product and it has already earned me what i paid for . i am able to trim my front portion of hair with this on my own , where as for a complete trim , i do need my wife 's assistance . if you trim on a regular basis , ie. , when the hair 's not over grown , you will definitely find the job more easier.i recommend it to everyone who wants to save on their haircuts . the price is a good deal too if you buy from amazon , else one may perhaps ahve to wait for the thanks giving sale
0	this thing comes with lots of attachments , of which i regularly used only 2 . the vibrating cuticle pusher is silly . as far as all those round discs , it 's hard to explain the physics of this , but suffice it to say that since it 's a rotating circle , you can only use half of it at a time or you 'll experience a bump-bump-bump . the thing rotates at such a speed ( even the lowest of the two speeds ) that even leaving on your toe or finger for a moment or two can create a burning sensation . what i did use was the smallest pointed attachment , which i used to lightly go around my nail close to the cuticle . this was good for when you 're wearing clear nail polish and your nails are starting to grow out . you can lightly buff down that ridge of polish . same goes for the edge where acrylic meets the natural nail . the other attachment i used , though less frequently , is the bigger cone-shaped one ( kind of looks like the shape of a foam ear plug ) . that i used to lightly go over my largest toenails to thin them down since i have trouble with ingrown toenails . again , it 's a challenge not to create burn when doing so . the nail dryer thing is silly and useless . if you manage to cram your hand into that little scoop without smudging the polish , it does n't do much anyway to dry your nails any faster than just letting them set . buy a little fan like they use in the shops if you want faster drying time . this thing is n't gon na do it . other folks mentioned this thing ruined their nails . it 's likely because they tried to use all of the attachments ( which you 'd think you should be able to do , right ? ) . much regular buffing on your nail thins it down and weakens it too much . the bump-bump-bump of the round attachments likely does n't help , either . a couple times i used this for acrylic nails . i have a tendency to wear acrylic nails a few weeks and then hate them and want them removed -- -and i 'm no longer willing to subject myself to the soak-and-pry method done in the nail salons . so the alternative was soak at home , or just trim down myself and then thin them to a more natural curved shape until the rest of the acrylic grew out . however , i mention i did this only a couple times . that 's because apparently acrylics are a bit too much of a challenge for this little `` deluxe manicure system . '' after sounding like it was ailing while it filed down the length of 2 acrylic nails , it gave a little bzz and then died . i waited a while to see if maybe it overheated . i tried other outlets . nope , dead . so i 'd pronounce this unfit for natural or acrylic nails . if you want something of quality for acrylic nails , invest in the dremel tools that the salons use ( just be sure to get one with a low rpm or foot pedal attachment ) . if you want something of quality for natural nails , go to the drug store and get some sandpaper nail files , a rectangular buffer , and a cuticle pusher . sometimes the best solution is the simplest .
1	my baby is 12 moth now and she uses the pampers cruisers ( size 3 ) from 4-month-old . it is soft and my baby never have `` rush '' with it . my whole family love this diapers .
1	i love this toothbrush , its easy and it really imporoves your gum health
0	i bought this product thrilled with the thought that i could use an epilator in the shower . even though that 's possible , the very last thing this product does is remove hair -- at least with the epilator head . the shaving head works fairly well , but a simple shaver would cost a lot less and shave as well or better . i ca n't believe panasonic thinks they 'll actually keep customers selling something this ineffective
1	i got this bed topper a couple weeks ago to place on my older matress . it was pretty pungent , but it felt so good the first time i layed in it . after a couple days it appeared to lose it 's memory and start to dent and crease , but eventually it got back to full expansion . the customer service with this item was fantastic ! we 'll see how long the matress keeps up its memory
0	i have been trying to suppress my appetite for awhile . i took trimspa 32 and i think that it did better than this product . i have been taking it for a week , and along with that , i have been substituting a nutrition shake for breakfast and a salad for lunch , plus working out . dinners are healthy about 5 days out of the week . i 've noticed no change . i am taking these to be able to eat significantly less and still work out . i 'm very hungry before lunch and when i get home i have to take a nap and ca n't work out until later in the evening . i really have noticed no change at all in my appetite or my energy level , which is really unfortunate
0	it ran good and i liked the different attachments , but i gave it away because i was uncomfortable with not having a lid like my previous one did
1	first of all i am in my early 20 's so i have n't much experience in night creams . i just more recently took an interest in moisturizers and eye creams after i decided to quit tanning and rather preserve my youthfulness . i use `` moisture therapy cream '' by olay in the morning before i put on my makeup , and then i use this at night . my skin always feels so soft , more soft than i think it ever did . i ca n't give any testaments on its firming or anti-wrinkle ability , but i can say it does make my skin glow and my complexion look healthier . the scent is great and it is a great smell to fall asleep to . i would recommend this product to anyone of any age . it has a good price compared to everything else on the market and i believe it is best to start moisturizing when you are young rather than waiting until the signs of aging have already begun . prevention is key
0	do not buy this iron . it 's fabulous while it works , for which it does merit the one star . but it broke in less than a week . it overheated , or something , and then would n't turn on again . but here 's the kicker : if you buy it from amazon , the company wo n't honor the warranty . i do n't have particularly heavy-duty hair . this is just totally unacceptable .
1	i have six children and had been feeling extremely fatigued ( like i could hardly move ) . i had been taking a general multi-vitamin from a local warehouse store . i started taking the nature 's plus source of life , and i felt so much better . my energy level has increased dramatically , and i just feel good . great quality product
1	my husband tried this after i bought it and he loves it . it is a great remedy for a hangover or even just a bad morning . it is very hard to find in most drugstores . now i just buy it on the internet . i 've even recommended it to friends who now swear buy it
0	a fine example of how fickle or intimate ( i prefer the word intimate ) scent is to each of us . this is one fragrance that i have not gotten to like . received as a gift more than a year ago , the bottle still has three-quarters . it does have a `rich ' scent but i find it to be too confusing and indescribable a scent , not educing a one word description like `sporty ' , `sexy ' , `alluring ' . i do n't wear it very often but i do n't recall a single occasion of `what fragrance are you wearing ? ' with this one . it 's just not my cup of tea so definitely , if you 're not familiar with this scent beforehand ; do not buy before trying it out at a department store for a day . why buy ? as a gift for the guy competing for the female that is currently in your crosshairs . as a gift for your boss - you will know he 's coming from a mile away . you need a gift for a guy who could n't pour water out of a boot even if there were instructions on the hee
0	i do n't recommend this ashtray to anyone . i was never able to use it since there were no instructions with it and i could not figure out how to put batteries in . other people tried besides me . there was no way to contact the company as their website does n't seem to exist anymore . at least i could n't contact them after numerous attempts
1	i do n't know why most of the reviews are so negative . mine works perfectly , it does not flip-flop , does not drop down and you can remove those thingies inside to make the water pressure higher for a more soothing shower experience . reason i gave it 4 stars is because i have what is called a `` diverter valve '' attached to my shower head . the waterpik is meant to be installed directly onto the shower head itself . i could not do that , because i have a portable `` wand '' that is moveable via hose connected to the valve and noticed that the threading is too short for the waterpik to latch on to . went to home depot and got an extension and a coupling , kind of ingenious and used lots of pipe tape to `` interface '' the waterpik via the extension , via the coupling onto the diverter valve ... .. wow ! no leaks ! works perfectly . for those of you out there that has a diverter valve for more then one showerhead option , go to home depot , lowe 's or a hardware store and what i wrote above will work as it did for me . enjoy
0	woolite bags waste of money . plan on sewing in your own zipper , cause the one that comes on it will fail probably within the first 4 uses.. maybe the 1st . keit
0	i 'm not sure if i just received a defective pen or what happened . my general experience with cross pens has been very positive . this one , however , is awful . it does n't write smootly and leaves ink everywhere
1	very happy with this purchase . received it in a reasonable time and at a great price including the rebate for signing up for an [ ... ] credit card . it is easy to use and seems more accurate than the wrist type monitors . i like the history feature in order to determine the average blood pressure over a long period of time since pressures change daily ! good machine especially since it has an ac adapter so that there is no need to change batteries frequently ! also , the intellisense feature makes sure the cuff is always properly inflated before readings
1	just love the homedic foot bath . easy to use and very ssothing on the feet . the pedicure attachments are a plus . the price was just great !
0	i have to clarify this is not the same as youthful essence . it does not work the same and the product is not the same . i must clarity that ... i dont want to confuse anyone here . youthful essence for instance is not pasty or harsh , or gritty . it is very smooth , and makes yours skin incredible and soft
0	i really wanted to love this fragrance ... after all , it is quite expensive and i 'd read rave reviews on many websites ... but after one spritz i sold it to a friend of mine ! my favorite perfumes are beyond paradise , ralph lauren romance , ralph lauren style , and dkny be delicious . light blue , to me , smells overwhelmingly of musk . i wore it all day and i ended up feeling nauseous , with a bad headache . this must be one of those perfumes that works well on most everyone else except for me
0	i could not get the right code numbers to work with my new tv/dvd set ... ..too bad , i liked the large numbers and light .
0	i have cracked heals and a bit of a callous problem . they are n't dragon feet , but they do have to be softened pretty often . i have used the little blade scraper tool for a few years and that works well but when i saw the artemis heel smoother advertised , i decided i had to try it . it 's a waste of money . the appliance is no more than a low-tech dreml . in fact , i have a dreml type tool that was marketed as a dog nail trimmer that works better . the artemis appliance does not scrape any dried skin away..it merely sands your foot a bit..that is when you can get the darn thing to stay on the spot you put it on . it comes with a small container of foot conditioning balm that is probably just straight cocoa butter except it has a really offensive aroma . i would just as soon use a piece of sand paper than this thing . save your money .
1	i am very fair and find it difficult to enjoy the sun because i constantly burn . i have tried everything and have never been completely satisfied . i went on my honeymoon to the maldives in november and was able to stay out in the sun , go swimming and i did not have to constantly reapply . i did n't get burned once ! bull frog superblock is the best sunblock around
0	i have a honeywell humidifier that is on my personal top 10 `` must have '' items . i figure with these cartridges the performance could only improve . i was wrong . there is no improvement in the cleanliness of the tank or the filter area . the water actually smells funny with the cartridge in . plus , i have noticed that the little beads inside fall out , and are reported to be harmful to pets and animals . they 're so little it 's hard to see them . not a huge deal to me , but i 'm sure it could pose a problem to someone . all in all , i would rather purchase purified water , or get a water filter for my sink for the water to use in the humidifier than use these , since there is no real difference .
1	man these things are the best . they can handle whatever issues i throw at them . i 've done considerable load testing as i 'm a truck driver who makes infrequent stops . thanks for making my life easier . i 'm totally back into life with depends
0	i 've been using this shaver for almost a year , and am disappointed with it . for years , i 've used the older style remingtons shaped like a rectangular prism . i suppose this new shape is intended to fit the hand better , but i never got used to it . i find myself supporting the shaver with my other hand because i feel like i 'll drop it otherwise . the big problem is with the screen . try very hard to avoid letting your skin come in contact with the edge of the screen . otherwise , the blades will bite you and sometimes draw blood . to clean , it is easy enough to remove the screen assembly , but getting it back on is tricky . if not very careful , it goes on unevenly and gets stuck . with practice , it usually works the first time . the funniest thing about this shaver is the plug that plugs into the wall . it looks like a cutting-edge state-of-the-art plug from the 1920s
1	this handy little device has be a lifesaver in helping to remind me to take my pills . it is easy to set up . just put in the # of hours between your doses , 12 or 24 hours for twice a day or once a day medications . i use two of these . the timer counts down the hours and then chirps . when you silence the alarm , it automatically starts the countdown again . the storage compartment is handy for keeping my pills when i travel . most of the time , i just use it to remind me to take my pills . i wish i knew about this a long time ago
1	i first used this product when i got a straight razor shave in a men 's salon awhile back . it really made for a smooth shave , which you definitely need when getting a straight razor shave . by the way , i do n't recommend getting a straight razor shave on your wedding day as i foolishly did . your face will be very sore . it took me 10 years before i got another straight razor shave , and i hated it as much as the first time . i 'll never get another . however , this oil product made the shave tolerable , and it makes daily shaving fantastic . this combined with the aftershave moisturizer makes for an incredible shave . it 's amazing how soft your skin feels afterward . buy the oil and the moisturizing aftershave , and you wo n't be disappointed
1	i pumped exclusively with my first child and had no need for disposable pads b/c washable ones were sufficient . with my second child , i did both and i found these to be the best b/c washable ones are not enough . they are large so wo n't shift when you roll in bed . they are very absorbent though i have woken up a couple times trenched . they are very thin and discreet . other pads are not as big so not enough overage . i never bother with the adhesives b/c they do n't work . they are a must for nursing moms and pumping moms in the first few month when you have lots of milk . i just wished they were softer and less paper like
1	i 'm a black male and everytime i would shave normally i would get irritated skin and ingrown hairs . at first i 'd feel a little itch throughout the day and by the end of the day i 'd see these tiny little bumps with white heads ( about 10-20 of them ) . that was before . now after i apply the product i do n't have the itch nor do the tiny bumps come up anymore . it just feels like i never had any hair on my face in the first place . the only bad thing about this product is that it burns slightly but i do n't really care i mean it 's not like the product claims to be painless .
0	i followed the instructions and did n't overuse it . the motor went after 2 months . i miss it so much that i am considering getting another one , even though i never got my money back for the first one
1	these bars are supposed to be for women because they are lower cal and have more calcium . i think there are other factors as well . men are usually affraid of products like vitamins for women stangely enough , but they say that they need calcium and protein too . i really like the key lime flavor it is great . i like lemon also and the chi tea . i like those flavors because they are light tasting and i do not always have to have chocolate the way some people do . the lime reminds me of the florida keys . these are really better than the original cliff bars and when they came out i did not eat another man ciff bar . i used to eat one of these for breakfast everyday with a soy milk when i had a busy life . thankfully my life has slowed down now . it is good grab and go food
1	my grandfather found a vial of old spice in his navy kit when he joined in 1943 . he continued using it after the war and my father picked it up when he himself came of age . i began shaving about ten years ago and choice was obvious : old spice is conservative and masculine , distinct and time-honored . it 's not a trend ; it 's a statement of manhood . if proctor gamble obliges , my own grandkids will be using it
0	do n't buy this product . i went through two units with the same problem . the trimmer is made of cheap plastic with plastic tabs to snap onto to the blade . within less than one week the tabs broke and the trimmer would no longer stay attached . further the base/stand is just a lightweight piece of junk that does not properly hold the handle and accessories - very poorly designed , wahl should be embararssed . it did a nice job of trimming my beard but the attachments are so awkward to install and remove , the base practically useless and the trimmer tabs break so easily that i would have given it no stars if possible . the fact that i returned one unit only to get a second that broke within a week makes me wonder what good the two year warranty is worth
0	first of all i was very disappointed when i received my waterpik cf-203c cascadia showerhead . it is all plastic ! i do not recall seeing that anywhere in the product specs . i thought when i oredered a chrome finish that it was some form of metal . sedondly , even with the head made of plastic , the plasic flexible hose is not strong enough to support it . we could not use it because the hose would just hang there and spray the wall . we installed it repeatedly , following each step of the instructions every time , thinking we were missing something . i eventually returned the showerhead to amazon
1	i have had this heating pad for several months and have never had a problem with it . it gets very hot/warm very fast and is very comforting . i use it on my neck and shoulders to help relax the muscles that cause some headaches . i would recommend this product to anyone . i 'm purchasing another one for my stepfather as a gift
0	this stuff does not work at all ! i tried this because it was the only one of the lens repair solutions that did n't have negative feedback , save yourself money and do not buy this product . it looks just like nail polish and leaves the same kind of film on your lense
1	unbeatable for the price ! worked fine right out of the box . easy to use and easy to understand instructions . i 'm glad i bought it
0	i bought this item for the warmth . the heat level is so low that i never can tell when the heat is on . as for the massage , it 's about what i expected - no good at all . overall , i would say this item is worthless .
1	philips sent me a reprogram plug-in that took me only 10 minutes to change the settings to meet the new standards . most of the low price aed 's use camaera batteries . my defibrillator has a long life lithium battary . i wo n't risk someone 's life on store-bought battaries . walt blankenshi
1	as a dentist of over 20+ years experience , i have seen over and over again the results of not flossing one 's teeth . the unfortunate result of such neglect is cavities ( especially in kids ) , and inevitable gum disease in adults , which in both cass over time leads to tooth loss . gum disease almost always starts in-between the teeth and the only way to clean the germs that cause gum disease and cavities from between the teeth is with floss . mechanical scrubbing with floss is the key , and all the daily brushings and rinsings will not remove the in-between stubborn plaque below the gumline . the bottom line is that we need to floss our teeth if we want to keep them for a lifetime . i have heard all the excuses for not flossing : the floss is too hard to handle , my fingers turn blue , my fingers are too fat , i 'm too clumsy , the floss hurts my gums , etc , etc . this disposable flosser is great for kids , who may not have the dexterity to load a non-disposable flosser , such as the `` flossaide dental floss holder '' , which i recommend for adults ( see my review ) . i have recommended this floss aid to my young patients over the years and i strongly recommend it to you as well . one still has to develop the habit of flossing daily , and this device aides in the mechanics of flossing , making it a breeze . get it and save your teeth ! jim `` konedog '' koeni
1	pik stik reacher/grabber did exactly what it said . i used the 32 in size to pick up items from the floor and in the yard . i 'm 5'4 '' and did not have to bend over to pick up things . it picks up coins , small pieces of paper , as well as jars , and leaves/gumballs from outdoors . i am completely satisfied
1	he 'd always had problems with frequent canker sores . after he tried this ( on a recommendation from his dentist ) , his canker sores went from 2-3/week , to 2-3/year !
1	i love the smell of an essential oil in the air . i 've tried tealight burners , a smear on a low-burning lamp , and a miniature crockpot designed for aromatherapy . the pearlessence spa mist is absolutely the best ever for diffusing an odor and continuing to diffuse it for an extended period of time . because i live in a humid climate , i was concerned that misting would only add to mold problems and perhaps mar wooden furniture . the cool mist instantly absorbs even into our air . the light show of the base can be turned off , but i like it most of the time . product was offered for $ 10 less than at a well-known local natural market chain , and shipping was free with my order over $ 25 with other products .
1	the satinelle ice epilator does exactly what it is supposed to do : remove hair quickly and efficiently by the root . what an advantage ! hair does not reappear as quickly as it does shaving , and when it does , it is not the sharp stubble that happens with shaving . i do n't think it hurts much , though some spots may be a bit more sensitive than others . the trick then is to simply lift it up off of the skin and stop momentarily . i am very happy with this product
0	the sleep guard did not keep my mouth open enough at night . my jaws still clenched tight
0	although i have used many electronic cuff devices in the past , this is one of the worst at providing accurate readings . firstly , the cuff is not adequate for very small or larger wrists and the readings are often lower than what you would get if the blood pressure were taken manually the traditional way . in a clinical setting , it is important that you get adequate readings so that the patient can receive the proper treatment based on their readings . it is imperative since you may or may not give medication depending on what you recive via the blood pressure measurement . i have taken a blood pressure manually after getting what i considered a questionable reading only to discover that the wrist blood pressure was far too low and more aggressive measures had to be taken because of the data that was retrieved the old fashioned way . imagine had i taken the initial reading as truth and the patient may have had a stroke as a result . as a rule , i never recommend using these devices for at home use because of the risk of false readings . many people who suffer from hypertension feel that this is a good way of monitoring their blood pressure when in actuality it is giving them a false sense of security . if you are considering buying this product for at home use or for use in a clinical setting , please ask your doctor or nurse for their opinions .
0	plain and simple i 'm 32 years old and been dianosed with hbp since 15 years old . i 'm on three medication for hbp . i order this then i wait for it to come . i jjust happen to go to the doctor today , he takes my pressure and tells me its 113/100 . when i arrive home one hour later , the device is waiting for me . i plug it up and it tells me my pressure is 101/75 . sending the unit back
0	i 've used the same straightener for the past four years and have always been able to get my naturally curly hair perfectly straight . this past christmas though i got the conair tourmaline ceramic straightener as a gift and decided to try it out . not only did it not work for anything , it pulled my hair and broke it at every pass . also , it took more than twice as long as my normal straightener . needless to say , i 'll be taking this back for an exchange . i suggest the normal flat panel straightener for anyone with naturally curly hair
1	it takes some getting used to , but once you do you will love it . it leaves my teeth cleaner than any toothbrush , electric or other , that i have ever used . you feel at first like it is totally strange ( it is ! ) . does n't take more than a few times using it to realize that it 's a great concept and so much faster than anything else . i have no buyers remorse . i just wish that changing the brushes on it were simpler so one brush could be shared with another person . you really are best to have one per person with this one since changing the brush a lot is a hassle
0	i bought this pricey little bottle of lens dr. hoping that it could extend the life of my expensive glasses but what a mistake ! it did nothing but make it worse ! after i saw what it did to the lenses , i had to scrape and scrub to get it off ! i hope that no one else will waste their money on this worthless product . a big rip of
0	these wipes are very rough . we bought these when our daughter was first born and i ended up not using them on her because she would scream everytime i used them . if your baby has sensitive skin i would recommend the huggies newborn or the huggies supreme wipes . wipe your face with one and you will see how scratchy they are . imagine how your baby 's bottom feels afterward
0	i own a more expensive braun but bought this model as a gift for someone who i was n't sure if he would use an electic toothbrush . after 7 months , the toothbrush wo n't turn off-something is shorted out . unfortunately i no longer have the receipt . my more expensive model which i use multiple times a day has been problem free for over five years
1	i got what i expected . it 's functional and not too poorly made . the only problem i had was that the scratcher part was a little too sharp . i filed the sharp edges off and now it 's great . the rolling wheels still have no function for me , but they do n't get in the way
1	they are a nice compact size for travel . they work as advertised , just expect to let them heat up longer than the stated `` quick curl '' time
1	my last braun razor was model 6550 , which i purchased 7 years ago . the braun 8975 is a pleasure using , quick and close shave . the technology has come a long way . i have always used braun and this is by far the best yet .
0	the shampoo works fine , but it has a very different smell that i was not expecting . it smells kind of woodsy/spicy
0	i suppose it serves a function for people with bad eyesight or something . but ... ... dear god that thing is ugly
0	these hair topia pills are nothing but garbage ! pure nonsense ! trust me , i know this because i used to buy them . i first bought these pills last year in june 2005 after hair formula 37 's unsuccessful promise of producing longer and stronger hair in the four months of usage . well , these pills were not as expensive as the previous brand mentioned , and had promised also to change dry and brittle hair to long and healthy , and it did absolute nothing . i said to myself , like hair formula 37 , that maybe i just need to give this more time , so i bought a 2-month supply and gave it 3 months in all and there was no difference at all . this product might just work for others , which it has , but it certainly did n't work for me . i must admit that i brought this on myself , as my mother warned me not to buy these ridiculously expensive pill since they do nothing for hair that grows naturally anyway , and that if you really want to get hair pills then just buy them a whole lot cheaper in regular stores like giant or even hair vitamins in the damn dollar store ! these hair growth pills are too damn expensive , so when you are paying all of that money then you expect it to work . the fact that it does not is infuriating because $ 39.99 + $ 7 in shipping , with a total of a little over $ 46 , is a lot of money to spend on something that does nothing . thus , i am here to warn others not to waste their precious money . and if you are going to , please do n't do it on this site-you can buy this product a little cheaper at hairboutique.com .
1	alka-seltzer got it right and in a big way . drink this and 20 minutes later your headache is gone and your stomach is settled so you can motor down to the local taco stand for some much needed nourishment . i prefer the regular flavor as opposed to the citrus .
0	i was surprised to find positive reviews for this heating pad , since i just returned mine after one use . perhaps the one i got was defective , but even on the highest setting this heating pad was barely warm to the touch and was n't hot enough to penetrate my sore back muscle . i also thought that the convenience of strapping the pad on would be excellent to target the lower back area , and found the shape of the pad and the flimsy elastic strap provided to be very uncomfortable to wear . the placement of the strap does n't allow the pad to conform to the body , but only to press against it where the strap runs through - just the center , not the rest of the pad . i realize there are probably now safety standards for heating pads that preclude them from getting too warm , but hopefully they are not so stringent as to not allow any electric heating device from getting warm enough to penetrate sore muscles properly . for the time being i 'll keep wearing thermacare ( tm ) back wraps ( which are expensive - could have bought two heating pads by now ) but do last 8 hours at a time and provide intense enough heat . also , this disposable product is surprisingly comfortable to wear and more directly applies heat to the area where i need it . if you need intense heat for a sore back , i 'd skip this heating pad
0	i have found that the ms-5700 to be very loud . the braun 8995 that i replaced it with is very quiet . the plastic chrome on the body gives it a very cheap feel , and look , it makes it hard to hold onto . i have found that the shaver dos n't give me a very close shave compared to the braun 8985 shaver . the solution tank for the cleaner seems to be not as user friendly as the braun 8985 that holds a cartridge that slips in and out to replace . as you have read i have replaced the ms-5700 already with the braun 8985 , and am very happy with the change . the braun also came with 3 cartridges for the cleaner unit , not just one bottle to pour into the cleaner .
0	ok ... received this item last night ... used once , and in the process realized i was pointing a laser beam on my skull . given the directions say 3 times a week , 15 minutes per , i would have to do this for a long time with no proven results ... save yourself the time ... do this ... go to google and type in `` forum and hairpro '' . you will find next to nothing regarding information for this product . i made an impulse purchase getting sucked in to the exploitation ... after further research even the top rated hairmaxx brush selling for $ 500 has mixed results on the online forums . not to mention that viatek had spelling errors in the pamphlet that came with the product ... if they do n't have the time to make sure all is spelled right in the manual , how much time did they spend creating the actual product . the box had a date of 2005 and there was dust all over it . these lasers may work , but with all the research i did ( after the purchase ) results seem minimal for all the work that needs to be done . i felt ridiculous using the thing too . i am just annoyed because again i got sucked into a new gimmick for something that companies can exploit in individuals .
0	the reading magnifiers i ordered 09/29/04 finally arrived 10/19/04 after a call to the seller . ( original order was shipped to amazon.com so it had to be reshipped to me . ) it only took 5 minutes or so to assemble one of the reading magnifiers , and it is possible to adjust it to just about any position with the clever arm . the weighted base does keep it from falling over . unfortunately , the thin plastic lense is such poor quality that it is very difficult to receive any benefit from the device . if the user turned the adjustment knob too far , it and the nut that holds it together would fall off . the nut is small and must be inserted into the outside of the adjustment knob to assemble the device . the knob actually turns the nut onto the screw . presumably the device is for someone with low vision . if the small nut falls to the floor , i 'm not sure someone with low vision would be able to find it . my advice is to save your money and buy a quality device with a nice glass lens ... . and if possible , try the device out before buying .
0	in my experience with this product , i had no significant hair growth . very disappointing for the amount of money you spend on it , and the amount of pills you have to take daily ( ugh ! ) . however , i gave it a two because while it did n't grow my hair , it did change the texture of it . my natural hair is very coarse , and while using the hf37 it became really soft , silky and manageable . nice , if that 's what you 're looking for a hair vitamin to do . but as far as hair growth ... absolutely not recommending hf37 for that
0	because if you do , this is the unit to do it with ! the combination of a demineraliztion cartridge that does not work and/or the silver stick has resulted in the total coating of my new macbook pro 's internal circuitry with metal deposits . no , i do not work in a metal shop . i use my computer solely in my apartment room . yes , it is from the humidifer . the dispersion pattern is heaviest around the fan intake areas .
1	this product is simply phenomenal . i 've seen better results using this than with department store brands
1	great product , the girls had a blast with it . real easy to use and real easy to put the gems back in the jeweler once you take them out of your hair . great fun for girls who enjoy dressing up and getting bedazzled ! although it kinds of pulls a piece of hair or two out when you try and slide them out of your hair . not all the time though . still a fabulous product . would highly recommend it . my niece wishes it came with more gems
1	i was skeptical about this product but tried it anyway . it does work and it does eliminate the dip in the middle our mattress had formed . this has given our mattress a little more life so it will last a little longer until it 's time to give in and buy a new one
0	i do n't know if it works or not - i just received it and all i get on it is a low battery reading
1	this is a great little dryer if you travel , or just for home use.well worth the price . cookiema
0	i bought this shaver about one year ago . for years i was using braun shavers and was happy with them but decided to try competition . in spite of few people on internet who mentioned short lifespan i gave panasonic a try . shaving is fine , it runs quiet and you get 5-7 shaves with one charge . after about one year it started making strange noise and you get only 3-4 shaves with one recharge . month later slowly went dead . exactly as some other people wrote on bulletin boards , what make me to believe to those people writing reviews . you would expect more shave for $ 100 . today i went to buy braun shaver .
1	i absolutely love this scale ! it is easy to program and enjoyable to use . best of all , it 's beautiful to behold
0	just received two of these . yes , how dumb of me to buy two not knowing much about it . the quality of the casing is really poor . the plastic is very flimsy feeling . the labels were all half-way peeled off upon opening the box . they show signs of just simply being really old . the instructions are written in many languages which is fine , but there are things they fail to tell you . i also ordered the juice aa 4 pack and 2 of the batteries arrived dead . the charger blinks red with those batteries , but the instructions do not even bother telling you what a blinking red light means . if you go to the juicebattery website , they do not mention this product anywhere . not even when you search for it . a good chance this is a fly-by discontinued product . the company themselves have not responded to by blinking light question for 3 days now . as with many things , made in china ! i got a few more days yet before i need to return them via amazon 's return policy which as we all know , rocks !
0	i got this curler set , and i completely regret it ! i used it once , and i wont touch it again ! it left my hair frizzy , and there was a bump from where the clamps were . it took me 3x as long to get fix my hair as it did to put it in the curlers and wait for it to cool down . i would n't even give it one star ... take my advice- do not buy this !
1	recently got my sleepmate and it is very effective . somehow it blocks out most sounds outside of my bedroom , and i do n't have any trouble sleeping . i use to wake up at least 2-3 times a night , and have the hardest time getting back to sleep . i hardly ever wake up at all now . great product , and i 'd definately recommend it to anyone in need of a good night 's sleep
0	it took my 3 1/2-year-old 10 seconds to defeat this . it took me about 30 minutes to install it . pretty ineffective , as far as i 'm concerned . your mileage may vary
0	why are you paying such good money for a no-calorie water ? ! how many calories does water have to begin with ? ! it would be interesting to see what the placebo was that they used in the double blind trial ( ? a cheeseburger ? ) . please do not buy this . fill a bottle up at home and squeeze a bit of lemon juice in if you have to ... . no calories ! give the money that you would have spend to charity . the makers of this water are thieves and con artists
0	i was offered one of these while cycling and thought it was very tasty . so good , in fact , that when i got home i went straight to the web site show on the back of the wrapper to learn where i could buy them . just above the web address is the nutrition and ingredients list . that was probably a mistake on the manufacturer 's part as it gives you something to read while the site comes up . oops ! this bar has a whooping 25 % of your daily allowance of saturated fat ! not only that , but the fat is palm oil . this might be acceptable for a soldier involved in prolonged strenuous activity but i doubt a cardiologist would recomend it to most of us . a commercially formulated product is more likely to fill the average person 's need for a lower fat ( and healthier fat ) energy bar , than one formulated for extreme physical activity , sold for profit and marketed as a patriotic tribute to the troops . bottom line : read the label , weigh the health risks and if you want to support the troops , there has to be a better way than eating hooah bars .
0	this product is called a `` bouffant style oversized '' shower cap . it is so small that it would not fit over my wife 's head . the product features list claims it is made of `` soft , pretty fabric . '' in fact it is made of thin , crunchy plastic . it is so poorly made that the stiching is crooked , overlaps and has threads hanging in several places . this shower cap went directly in the garbage
1	i really do love this item . i 've been using it without fail since the day it arrived . i have n't had any significant problems with it and highly recommend it for anyone . i hated wearing the chest strap on my other monitor . the only problem i have found is that i ca n't grip things and have the monitor continue working . so when i am lifting weights i have to leave that finger extended , when i 'm using the eliptical trainer i have to leave that finger extended . now that i 'm used it , it is n't a big deal . it is accurate . so far it has agreed with all other monitors that i 've checked it against . so with the one minor exception i highly recommend it
0	i like to use the wet wipes , they 're good products . i gave only 2 stars because the package was n't packed well . i received the package this week . all seals of three boxes were broken , lids fell off , and the wipes were everywhere in the package , they were dried up , but the amazon packing box was all soaked wet , and it almost fell apart . what a mess it was !
1	great piece of equipment , no guessing how accurate the scale might be with this great healthometer
1	yes , i did feel a difference . benadryl is not effective for me so i was sceptical . i am glad i found this . i use for when i need to sleep in an unfamiliar place
1	necessary replacement brush heads to maintain correct oral hygeine with rotary braun electric toothbrush . i foung amazon.com 's price for this item cheaper than costco or sam 's club ! ! !
1	my daughter and i have searched for a sunscreen that both of us would like , and never found one that was completely satisfactory . she has oily skin prone to breakouts , and mine is combination . every one we tried always left a greasy feel and look to the face , even the ones that were supposed to be oil-free . finally , i came across a review of this product on paula begoun 's website ( www.cosmeticscop.com ) . the review sounded good , so i went out and bought some right away . my daughter and i both love this product ! it 's the only sunscreen we have ever used that does n't leave a greasy feel or look to the skin . it dries to a matte finish , and works very , very well under foundation , too . without foundation , there is no need to use powder to kill the shine . and it feels so light on the skin , you barely know it 's there ! if you have oily or combination skin and have never found a sunscreen that does n't look and feel greasy , try this one ! it 's the best !
0	this thing is unbelievably lame . it does n't massage . it vibrates . y'all have sat in massage chairs before at sharper image or brookstone . they can be really good , with kneading balls that roll around giving a surprisingly deep back massage . this thing does n't even resemble those chairs . trust me . i am sitting in one now . it is my main office chair . i have not turned on the `` massage '' function , or even plugged it in , since about three days after i bought it . the `` massage '' feature is more like an annoy feature . it just shakes you around a bit , but does n't actually feal good in any way .
0	after hearing about this product and reading the reviews , decided to get one for our newborn baby . the problem however , is that this does not cover the entire room even on its `` high '' setting . over the course of an hour , i would say this thing covers only a sixth of the air in our room ( 12 x 12 ) . i put my hand in front of the sanitizer and could barely feel any airflow and this was on the high setting . i 've only had this product for a month so i will have to follow-up on durability . first month impression is this thing is too weak to adequately sanitize an entire room . if it were a bit stronger , would give a better rating . i feel like i will return this item and get a stronger air cleaner , or buy 3 of these ( not practical )
0	this thing messed up my back . it is extremely uncomfortable and i ca n't see anyone liking the feel of it . furthuremore it smells terrible . do not buy this product - you will regret it . ( shipping was n't bad
1	these are great for those days you just want to sit in the sun and read without sun glare . great product
1	overall an excellent trimmer - this is what i have been needing all of these years . finally a piece of equipment that does it all . i have been very pleased with this trimmer - it is solid , and cuts without problem . i love the adjustments , and the removeable head . thanks remington , and my wife for the christmas present
1	it does a great job , i just tought it wound n't let any hair go , but i gess that 's impossible
1	if you live in an old building where the toilet is always getting clogged by your abundant use of regular toilet paper , then this is the brand and variant you should switch to . if i were to objectively judge it by what it promises ( rapidly dissolves ... ) , i 'd have to give it five stars . it practically melts as soon as it touches water . do n't expect to be able to use it for mopping water off the sink ; you 'll just end up with a mess of dissolved tissue . i 'm giving it only four stars , because it 's not my favorite toilet paper ( that would be charmin ultra ) , but the necessary choice .
1	this baby has helped me track my heart through all the highs and lows and ultimately allowed me to assist my doctor in verifying that something is seriously wrong with my blood pressure . we 're yet to verify what the culprit is ... but this little guy helps me know when to slow down or kick it up a notch . i would highly recommend this guy if you 're looking for a wrist-inflatable blood pressure monitor . it 's been consistant , reliable , and informative for both myself and my doctor
0	sure it has many pretty lights and a slick design . one problem though : it is terrible at shaving ! i was using my old braun 6520 , and was quite happy with it . then i saw a good deal for this `` new , redesigned , superb , self-cleaning '' shaver and decided to upgrade . bad idea ! after shaving with it , it looks like i have a day-old stubble . no matter how much i twist and press it , the `` new super system of blades designed by no one other than gillette '' does a bad job . this morning i actually pulled my old 6520 out , shaved off as much as i could with this `` 360 complete '' garbage , and then used 6520 to see how much `` clean up '' it would do . the difference was both very visible and substantial ! i am really sorry i bought this and feel duped by their marketing ... do n't make the same mistake as me . buy something else and save your money
0	i purchased these but had to return them . while the molded strap is adjustable , it only opens up approx . 1 '' . the magnetic attachment worked well but if your head is 23.5 '' or larger around - at the eyebrows , forget it , these will not fit you
0	i bought this straightener two times..the first time i had it for about 8 months . my friend had bought the straightener and i fell in love , so i bought my own . the first 8 months were heaven . i straightened my hair all the time . then , at 8 months , one of the plates stopped working ! for a while i used it , but it took forever , and did n't straighten my hair well at all . i decided to buy another , thinking that it was just a defect on the first . i bought the other and it did n't work nearly as well as i had remembered ! in fact , it stopped heating up all together within 3 months ! ! another friend of mine bought this same straightener and it caused problems for her as well . we have both decided against buying this one again , obviously , and i would reccommend you do , too . i have heard that the newest conair straightener is wonderful , and comes with a two-year warranty , so i would n't have to pay again , if it did the same thing to me that this one did . do n't buy it ! unless , of course , you enjoy being ripped-off..
0	worthless . motor is loud and heating not noticable . in 10 minutes hot water became luke warm
1	i really like this curling iron ... - and you definitely ca n't beat the price ! it heats up very quickly , and gives me great curls . the key to working with large barrel curls are to use a mouse or cream to texturize your hair . then , after you curl , make sure to take a blowdryer on cold/low setting to lock the curls down . i always receive so many compliments on my hair ! !
1	i have been using this razor for about 6 years now , probably as long as they have been out . they may be pricey but well worth it . i used to use disposables and nicked/cut my legs almost every time . i switched to these and have maybe nicked my legs very little . it is so quick and easy to use , and my legs are much smoother than they ever were with disposables and shaving creams . they do only last for 3-5 shaves , but if you figure in the price of disposables and shaving cream , it 's probably not that much more expensive
0	do n't be fooled by the similar-sounding , inarticulate reviews -- this product is not what you think it is . it contains neither motor nor electrical stimulation . the `` energy fields '' described have nothing to do with actual energy/electricity -- they might as well use the word `` aura '' for all of the logical sense it makes . in the words of a company representative : the tingler is not battery operated there is no button . that would be our sqwiggler which has 2 aa batteries located in the handle . you 're welcome to return the tingler for a sqwiggler . the sqwiggler is $ 29.95 please call 800-978-8765 and we can get your credit card information and charge the amount difference of $ 9.95 plus $ 8.45 for the shipping fees . make your own judgement , but do n't expect to be as wowed or thrilled as the company claims you 'll be
1	great for people with sensitive skin or prone to acne . i began using neutrogena as a teenager 25 years ago . it helped clear up teen acne has kept my skin free of razor burn in more recent years
0	the foil is a bit misleading , because if you are shaving parts of your body with many curves ( under the zipper ) the timmer will catch you and it hurts , a lot . the foil can only be used on straight surfaces . the two trimmer blases rest at about a 200degree angle . if you have to many curves to mow with the foil without hitting the trimmer ... . well , be prepared to spend a night or two on the sofa
0	i recieved these dead , they do n't fit right in most devices and i have n't been able to get them to work since they 've been recharged , it 's not my charger ... .. waste of mone
1	i love this book light ! it has survived countless drops to the hardwood floor by me and my 2 year old . it works great with hardback and paperback books . this is by far the best book light i have ever used
0	oprah winfrey and kevin costner the leading medical researchers in america think this is a great break through . well gee , if they like it you must too . there is no scientific basis other than the nice school teachers `` guarantee '' that this works . after you pay 5-6 bucks for some fizzing tablets that taste kind of good you might think something is happening . well it probably is , in your psyche . if that and kevin costner testimonials do it for you then go ahead . ca n't seem to find the `` guarantee '' on their web site other than they will do their darndest to improve the product and you 'll be the first to benefit
1	i find the item in perfect shape and operates effectively thank you so much bimvik
0	stay away from this seller `` salter '' . i ordered this product 20 days ago and finally got an email saying that there 's an unexpected delay ! i cancelled right away , after waiting for almost a month
0	unfortunately , this is poorly designed . it is too high to rest you wrist on comfortably and the 'stimulating ' rolling rubber parts are too hard and abrasive
0	the seams on the pillow are sharp and uncomfortable . the extra pouches that supposedly provide additional support do n't measure up . the snaps that should hold the ends together do n't work . basically , it would be ok if it came with a soft cover
0	after many disastrous leakage experiences with their smaller-size diapers , i decided to give huggies another try because i have a very active toddler , and these certainly did appear to be stretchy and comfortable . unfortunately , this comfort comes at the expense of utility . my daughter was no sooner running around in the first diaper out of the pack , when i saw the entire contents of her diaper coming out the sides and up her back . just like the smaller sizes , this version does not hold anything in ! ! !
1	this is an exceptional value for an exceptional dryer . i have paid alot more for more well known , brand named dryers . i have long thick hair and this product dries my hair in half the time other dryers have done in the past . buy this hair dryer , you wo n't be sorry
1	i bought this toothbrush a month ago , and have been very satistfied with it . the battery lasts about a month and the brush leaves me with a clean feeling that you ca n't get from a manual toothbrush . the price is good , the battery life is good , and the battery door is very easy to open ! i would buy it again !
1	the knots in my back - my `` spots '' never really go away due to posture and my work in front of the computer . one day i asked a coworker what the odd green thing by his desk was . he explained the concept , i tried it for about two seconds and immediately knew this was something special . the leverage is perfect for zeroing in on your back knots and applying strong pressure to them - like having a strong friend digging their knuckle in and holding it there . i bought one the next day . you do n't need an expensive vibrating massage wand that has all sorts of silly features - just this simple stick that can pinpoint and dissolve all your stress spots .
0	it works , but it takes a long time to really trim it down . very low power , made of plastic . i do n't recommend this product
1	i have seen these in catalogs before did n't give them a second thought . then one day when i was cleaning under around all of my shampoo bottles , etc in the shower , it hit me that one of these might just consolidate all the shampoos/conditions body wash that i have collected in my shower . so , i ordered one a higher price i am so thrilled that i am ordering one for the kids ' bathroom where i had hubby put in an extra shelf just to hold all the shampoos etc . now it will all be in one place , not messy out of the reach of my toddler ! the other thing that i have noticed is that i do n't use nearly as much shampoo as i did before - i get a few squirts if that is n't enough , i get more - no more dumping a handfull of shampoo in my hand . i know i use far less shampoo than i did before i had this so i am no longer wasting it ! this is just the greatest concept this product is very easy to keep clean it works looks great in the shower . i would recommend this product to anyone ! if you do n't think you will fill up all four sections - get a smaller one but i found the 4 section one is just what i needed ; one for clarifying shampoo , one for conditioning shampoo , one for conditioner one for body wash. no more bars or shampoos cluttering my bathroom
1	definitely the best heating pad i 've ever experienced . i 'll never buy any other kind of heating pad again . this is by far the best and well worth the money . i love that it can set the temperature precisely and much higher than any other heating pads i 've ever seen ( that only have `` high medium and low '' settings , and usually the high and medium settings cause burns , or do n't get hot enough , or go from barely any heat to burning ! ) this heating pad 's lcd shows the actual temperature it 's at , which is great . and yes it feels very moist , but not like you 're getting dampness on your clothing . my only complaint is that it shuts off after 60 minutes . i could easily have this on all day :
1	this is the best sound machine out there ... ..i worked in a doctors office where they used these , and they were amazing . my husband can not sleep without some sort of `` white noise '' . we purchased this and our sleep could n't be better . best bet for the money . it 's also adjustable as far as volume , just twist the top . very quick shipping as well .
0	i liked this heating pad so much when i first used it that i immediately ordered a second one ( for what i expected would be a year or two in the future ) . what i liked was that the wiring was indeed much thinner than other pads , allowing it to conform to the shape of my body . however , the first pad lasted only two weeks before failing to heat . i returned it to homemedics and they ignored me . the second one lasted nearly a month before it to failed to heat . i will not bother wasting the postage to return this one , as obviously homemedics does not care about quality nor customer satisfaction . i recommend that you not waste your money on this defective product
1	i purchased this for my husband . he hates to shave everyday and now he can without the razor burn . it is even as close a shave as if he used a razor ! i saw it on the consumers number one pick for foil shavers and i am glad i went with their reccomendation
1	no problems . like the small format bottle , easy to store . works as well as anything else
0	terrible reception . tinny speaker . radio does not `` remember '' last used station when turned off . do n't waste your money
1	this razor is fantastic . the gel pieces are very soft and keep even my dry skin from being too bad ! ! the only problem i had with it was the gel parts do n't last quite as long as a bottle of shaving cream/gel would . but if you are looking for a quick , handy and yet still good shave , this is exactly what you are looking for
0	why are you paying such good money for a no-calorie water ? ! how many calories does water have to begin with ? ! it would be interesting to see what the placebo was that they used in the double blind trial ( ? a cheeseburger ? ) . please do not buy this . fill a bottle up at home and squeeze a bit of lemon juice in if you have to ... . no calories ! give the money that you would have spend to charity . the makers of this water are thieves and con artists
1	you wo n't have to use much lotion on your body after using this product . i love it ... .
1	i saw these reading glasses on csi : ny and just had to have them ! it 's really nice to have a quality pair of reading glasses ... and the wow factor does n't hurt either ! i 've read some of the reviews and can see where women with hair past their shoulders might have a problem with this type of glasses . my hair is shortish ( layered to the bottom of my neck ) and i would n't want it any longer if i was going to wear these glasses a lot ... which i do ! they are n't portable ... but they are n't supposed to be . i keep mine in my office where i need to take them on and off the most frequently . i 'll probably get another pair for home but i 'll used my old ones i can put in my case for carrying in my purse . all in all ... i 'm very glad i got them
1	this is very easy to use and quite convenient . i 'm not sure , however , how accurate this monitor is . it seems to record a higher reading than a manual one at times . the value of this home monitor is if the readings change dramatically . then it 's a warning to go to the doctor 's
1	yes it is pricey but worth it . i tried the gilette skin care and liked it . at that point , $ 5 bucks for 1.7 ounces felt crazy . so when i bought this i thought i must be mad . but for my skin it works fantastic . it also has the distinct advantage of how it dispenses . you get a controlled amount unlike a tube by pressing down on the top . yes you can not see how much is left . but i have had tubes that are not clear and you are in the same boat . at least here you have the best possible non-clear dispenser you could get . i have always had good skin so i do not need that much to have good results . it is not greasy nor does it have much of a fragerence . it leaves my skin feeling smooth and has made shaving easier and smoother . probably the q10 is a bunch of hype . and yes i usually buy sauve or 'swiss formula ' which are much less pricey . i can get 2 months out of 1.7 ounces . under $ 4 a month to feel great and help protect my skin ? worth it to me
0	it makes glasses stain . and i return it within 1 week
0	the slippers look nice and smell great . they were difficult for me to get on my feet . the lining was too restrictive . once they were on , they were very awkward and uncomfortable to take any steps . it 's unlikely that i will ever use them on my feet . i will only use the inserts for aromatherapy
1	these wipes are strong , have just the right amount of moisture , and do n't leave that slimy feeling that most of the major brands leave . my son had diaper rashes as a newborn ; when we were at home , we could wash/rinse him with water and dry completely before rediapering , but when we were out , and had to use wipes , his rash would flare up . after switching to these wipes and 7th gen diapers , the rash went away . later on , i tried pampers again , and the rash came back . using seventh gen really has kept his skin rash free . my older son also has a lot of itching when we use pampers ; much less with these wipes diapers
1	i encountered these at last week 's carlsbad triathlon . they tasted really good and i figured if it 's good enough for the military , i 'll give it a try ... sure enough , the military knows what it 's doing -- it seems to work as claimed . thumbs up , or , hooah
1	i have several of these glasses now . love them . they are strong and adjustable and so much better then wearing the granny cord around your neck . i wish there was a berrer looking sunglass besides that goggle looking one . good price and good product .
1	i bought this gadget with the intent of monitoring my daily steps to get an idea of where i was currently to establish some sort of baseline so that i could get a reality check on my activity levels . i opened the box , read the easy directions , set up my personal step measurement ( just measure off the distance of your 10 steps ) , and clipped it on my pants and forgot about it for the day . i was surprised to find out that a corpse could probably move around more during the day than me ! over the next 6 days , ( this pedometer keeps track of 7 days of steps for you ) ; i literally stepped up my game and went from 756 steps with no aerobic exercise on day 1 , to 7,880 steps with 30 minutes of nonstop aerobic exercise on day 3 ! every day has been getting easier to achieve the 10,000 `` normal '' steps , and increasing the aerobic steps too ( which are tracked separately ) . i can press the mode button , check out how many miles my steps translate to , kilocalories burned , aerobic steps , and compare it with the past 7 days as well . it has turned out to be even more fun than what i originally bought it for . i actually feel better , and the fun part is that i am trying to beat my own personal record from the previous day ! this has been an eye-opening experience for me , and i keep this on or in my pocket all the time now , just to make sure i keep a mindful eye on my steps and aerobic activity for the day
1	now i finally have the look and feel of a celebrity . the best product on earth period ! i 've tried all ingrown hair product 's since 1985 beleive me ive ' spent thousand of dollars , nothing comes close to it `` forget about it '' saliylic acid is history in my book . sorry dermatologist their is a cure . i bought 1 bottle before christmas 2006 . since the new year 2007 started i 've already bought 2 bottle 's and i 'm spreading the word . do n't delay a smooth and perfect face is just a few days away . thanks to all who have complimented my slick and smooth face . j. diaz aka ( papi rico
1	since having back problems , especially waking up in the morning , this lumbar extender works wonders for my back . i can easily have a good start for the day from now on ! ! many thanks . b
0	the pick at the back of the unit is curved and does n't work well . the floss is multi-stranded and tends to come apart when used and does n't feel like it is very high quality floss . the head is also somewhat small or poorly shaped so it is also difficult to use . i used the plackers brand before and was much happier with it
0	printed all over the box are the words `` with infrared heat '' . the instructions state that you must add warm water to the machine before you start , and the infrared mechanism is supposed to maintain the water 's warm temperatures . this would n't be the case . the water cools in a matter of minutes after turning the bubbles and massage functions on . turning on the infrared light on top of the machine looks nice , but does nothing at all to keep the water warm .
1	i bought this product because i had one from years ago that i use when i go to the gym but lost . it 's great at drying me off while i 'm working out and yet the towel is n't wet . i am conflicted though . i bought this one when i lost the one i already had . it 's a bit thinner and not the same deminsion as the original , but i still like it for what it does . i also like the little bag that it comes in , which i did n't have with the original one
1	i used to own a brush from another manufacturer . it never brushed well : the heads wore out waaaaaaaay too quickly . i just never felt i was getting a good brush . after using this brush for about a couple of months , i went in for a regular checkup . my dentist told me my teeth had never looked better . that 's all the testimony i need
1	tastes great , and it 's good for a normal weight training person like me
0	absolutely the worst cream ever ! after about a week of using it , my skin turned very red and then gray/brown ! i developed severe wrinkling and my skin became rubbery and loose . i went to a dermatologist who did a biopsy and said that i had developed elastolytic granulomas over the area where the cream was put - the elastin in those areas was destoyed and there was a scarring like pattern of collagen . the normal architecture of the dermal/epidermal junction was also lost - causing melanin from the epidermis to fall into the dermis - basically causing permanent discoloration ! dont listen to the false hype on the net - that hype is coming from people trying to make money off this stuff - take the advice of someone who has actually used this product - copper peptide products are not good for your skin
0	i 've been using trimspa x32 for over a year and , with a decent diet and regular excersise , i 've lost over 40 pounds . the x32 formula has helped me maintain my weight with no side effects at all . i , too , decided to use trimspa energy because it was new and improved , but was sorely disappointed . the engergy formula is way too high powered ( 200mg caffeine per pill ) for me and has made me feel `` sped-up '' , sweaty , greasy and just plain gross . and that 's taking under the suggested dosage . i 'm sure that it will help drop the pounds for you ... at the expense of dilated pupils , shaky hands and acting sketchy . i do n't think this pill should be legal and should come with stronger warnings . i 'm going back to the other formula tomorrow ... that is if i can get to sleep !
1	this is the one i buy for friends and the one they use at my pediatricians office . it is like the one i bought 5 years ago with my first baby , the one that is still humming along . i have been really happy with our thermometer with the exception that it was-and-is still too big to use with my second child , a boy who persists in having 'tiny ' ear canals even though he is three now . it has worked well for every other kid i know though . about the variation in temperature taking . my advice is to practice taking your and your children 's temperature while you and they are healthy . for one thing , not everyone has the `standard ' 98.6 degree normal temperature ; and for another thing it is n't always easy to get the tip pointed in the right direction once it is in the ear canal . it takes practice . a good home purchase . ( for really little babies we used a pacifier thermometer with great success .
1	good for dust storms in desert-like environments . great for looking suave . very convenient for easy on/off .
1	i took `` my '' unit to a monthly meeting for seniors . their machine broke i took mine as a replacement . they liked it so well , they had me buy this unit for the monthly meetings . they like all the different aspects of the machine . a suggestions could be to include a card that you could carry in your wallet write down the date the numbers from the machine ?
1	i have never used a roller . after reading the reveiws i decided to purchase two set of rollers . i have long hair . it works really great on my hair . looking at my hair everyone says it looks beautiful
1	27 ounces is a nice size , the bottle is light ( can be dented ) , and water stored in it tastes very good ... .and that will be even more welcome in the summer when a hot plastic water bottle in the car will taste lousy ! another reviewer mentioned a squeal ... ... that would be while twisting the cap on or off . i 've gotten used to that . wish it was just a hair thinner to fit in my toyota cupholder ... that may not be an issue with toyotas that are newer than mine are ( 10 15years ) . in the car , on the nightstand , in the canoe or kayak ... ..it 's working for me
0	this product might do for a backpacking weekend with the boy scouts , but compared to a blade razor , or even an electric , it leaves a lot to be desired . i recommend giving it a pass
0	it 's a handy mirror for the price but if your looking for a good vanity mirror , i suggest looking for something larger with a higher magnification . the light is not great at all . it 's very dim . one of the good qualities of the mirror is that it 's cordless and comes with an adapter if you do n't have batteries handy
1	i have been using kiss my face olive oil soap for years , and i wo n't let any other soap touch my face ! i found it when i was searching for a soap that would n't make my skin itch all over after a shower . i can tell you that after years and years , my sensitive skin has never once itched after i used kmf ! the soap is mild , with a neutral scent , which is a big plus . it cleans great , but does n't leave my skin dried out . the 8 ounce bars are a bit large , but worth the wait until they shrink down to a size that 's easier for us smaller-hands people
0	i do n't have a particularly large skull but these barely fit together on the bridge of my nose . i do n't see how the manufacturer can claim one size fits all ; as i said i do n't have a huge melon like mike myers 's brother in `` so i married an axe murderer '' . the idea/concept is great but ... i 'll probably return them . unfortunate because i was really looking forward to using them . people with really big heads , caveat emptor
0	i 'm sorry that i ordered these online . i should have tried them first . they do not fit round heads . no matter how many times you adjust them they do not fit . the bow needs to have an adjustment too . the magnet is not that strong when put on a round head they just pop off . would not buy another pair .
0	if you 're interested in the chrome model to match your stainless steel appliances be prepared to constantly polish it due to the water spots . my friend owns one and at first i was envious , but now i rather be less fashionable than freak out over the visible water spots . this model has the same shape as the riviera and as i stated in my other review althought it is ergonomic , the riviera collects algae on the bottom of the pitcher so i would be skeptical in buying this one . the only reason i gave it two stars because it ultimately looks cool but you ca n't avoid the water spots and it may be algae friendly .
1	if you  " get it "  ,  it's magnificent .   if you don't ,  it's decent .   please understand that  " getting it "  does not necessarily mean you've gone through a school shooting .  there is so much more to this movie that ,  at times ,  the school shooting becomes insignificant .   above all ,  it's a movie about acceptance ,  both superficially--of a traumatic event ,  but also of people who are different for whatever reason .   it's also a movie about unendurable pain ,  and how different people endure it .  in this case ,  the contrast between alicia's rage and deanna's obsession creates an atmosphere of such palpable anxiety that halfway through the movie we wonder how the director could possibly pull a happy ending out of his hat .  thankfully ,  the audience is given credit for being human beings ;  our intelligence is not insulted by a sappy ,  implausibly moralistic ending .   above and beyond that ,  i try to keep a clear head about movies being fiction and all that .  yet i must admit ,  i cried like a lost little baby during this movie .  there were certain things about it that hit *very* close to home and opened up some old wounds that never quite healed .  but that is not necessarily a bad thing . 
1	   " burning paradise "  is a combination of neo-shaw brothers action and ringo lam's urban cynicism .  when one watches the film ,  they might feel the fight scenes are only mediocre in nature but that doesn't matter ,  it's attitude and atmosphere that counts .  this great film has both !  !  always trying to be different than his contemporaries ,  lam gives us to traditional heroes ( fong sai-yuk and hung shi-kwan ) and puts them in a  " raiders of the lost ark "  setting .  however ,  these are not the light-hearted comedic incarnations that you might see in a jet li movie .  instead these guys fight to the death with brutal results .  what makes the film even better is that anyone could die at anytime ,  there is no holding back .  too bad ,  they don't make films like this more often . 
1	this is definitely an appropriate update for the original ,  except that  " party on the left is now party on the right .  "  like the original ,  this movie rails against a federal government which oversteps its bounds with regards to personal liberty .  it is a warning of how tenuous our political liberties are in an era of an over-zealous ,  and over-powerful federal government .  kowalski serves as a metaphor for waco and ruby ridge ,  where the us government ,  with the cooperation of the mainstream media ,  threw around words like  " white supremacist "  and  " right wing extremists as well as trumped-up drug charges to abridge the most fundamental of its' citizens rights ,  with the willing acquiescence of the general populace .  that message is so non-pc ,  i am stunned that this film could be made - at least not without bringing the federal government via the irs down on the makers like they did to juanita broderick ,  katherine prudhomme ,  the western journalism center ,  and countless others who dared to speak out .   " live free or die "  is the motto on jason priestly's hat as he brilliantly portrays  " the voice ,  "  and that sums up the dangerous  ( to some )  message of this film .   
1	i love ghost stories in general ,  but i particularly love chilly ,  atmospheric and elegantly creepy british period-style ghost stories .  this one qualifies on all counts .  a naive young lawyer  (  " solicitor "  in britspeak )  is sent to a small village near the seaside to settle an elderly ,  deceased woman's estate .  it's the 1920s ,  a time when many middle-class brits go to the seaside on vacation for  " their health .  "  well ,  guess what ,  there's nothing  " healthy "  about the village of crythin gifford ,  the creepy site of the elderly woman's hulking ,  brooding victorian estate ,  which is located on the fringes of a fog-swathed salt marsh .  when the lawyer saves the life of a small girl  ( none of the locals will help the endangered tot -- you find out why later on in the film )  ,  he inadvertently incurs the wrath of a malevolent spirit ,  the woman in black .  she is no filmy ,  gauzy wraith ,  but a solid black silhouette of malice and evil .  the viewer only sees her a few times ,  but you feel her malevolent presence in every frame .  as the camera creeps up on the lawyer while he's reading through legal papers ,  you expect to see the woman in black at any moment .  when the lawyer goes out to the generator shed to turn on the electricity for the creepy old house ,  the camera snakes in on him and you think she'll pop up there ,  too .  waiting for the woman in black to show up is nail-bitingly suspenseful .  we've seen many elements of this story before ( the locked room that no one enters ,  the fog ,  the naive outsider who ignores the locals' warnings )  but the director somehow manages to combine them all into a completely new-seeming and compelling ghost story .  watch it with a buddy so you can have someone warm to grab onto while waiting for the woman in black .   .   . 
1	daniel day lewis in my left foot gives us one of the best performances ever by an actor .  he is brilliant as christy brown ,  a man who has cerebral palsy ,  who then learned to write and paint with his left foot .  a well deserved oscar for him and brenda fricker who plays his loving mother .  hugh o'conner is terrific as the younger christy brown and ray mcanally is great as the father .  worth watching for the outstanding performances . 
1	personal taste rules when it comes to talking about movies such as this treasured little gem .  way back in the eighties ,  the early eighties ,  i discovered this movie ,  like so many released at the time ,   " night patrol "   " bad manners "  or even  " king frat "  the artwork and blurbs on the back of the covers tempted and teased you .   of course being of an age ,  movies like that i have already mentioned as well as stuff like  " screwballs "  and the many others ,  captured the imagination ,  and thankfully many years later i still remember some with fondness and some with disdain the many movies that help maintain my love of such genre as parodies or pastiches .   made many years after the huge success of  " animal house "  and having seen how it had fared down through the years ,  i now know that there would be no way this movie would ever eclipse the box office bucks obtain aforementioned nor would it linger in the memory ,  much like that of national lampoon's vacation .   to be honest ,  not everything that has carried the national lampoon logo has been a wild success ,  however to me class reunion remains one of my all time favourite movies ,  with instantly recognisable characters ,  such as the aloof bob spinnaker played to perfection by gerrit graham ,  so good in charles band's  " terrorvision "  still lingering in the past glories of his youth .  or how about stephen furst's brash and ballsy turn as the high school lazy drunken sex crazed bum hubert downs .   sweet as .  which makes me ponder .  as i already said ,  personal taste not withstanding .  people can be so cruel ,  so it will never win any awards or be compared to the like of its's peers within the comedy world .  it does have some merit .  being one of the earlier scripts penned by john hughes ,  who would later go on to do one of my own favourites of his work  " weird science "  as well as having a wonderful theme title sung by the great gary u . s bonds .   what more can i say ,  it's a movie just waiting to be rediscovered ,  time and time again . 
1	this indie film looks at the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class in connecticut .  the plot is fairly thin .  what drives the film is the characters ,  excellently played by mostly unknown actors .  standouts in the cast are brewster as a high school teacher experiencing marital problems and weixler as a casino dealer who moonlights as a stripper .  the two actresses give natural performances and work well together .  this is an impressive feature film debut for writer schechter and director setton .  the latter keeps the narrative moving at a fast clip .  the film title and poster suggest something raunchy ,  but this is a marvelous little comedy-drama . 
1	panic delivers the goods ten fold with oscar caliber performances from william h macy ,  neve campbell ,  and donald sutherland .  in a movie about the choices we make and the consequences we live with .  chillingly honest and thought provoking ,  panic is easily one of the best film to come out of hollywood in years .  the impact stays with you right after you leave the theater . 
1	one of the great classic comedies .  not a slapstick comedy ,  not a heavy drama .  a fun ,  satirical film ,  a buyers beware guide to a new home .   filled with great characters all of whom ,  cary grant is convinced ,  are out to fleece him in the building of a dream home .   a great look at life in the late 40's .   
1	when i found the movie in the schedule for christmas ,  its title did not sound familiar to me since i have not read the novel and had not heard anything about the film .  yet ,  having read the content ,  i decided to spend my christmas evening on watching the movie .  the effect surprised me totally :  i do not remember when i last saw a film in which every single moment involved me .  a vow to cherish is ,  without any doubt ,  one of the movies that now constitutes a real surprise i have received from cinema .  here are some arguments of mine why i consider this film a highly underrated piece of good cinema .    first ,  the entire content is particularly educational .  it has something to offer to the modern audience - pure right faith and some answers for the universal questions .  is there a need for christ in our times ?  does love still matter ?  what for is there faith ?  what is the logics of burden and suffering in life ?  is there really someone by my side i can always trust ?  the movie provides the answers through the content since all that happens to the characters may as well happen to any of us .   second ,  the movie is exceptionally humane .  the main characters experience inner struggles and cope with extremely hard decisions .  is it better for kyle david denman )  and teri  ( megan paul )  to start their own lives and forget about the family or retain the values they were taught at home ?  is it better for john  ( ken howard )  to leave ellen  ( barbara babcock )  ,  his sick wife ,  and start a new happy life with julia  ( donna bullock )  ,  a woman he falls in love with ?  in fact ,  ellen no longer recognizes him .  .  .  yet ,  he decides to vow his wife eternal fidelity .  had john's rebellious brother ,  phil  ( d .  david morin )  ,  better go on his easy life although it does not bring him satisfaction or once start to think seriously of his life .  phil's prayer to god in the park is a psychological masterwork of universal aspect of humanity .  these words could be as well said by everybody no matter of where ,  when or how they live .   third ,  the movie is a great portrayal of family ,  not very popular nowadays :  there are problems ,  yet ,  there is always something more powerful that gets these people together .  this  " something "  is love and trust .  i know that it may seem a bit idealistic .  not all families can rely on fidelity and it may not be as simple as that .  nevertheless ,  it is a very educational aspect and a realistic one .   fourth ,  the entire film focuses on people's mutual help .  if we want to live happy lives in our society ,  we must understand one thing :  we have to help one another .  alexander  ( ossie davis )  is an example of such attitude .  at the beginning of the movie ,  we see him talk to john about praying .  later ,  he helps his brother .  alexander is a kinda  " angel "  that is sent to john and his family .  isn't it possible that we may become angels to one another ?   fifth ,  the artistic features are also worth attention .  performances :  barbara babcock gives an authentic performance as ellen and although she has a difficult role ,  she does a perfect job .  consider ,  for instance ,  the moment she appears at school and badly wants to teach again .  ken howard is also memorable as the faithful husband .  picture :  the most memorable for me was the scene of john and ellen in the park walking on the fallen leaves  ( autumn )  while the sunshine  ( love )  spreads everywhere .  i interpreted as a sort of symbol :  even if there is sorrow ,  this can always be illuminated by light and joy .  .  .   a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie that realistically showed to me what it means to love ,  what fidelity is as well it once again proved to me how beautiful it is to live and believe .  at the end ,  i would like to quote the profound words from the movie i found very touching and hope you will also do   kyle to his uncle phil :  yes ,  he  ( john brighton )  lives according to the bible .  but nobody forces you to do so .  yet ,  according to what rules do you live ? 
0	i have never seen a movie as bad as this .  it is meant to be a  " fun "  movie ,  but the only joke is at the start ,  and it is not funny .  if you like this sort of movie ,  then you may just be able to give it a vote of 2 .  if it had the necessary votes ,  it would truly belong on the bottom 100 .   
0	i too like dafoe as an actor but i wasted a few hours of my life actually watching this film ,  i still cant believe i managed to watch it in its entirety .  was there actually a point to the film ?  ,  and the ending ,  well ,  im glad i never paid to see this awful pointless piece of pathetic excuse of a film !   im not sure without hunting the facts out but is dafoe married or seeing the awful actress in this film in real life ,  if so was it an attempt to kick start her career ?  ,  if so im afraid it must have failed .  .   i post this in the hope i can actually put someone off watching this film ,  even if 1 person takes heed of my comments and decides they would much rather watch paint drying i will feel i have made some good in the world ,  if only i had had the same advice .  .  . 
1	this isn't as violent as i was expecting which makes the violent scenes appear all the more brutal and effective .   there are a lot of twists and turns and back stabbing and double crossing all the way through the film making it hard to know who's side a particular character is on .   the plot is pacey with some good dialogue and character development and gives an interesting view of the workings of the triad gang it follows .   the violence when it comes is brutal ,  no guns or martial art scenes with special effects ,  this is believable in your face violence and for all the dialogue you are never allowed forget that the triad is a violent criminal organisation .   the ending is surprising but thoroughly consistent and believable . 
1	this film has great acting ,  great photography and a very strong story line that really makes you think about who you are ,  how you define yourself ,  how you fit in ,  whether you accept to play a role or break free .  .  .  there already are excellent comments dealing with these aspects .  i want to comment on the formal setting of the film .  basically ,  it's two people on a roof .  there is unity of place and time ,  with 2 protagonists ,  and the radio acting as the choir .  many directors have turned greek tragedies into film ,  many directors have filmed contemporary stories as if they were a greek tragedy ,  but no director ,  in my opinion ,  has succeeded as admirably as ettore scola in approaching the purity and force of the great greek tragedies both in story line and formal setting .  a masterpiece . 
1	hmmm ,  yeah this episode is extremely underrated .   even though there is a lot of bad writing and acting at parts .  i think the good over wins the bad .    i love the origami parts and the big 'twist' at the end .  i absolutely love that scene when michelle confronts tony .  it's actually one of my favorite scenes of season 1 .    for some reason ,  people have always hated the reincarnation episodes ,  yet i have always liked them .  they're not the best ,  in terms of writing .  but the theme really does interest me ,   i'm gonna give it a three star ,  but if the writing were a little more consistent i'd give it four . 
1	this is the moving tale of scotland's legendary hero ,  rob roy ,  and his battles with the feudal landowners .  like braveheart to which it is frequently compared ,  it is not very historical .  despite their primarily fictional nature ,  i rate both of these movies highly and would be hard pressed to choose between the two .  the 13 century william wallace is ,  as others have noted ,  a larger than life national figure ,  while the early 18th century rob roy comes across as an honourable but ordinary scotsman .   the story revolves around a clan chieftain ,  robert roy mcgregor ,  who lives in a scottish highland cottage with his wife mary and their two young sons .  as the movie begins ,  he and his fellow clansmen are hunting down some thieves who have stolen the local lord's cattle .  rob roy then wishes to improve the living conditions of his people so arranges to borrow one thousand scottish pounds from a local noble ,  the marquis of montrose ,  in order to buy cattle to herd to market .  he temporarily entrusts this money to his friend ,  alan mcdonald .  when both mcdonald and the money turn up missing ,  rob roy finds himself in conflict with montrose as well as his despicable protégé ,  archibald cunningham ,  and his sleazy factor ,  killearn .  rob roy's honour is also tested when montrose seeks to involve him in false testimony against his rival ,  the duke of argyle ,  whom he wishes to accuse of being a jacobite .   the charismatic liam leeson is brilliant as the kilted highlander rob roy ,  an intelligent ,  virile ,  and noble hero and a man whose sense of honour is pivotal to this tale .  personally ,  i feel that this is neeson's best performance ,  his brogue  ( albeit irish )  adding authenticity for the average viewer .  rob roy is a stubborn ,  proud ,  courageous ,  and honest man whose word can be trusted .  he is a loving husband & father ,  and also touchingly loyal to his friend ,  mcdonald ,  who is accused of robbing him .    tim roth masterfully portrays his major adversary and surely one of the most heinous and sadistic cinematic villains ,  archibald cunningham ,  an egotistical ,  ruthless strutting peacock .  he is very effeminate for someone who makes it his major business to ravish the local women ,  whether willing or otherwise .  the pathetic cunningham himself constantly refers to the fact that he is a bastard unaware of his own father's identity ,  though this hardly justifies his horrendous misdeeds of murder ,  rape ,  and thievery .  also ,  he mercilessly casts aside the young servant girl ,  betty ,  after she becomes pregnant with his child ,  resulting in her suicide .  john hurt plays the arrogant and foppish montrose ,  who is eventually implied to be cunningham's father .   the movie is essentially the very believable love story between an ordinary man and his wife ,  beautifully depicting the passionate relationship between rob roy and mary .  those who question the presence of passion within marriage should watch this husband and wife !  i think the phrase used by this pair ,  'how fine you are to me .  .  . ' is surely one of the most beautiful expressions of love in all cinema .    the most compelling performance is possibly by jessica lange as rob's wife ,  mary mcgregor .  lacking make up ,  she has the pretty but natural look of a sturdy peasant wife and mother .  the actress brings great courage and dignity to her role when she is brutally raped by the despicable cunningham ,  while the disgusting killearn looks on .  her dialogue is plain spoken but filled with pride and grace .  i give hollywood its due that for once they showed just enough in the rape scene to reveal its cruelty as well as mary's pain and humiliation ,  but nothing intended to sensationalize .  their kinsman ,  alastair mcgregor ,  shows emotional anguish when he learns of mary's rape ,  and further torment when she swears him to secrecy never to reveal to her husband her violation by cunningham .    of course this film features the beautiful scenery of the scottish highlands ,  also lavish period costumes and appropriate musical scoring .  there are no grand battle scenes as in braveheart ,  but continuous engaging action and a particularly gripping sword fight in the final duel between rob roy and cunningham .  this is a captivating movie featuring both tense action and a beautiful love tale . 
1	this movie is very entertaining ,  and any critique is based on personal preferences - not the films quality .  other than the common excessive profanity in some scenes by murphy ,  the film is a great vehicle for his type of humor .  it has some pretty good special effects ,  and exciting action scenes .   as a finder of lost children ,  murphy's character starts off looking for a missing girl ,  which leads him on the path for which others believe he was  " chosen "  - - to protect the golden child .  the young boy is born as an enlightened one ,  destined to save the world from evil forces ,  but whose very life is in danger ,  if not for the help of murphy ,  and his beautiful ,  mysterious and mystical helper/guide/protector .   also ,  there are moments of philosophical lessons to challenge the audience members who are interested in pondering deep thoughts .  one such scene is where the golden child ,  that murphy's character is solicited to protect ,  is tested by the monks of the mountain temple .  an elderly monk presents a tray of ornamental necklaces for the child to choose from ,  and the child is tested on his choice .   this is a fantasy/comedy that is based on the notion that there are both good and evil forces in our world of which most people are completely unaware .  as we accept this premise of the plot ,  we must let go of our touch with a perceived daily reality ,  and prepare for the earth and walls to crumble away ,  and reveal a realm of evil just waiting to destroy us .   this is an excellent movie ,  with a good plot ,  fine acting ,  and for the most part ,  pretty decent dialogue combining a serious topic with a healthy balance of martial art fighting ,  and eddie murphy humor . 
1	franco proves ,  once again ,  that he is the prince of surreal & erotic cinema .  true ,  much of his work can be viewed as entertaining sleaze but with succubus  ( necronomicon )  he shows what he is truly capable of when he lets his warped creativity run riot and gives us a film that is both hypnotic and enigmatic whilst still maintaining the delirious eroticism intrinsic in his work .  jerry van rooyen's splendid score pulsates as the viewer is thrown from one bizarre scenario to another as we follow the trials of a striptease artist  ( reynaud )  who may be schizophrenic ,  or may indeed  ( as one mysterious character states )  be a devil ,  attempt to come to terms with the world she inhabits .  a beautiful and enigmatic piece of cinema highly recommended to anybody with even a passing interest in alternative cinema . 
1	first of all ,  this movie is 34 minutes long ,  which means you could watch it three times in a row and still have spent less time than you would have watching most other movies .  second of all--you need to do this .  this sensational short film explores the potential of animation through a world of playful or horrifying but always powerful images .  cats riding in and drinking out of a water elephant ,  a circus featuring a bird that has consumed the sky ,  and pigs eating their own fried flesh--that's only the beginning .  the scenes and images ,  extraordinary on their own ,  flow together without obvious causal links in a way that demands re-watching .  furthermore ,  the dvd includes an amazing director's commentary ,  which ,  given the extremely spare dialog ,  only enhances the viewing .  the commentary gives a few interpretations of scenes ,  but also provides priceless quotes on the crafting of cat soup ,  along the lines of :   " well ,  the artists were asking what we should do in this scene ,  but i didn't know myself ,  so its hard to say why it turned out as it did "   ( that's a bad paraphrase by the way )  .  also ,  the sound throughout the film is very high quality ,  very precise ,  and very moody .  in all ,  the absolute minimum viewing experience should go as follows :   first viewing :  watch the dvd without the commentary .  second viewing :  watch the dvd with the commentary .  third viewing :  rewatch without the commentary .   once you've watched it three times ,  however ,  you're not going to stop there .  .  . 
1	one of the most beautiful movies ever made in ex yu . story is very familiar to people in ex yul because generation after war used to live in the same way . people in the west cant imagine how political situation in our country affect people . the plot is in the 50 "  , when josip broz tito said no to the sssr and politbiro and because of that our borders becomes open for western influence . but , in a country were people didn't had much money jeans was only ideal and friendship was everything . the friendship between for young people an a girl was so strong that after 40 years of their emigration from yu is still alive . they get together after all this years on ester " s funeral and they start to remember of their childhood , before their went to the emigration and become successful people . 
1	another demonstration of kurosawa's genius ,  his first colour film is a darkly surreal look into the tragic lives of tokyo slum dwellers ,  essentially a series of interweaving vignettes depicting several groups of people eking out a perilous existence in a harsh and uncaring post-war shanty town .  swinging from comedy to tragedy and back ,  this film shows how people deal with the worst kind of life each in their own way ,  mostly retreating into themselves and living in the fantasy worlds of their own heads ,  withdrawing emotionally from those around them or drowning themselves in alcohol .  mixing kitchen-sink realism with kabuki-esque theatrics ,  kurosawa toys expertly with the emotions of his audience ,  drawing tears and laughter with equal deftness .  a wonderful ,  draining experience . 
1	i imagine victorian literature slowly sinking into the mire of the increasingly distant past ,  pulled down by the weight of its under-skirts .  along comes television :  at its best ,  it has a redemptive power ,  and with dramatisations like those the bbc produce so finely ,  victorian literature gets a new stab at life .  the religious themes ,  the moral overtones ,  may be increasingly ill at ease in a world no longer easily shocked ,  and acquainted with cohabitation ,  affairs and domestic violence .  but those old ,  well-told stories have enduring power ,  and this is one's a hidden gem .   it's hard to gauge today just how forceful ,  feminist and extraordinary ann bronte's masterpiece ,   " the tenant of wildfell hall "  ,  actually was .  emerging from the primeval slime of restrictive corsets  bodily ,  mental ,  societal  her heroine ,  helen huntingdon ,  escapes a miserable marriage ,  flees brutality and alcoholism ,  braves not only her abusive husband's fury ,  but society's pinched intolerance and malicious gossip ,  to wreak change in her life .  she pays a price ;  but retains her self-respect ;  she falls in love along the way ;  she emerges battered but victorious ,  and strong .  i just love watching women like these on screen .   the actors are superb  the best brits have to offer .  the love story is beautifully handled ,  with real passion and feeling by well-matched actors .  tara fitzgerald inhabits every aspect of the complicated heroine ,  and as has been said here by other reviewers ,  no less sharply defined and beautiful a face could survive that petrifying hairstyle .  toby stephens ,  striking sparks off her ,  contributes just the right combination of headstrong ,  handsome youth and passionate ,  yearning vulnerability .  rupert graves  ( one of my favourite british actors ever )  enjoys himself as the charismatic villain  ( so much so that you're almost with him at the end .  no one's perfect )  .  the supporting cast ably create a world into which you sink without feeling that coarse compromises have been made to modern tastes ,  and without having felt preached to .  another bbc classic ,  highly recommended :  this is how romantic literature should be dramatised . 
0	i couldn't believe it .  i had to rub my eyes a few times .  was it true ?    yes ,  there were billy dee williams ,  jeff conaway ,  maxwell caulfield and tracy scoggins - all of them have some manner of talent but here they all were in what basically adds up to a cinemax-style skin flick set on board a spaceship !   sad as it is ,   " alien intruder "  tries to be unique ,  with a computer virus/alien demon/harpy/whatever else you want to call her named ariel  ( scoggins )  infiltrating this sort-of high-tech virtual reality station on board a spaceship where four men are allowed to live out their fantasies as the system is over-seen by their captain  ( williams )  .   interesting ?  maybe ,  but here everything just plays out like a well-padded episode of  " red shoe diaries "  .  williams out-classes everything right and left ,  and looks like he'd rather be doing anything else ,  anywhere else .  ah ,  the things people do for money .  .  .  .   the fx are pretty static ,  maybe even less than what you'd expect for a straight-to-video cheapie like this .  unfortunately ,  even the female nudity is less than you'd expect .  sexual innuendo is the real star here and ,  of course ,  it gets all the best scenes .   if you like a movie that's all tease and no brains ,  check out  " alien intruder "  .  of course ,  you'll probably have to look no further than cinemax at 2 or 3 in the morning .   no stars ,  not even for what star power this flick can muster .   leave this one lost in space . 
1	a delightful little thriller opens with trevor howard in his jag convertible and ends on a dockside in liverpool .  it's all thrills and spills as the ex-spy has to restart his career just as he's getting some serious r & r cataloguing butterflies  ( how british is that ?  )  .   trevor howard and jean simmons frolic from london to newcastle-upon-tyne to liverpool  ( via ullswater )  - he's just been thrown out of mi5 or something ,  and she ,  you guessed it ,  is on the run ,  wrongly accused of murder .  there's seedy docks ,  rolling lake district hills ,  sheep ,  country pubs ,  coppers getting lost ,  waterfalls ,  a bunch of amateur cyclists ,  rooftop chases ,  and lots of chinamen  ( don't ask )  ,  and it's all very hitchcocky and hannayesque .  .  .    .  . and a smashing example of british noir .  .  . 
1	this ,  and  " hidden fortress "  are the kurosawa's that are most dear to me .  i don't hand out 10's like candy ,  but this certainly deserved it ,  if anything .  even though it's quite long  ( like all kurosawa's pretty much are )  it concurred the problem which bugs me with most of his films ;  the storyline is often too loose and slowly evolving ,  containing scenes that are unnecessary or just lenghtened too much without any real purpose to the storyline or the character description .  dodesukaden delivered to me the same experience that for example  " hidden fortress "  did ;  despite its lenght ,  there wasn't a single minute i would cut out .   this is also a very unusual kurosawa film in a way ,  it has no storyline ,  but many little independent stories which are based more to the character description than storyline ,  unlike any other kurosawa-film i have seen so far .  it also leans much on the dialogue ,  which he uses brilliantly  ( especially in the story between the father and the son planning their  " new house "  )  .    still the thing that makes this one a masterpiece is how the subject being so tragic as it is ,  is managed to be described so humanely and sympathetically ,  without pointing fingers at anybody at any point .  from the beginning to the end it delivers the whole emotional scale from laughter to tears in perfect balance . 
1	after not having much luck at selling his screenplays to the new movie industry during the first decade of the 20th century ,  in 1908 playwright d . w .  griffith got the job that would make him a legend :  he was hired by the biograph company as a director of movies .  it wasn't really what griffith had expected when he decided to enter the movie business ,  but he accepted the job ,  and in less than a year he became biograph's most successful director thanks to his original approach to film-making and the wild inventive of his narrative .  many years later ,  he would direct  " the birth of a nation "  in 1915 ,  the movie that would revolutionize film-making and make him one of cinema's first recognized authors ;  however ,  a lot of what would make him a great filmmaker can be found in the many short films he made for biograph company in the early years of his career .  1909's  " the sealed room "  is one of those ,  and also one of the few horror movies of that very first decade of the 20th century .    " the sealed room "  is a story set in the 16th century in which a count  ( arhtur v .  johnson )  has built a windowless room in his castle .  it is a small yet nice and very cozy room ,  as it is meant to be used to enjoy the love and company of his wife ,  the countess  ( marion leonard )  in a more private way .  however ,  the count doesn't know that his wife is not exactly faithful ,  as she is infatuated with the minstrel  ( henry b .  walthall )  at court ,  with whom she is having an affair .  as soon as the count gets busy with his own business ,  the countess calls the minstrel and both lovers go to enjoy the count's new room .  when the count returns ,  he discovers she is missing and begins to suspect ,  finally discovering the two lovers in his room ;  but instead of making a scene ,  he prefers to remain hidden as he decides that there is a better punishment for his unfaithful wife :  to seal the windowless room with the couple inside .   written by griffiths' regular collaborator frank e .  woods ,   " the sealed room "  takes elements from edgar allan poe's  " the cask of amontillado "  and mainly honoré de balzac's  " la grande breteche "  to create a haunting gothic melodrama based on the themes of treachery and sadism .  despite having a runtime of 11 minutes ,  woods' screenplay develops the story in a very good way ,  and plays remarkably well with the horror elements of the story .  while a melodrama at heart ,  woods focus on the character of the count and his sadism creates one of the best horror characters of these early era .   " the sealed room "  is definitely a very simple and basic story ,  but woods handling of the dark and morbid thematic of its plot makes the story a very entertaining film that was very different than most griffith's melodramas .   in  " the sealed room "  ,  griffith uses his talents to experiment with tension and suspense in a different way than his usual .  while he often played with editing to create thrillers that excited his audience ,  in this movie his focus was to create desperation and horror ,  playing with the inherent feeling of claustrophobia that the source stories had .  it is interesting how the story starts as another of his melodramas and slowly the pacing becomes faster as the horror themes begin to dominate the plot ,  culminating in his great use of editing for the final scenes .  not being a movie where camera tricks are essential ,  what shines the most in  " the sealed room "  is griffith's talent to direct his actors ,  as the legendary filmmaker manages to bring the best out of his cast with his usual natural style far removed from the staginess that was the norm in his day .   as usual ,  the cast was comprised of usual collaborators of griffith ,  starting with arthur v .  johnson as the count .  johnson gives a great performance and truly conveys the character's transition from loving husband to sadistic monster .  his performance is not without a touch of overacting ,  but actually that adds realism to the character's exaggerated personality .  as the countess ,  marion leonard looks very good and is also very effective in her acting ,  conveying a natural charm that makes hard not to sympathize with her in her treachery .  finally ,  the legendary henry b .  walthall appears as the handsome minstrel ,  and while far from being one of his best performances ,  he manages to give a proficient acting that also adds a nice touch of comedy to the film .  while not of real importance to the plot ,  it's nice to see other members of griffith's stock company in the background ,  like his wife linda arvidson and a young mary pickford as nobles at court .   while not exactly a masterpiece ,   " the sealed room "  is a notable exercise of editing to create suspense and tension like griffith used to do in those days .  the movie has very good set design and while of a very low budget ,  griffith's care for details makes it look very convincing and works perfectly along with his directing style .  the change of focus to horror makes it to stand out among other of his films from that era ,  and johnson's performance as the sadistic count makes it worth a watch .  while griffith will always be remembered for his highly influential  ( and controversial )   " the birth of a nation "  ,  the early short films he made before it really give a good idea of the development of the techniques and the style that would make him a legend .  simple yet elegant ,   " the sealed room "  is a fun movie to watch and one of the few horrors of the first decade of the 20th century .  7/10
1	petter mattei's  " love in the time of money "  is a visually stunning film to watch .  mr .  mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations .  this is a movie that seems to be telling us what money ,  power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter .    this being a variation on the arthur schnitzler's play about the same theme ,  the director transfers the action to the present time new york where all these different characters meet and connect .  each one is connected in one way ,  or another to the next person ,  but no one seems to know the previous point of contact .  stylishly ,  the film has a sophisticated luxurious look .  we are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat .   the only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits .  a big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment ,  as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter .   the acting is good under mr .  mattei's direction .  steve buscemi ,  rosario dawson ,  carol kane ,  michael imperioli ,  adrian grenier ,  and the rest of the talented cast ,  make these characters come alive .   we wish mr .  mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work . 
1	an absolutely brilliant show .  the second season began where the first ended ,  with much mystery .  suspense in most ,  if not all episodes and mystery everywhere .  one that made me think and think again .  it's truly amazing how the writer can come out with all the connections and link all the characters together and combine all these elements to make the lives of the characters in the show so meaningful .  never fail to excites and i am looking forward to the new season .  hopefully more secrets will be reveal and at the same time ,  more mystery to be solved .  good selection of cast too for this show ,  fit the characters perfectly .  really can't wait to finally discover the secret .  hopefully all the hype won't spoil the ending . 
1	 " a mouse in the house "  is a very classic cartoon by tom & jerry ,  faithful to their tradition but with jokes of its own .  it is hysterical ,  hilarious ,  very entertaining and quite amusing .  artwork is of good quality either .   this short isn't just about tom trying to catch jerry .  butch lives in the same house and he's trying to catch the mouse too ,  because «there's only going to be one cat in this house in the morning -- and that's the cat that catches the mouse» .   if you ask me ,  there are lots of funny gags in this cartoon .  the funniest for me are ,  for example ,  when mammy two shoes sees the two lazy cats sleeping and says sarcastically «i'm glad you're enjoying the siesta» and that she hopes they're satisfied because she ain't ,  making the two cats gasp .  another funny gag is when tom disguises himself as mammy two shoes and slams butch with a frying pan and then butch does the same trick to tom .  of course that ,  even funnier than this ,  is when the real mammy two shoes appears and both  ( dumb !  )  cats think they are seeing each other disguised as mammy and then they both attack her on the  " rear "  - lol .  naturally that she gets mad and once she gets mad ,  she isn't someone to mess with .  but even jerry doesn't win this time ,  because he is expelled by her too . 
1	i first saw this movie when i was about 10 years old .  unfortunately i could not watch it to the end because it was aired late at night .  now i bought it on dvd because i can remember that i liked it .   this is really not an ordinary horror movie .  it has some horror elements but i rather categorize it as fantasy .  i liked it but i hoped for a bit more horror and scary scenes .  especially the scene when anna's dad comes into the paperhouse trying to kill her is a bit short .   now to the plot .  this movie is about a young girl named anna who gets ill .  while she is ill and has to lie in her bed because of her high fewer she turns on to finishing her drawing about a house - the paperhouse .  when she fells a sleep ,  which often strangely happens just immediately ,  she finds herself near the house on a big green field .  she realizes that the house is exactly like the one she has drawn and that every new detail also appears in her dreams .  one day she draws a boy into the house to have somebody to talk to .  as she forgets to draw his legs  ( because he is sitting behind a window )  the boy cannot walk .  later she is being told by the doctor ,  that a boy also has this strange disease and she realizes that with the boy she has drawn ,  she also got that boy into her disturbing dreams .  she also notices that it gets harder and harder for her to wake up from her dreams .  as she misses her father who is ofter abroad she draws her father into the house .  she makes a mistake and her father is looking very angry on the painting .  she tries to rubber him out but realizes that she cannot change anything already drawn .  and next time she falls asleep the horror begins .  her father is mad and blind  ( because she draw s*** on his head to mark him as 'invalid' )  and tries to get into the paperhouse and kill anna and his friend .  her dreams became a horrendous nightmare .  they manage to escape and to kill her father and anna can finally wake up .  than anna finds her self in the hospital where her parents are sitting beside her bed .  the doctors thought that she fell into a coma or so .  they tell anna that the other boy died and that they want to travel to the ocean to get over those tragical happenings .  anna draws a watchtower and notices that the same watchtower can be found near the hotel they traveled to .  she runs to the watchtower and meets the boy  ( i am just not mentioning his name because i cannot remember it and do not want to go back to the previous html page )  and can say good bye to him and forget those terrible dreams forever .   there were a few thing i did not understand in the movie .  first of all it was the ending which i absolutely dislike .  i think it is too long while the main part of the movie becomes a bit too short .  how does the boy fly a helicopter and speak to anna as he is supposed to be dead ?  why did you have to put such a stupid radio on the wall ?  i hated that scene it was so dumb to me .  it almost ruined the main horror scene .   things i liked were the scene with the photograph of anna's dad which was the first real scary and horror scene .  i liked the boy .  the actor was awesome .  he was even better than anna .  i also liked how anna tries to get her father out of the painting while she is asleep and how she is looking for it in the garbage .   overall a good movie .  i give it a 8 out of 10 . 
1	in the ten years since wildside aired ,  nothing has really come close to its quality in local production .  this includes the two series of the enjoyable but overrated underbelly ,  which have brought to life events in the recent criminal history of both sydney and melbourne .  the miniseries blue murder  ( which also starred tony martin ,  but as someone on the other side of the law )  may be the exception .   wildside is currently being repeated late at night on the abc .  having not watched the show in quite a while ,  i'm still impressed by its uncompromising story lines and very human characters .  the cast is excellent :  tony martin as a detective haunted by the disappearance of his son ,  rachael blake  ( who later hooked up with martin in real life )  as a community worker struggling with alcoholism ,  and alex dimitriades as a young cop whose vice is gambling .  equally good support roles are provided by aaron pederson ,  jessica napier ,  mary coustas  ( yes ,  effie herself )  ,  and a young abbie cornish .   the abc inexplicably released only the first three episodes on dvd a couple of years ago .  the logic of this sort of marketing is beyond me ,  but i'm guessing it may have something to do with licensing disagreements with the original producers .   a great series which has aged remarkably well .  here's hoping the abc's dvd department gets its act together .    ( according to a moderator on an abc message board ,  some sort of further dvd release is due in december 2009 ) 
1	this film tells the story of a romance between albert einstien niece and a gas station attendant .  in order to get the two together ,  einstien agrees to help ed ( hudsucker proxy's tim robbins )  learn to act more intelligent .  this impresses catherine  ( meg ryan )  .  unfortunately einstien goes too far and ed is considered to be a genius .  hilarity ensues .  not to be missed .  filmed in mercer county new jersey at princeton university ,  lawrenceville prep school  ( doubling for princeton university )  as well as a beautiful vintage gas station in hopewell . 
0	while watching this movie i got sick .  i have been grewing up with pippi and every time was a real pleasure .  when my wife came to sweden she was looking at the oldies and had a real good laugh .  but this american version should be renamed and never be shown again .  it is terrible from beginning to it's end .  how can they manage to make it soo bad .  well i guess someone blames the translation ha ha ha .  .  but they are never close to pippi .  may this movie never been seen again and never sent out on a broadcast .  burn the movie and save the kids .  if you want to look at pippi then look at the original movie and have a good laugh .  we love pippi inger nilsson ,  sorry tami erin you will never stand up to be pippi .  .  oh yes .  .  when read the  " spoilers "  explanation ,   " 'spoiling' a surprise and robbing the viewer of the suspense and enjoyment of the film .  "  well i guess the director stands for this .  .  .  you are looking at this movie at your own risk .  .  it is really a waste of time .  .  . 
1	it's a colorful slasher movie .  that's about it .   it has the mystery element that scream made so popular in slasher movies ,  but i never care for such things .  figuring out who's the bad guy is not that interesting considering the clues are all misleading anyway .   the death scenes were inventive and gorey ,  bringing back memories of 80's horror movies like friday the 13th .    another nice thing about this movie is that it's hard to pinpoint the surviving girl ,  unlike in scream and ikwydls where it was obvious .    people who don't like slasher movies won't like this movie .  as simple as that .  i truly enjoyed it and i plan to watch it again while waiting for more of the same .    --mb
1	this is a visual adaptation of manga with very little dialogue .  what dialogue there is appears in word baloons as it would in the manga .  the plot of this is existent but only vaguely accounted for .  there is an issue of the manga on which this is based available in english in the blast books collection ,  'comics underground japan' ,  and it has actual captioned dialogue that explains the plot a bit more than here .  i recommend checking that volume out if you liked this ,  as it explains some of the  " plot "  of the movie ,  which is otherwise inexplicable .  animation wise this is pretty decent ,  good unintrusive use of computers and the images are for the most part realized well .  it jumps in and out of episodes ,  as the characters ,  a cat and his brain-dead older sister cat wander in and out of a series of odd images :  a boat ,  a circus ,  a desert .  for a mere half hour they go through a number of semi-plots and settings ,  which leads me to believe that the director chose a number of issues of the long-running manga to adapt at random ,  but primarilly selected visually .  knowing what's going on might somewhat increase appreciation .  this reminds me mostly of the kind of stuff they used to play on the mtv show ,  cartoon sushi ,  in particular a short that features a cat chasing a man's severed butt-cheek around the house .  only in this case the cats resemble hello kitty more and their adventure is expanded to include death and reincarnation and a number of other themes [though not all that easy to tell what's going on] .  the dvd of this has director's commentary and a  " making of "  features ,  but i cant comment on those because i didnt get around to them .  i'm giving this a 8/10 for now ,  here isnt much to compare it to in anime ,  and i hope for more like this . 
0	now ,  i hired this movie because brad dourif was in it .  he is an excellent actor ,  brilliant in everything .  .  . except this movie .  and i think that was only because he realized how stupid this movie was ,  and didn't bother with a good performance .  this movie is a unintentional-comedy .  some of the lines just crack me up .  and them there are some lines that make no sense ,  and it seems like tobe hooper just throw lines in without thinking about the plot .  oh !  btw the plot is bad !  but it one of those films that is taht bad that its actually painful to watch .  i recommend this only for big brad dourif fans ,  or fans of any of the other actors ,  because the plot is pathetic . 
1	i read several mixed reviews and several of them downright trashed the movie .  i originally became interested in this project because it was being directed by tony scott and i have become very interested in his work after man on fire had such a profound impact on me .  before i start my review ,  let me first say this .  .  . it's wonderful to see that this movie could have been told in a boring and ordinary manner ,  yet the writers and scott chose a different approach .   plot :   simply stated ,  it's not boring .  most hollywood movies give 'tried and true' plots that they know will connect with people ,  often ensuring the audiences acceptance of the film and creating a higher probability of profit .  this plot was one of the more interesting ones i had seen in a while .  just for reference ,  i recently watched 'the weather man' and 'lord of war' and while i will say that these movies are excellent ,  and i enjoyed them both tremendously ,  both the plots in these movies are boring and they are told exactly how you would expect them to be told .  they don't take any chances whatsoever ,  and they are extremely predictable after you've watched a fair amount of american films .  domino's plot is both interesting and told in a manner that keeps you thinking ,   " oh man ,  they're screwed now "  .  and i feel that has been lacking in a lot of recent films .  it has a lot of depth to it ,  in my opinion ,  and gives you plenty of things to question while watching it .  overall ,  this is what kept me so interested in the movie .   characters :   i felt that the characters were accurate .  knightley did a wonderful job of portraying a beautiful woman ,  who was anything but on the inside and wanted to be viewed as what she was .  it was obvious that she wanted to prove herself and she took whatever means she had to accomplish that .   choco was also very believable ,  his use of spanish in inappropriate situations ,  his reactions to domino's lack of affection ,  as well as his jealousy issues within the team .  .  . they all rang true to me ,  which made me feel that his character was that much more realistic .   rourke's character was the least interesting to me ,  but it still rang true to me .  he seemed like an ordinary guy ,  trying to make ends meet .  i hope that's what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with him because that's what i got out of it .  he did a very good job of showing ed in an average joe kind of way that has made his mistakes ,  yet is still trying to live .   claremont/ladies :  i believe that they provided much needed 'heart' to the story .  they weren't just people who are out getting money to buy a bentley ,  these were real people who had a real problem and they sought others mean to accomplish that goal .  you could empathize with them because ,  to them ,  this child's illness was a problem with no other solution .  these characters were supposed to show real people who are less fortunate who got into this mess because they needed help .   the mobsters :  they made the story seem sinister in a way that only the mob can .  and i really liked that part .  they also padded the story with small intricacies that made the plot that much more interesting .   christopher walken/90210 guys :   they provided the comic relief in an otherwise very serious movie .  from walken's awkward statements to the ceaseless references to the 90210 guys being has-beens .  their involvement in the movie only made it that much more enjoyable .   cinematography .  .  .  . yes .  .  .  . the cinematography .  this is where this movie seems to have lost a lot of potential fans .  but in my opinion i thought it was genius ,  the use of the camera to translate the mood of the current situation was extremely effective in my opinion .  i considered it a method that was properly realized but could always use improvement ,  just like anything else .  i both applaud and congratulate scott ,  the editor ,  the cinematographer and the director of photography on taking some real chances with this movie .  not only did they go far and above with its presentation ,  they went that much further .  the use of colors ,  both extremely light and extremely dark provided the 'look' of the film with a sinister and grungy look that accurately depicts the life of the mob ,  bounty hunters and the less fortunate in a manner that show that their life isn't as peachy or 'clean' as everyone else .  if you notice ,  in times of less stress or conflict ,  there were very few camera tricks if any at all .  this shows that scott and his crew were trying to achieve something with this look and weren't just doing it for the heck of it .  i realize that most people who watched this movie weren't expecting it and it cause many of them to be turned off to this film but i think it was great that scott took this approach .  hollywood films have grown predictable and bland .  most of them are shot in the same manner with the same twists and turns .  and i'm glad that scott tried to make something different .   granted ,  this movie isn't for everyone ,  but to say it's trash and has nothing to offer is completely missing the point .  i thoroughly enjoyed this film and i'm glad that i spent the money for it .  i would recommend this to all ,  but i'm sure it will only hit a chord with few .  i must agree with an earlier poster when he said that many of those who refuse to see outside the 'sphere of mtv' won't appreciate this movie ,  but i think many people will .  we should all try to enjoy it for the fact that scott and co .  took some chances and tried to deliver something that was different and unique .  and with that in mind ,  i think he succeeded tremendously . 
1	this film plays really well with an audience .  especially once the chase begins .  plus ,  trevor howard with his sensible ,  smart charms and jean simmons with her innocent demeanor and piercing eyes are terrific together .   the film starts as a psychological drama but after the murder it segues into a chase thriller as the two leads head for the border .  some may think the chase is superfluous but actually the chase is essential because it aids in clearing the mind of the jean simmons character by getting her out of the oppressive household ,  plus it helps bring out the real killer - who is suddenly put into such a position that they have to finish the job .  the killer rightly believed that once the simmons character was arrested she would be put away .  and it is true that her lack of control in the household - as well as evidence pointing her way - there is no way she would have gotten out of the murder charge .  the chase that ensues helps bring out the truth .   this is an entertaining film .  seek it out if you can find it . 
0	if it wasn't for the performances of barry diamond and art evans as the clueless stoners ,  i would have no reason to recommend this to anyone .   the plot centers around a 10 year high school reunion ,  which takes place in a supposed abandon high school ( looks more like a prop from a 1950s low budget horror flick )  ,  and the deranged student the class pulled a very traumatizing prank on .  this student desires to kill off the entire class for revenge .   john hughes falls in love with his characters too much ,  as only one student is killed as well as the lunch lady ( goonies' anne ramsey )  .  we're led to believe that the horny coupled gets killed ,  but never see a blasted thing !  this is a horrible movie that continued national lampoon's downward spiral throughout the 80s and 90s . 
1	this movie was nominated for best picture but lost out to casablanca but paul lukas beat out humphrey bogart for best actor .  i don't see why lucile watson was nominated for best supporting actor ,  i just don't think she did a very good job .  bette davis and paul lukas and their three kids are leaving mexico and coming into the united states in the first scene of the movie .  they are going by train to davis's relatives house .  davis and lukas were in the underground to stop the nazis so they are very tired and need rest .  but when they arrive home ,  their is a nazi living there and their's not much either can do about it .  it turns out the nazi only cares about money and is willing to make a deal with lukas .  their is more to the plot but you can find that out for yourself . 
0	what can i say ?  ?  ?  this movie was so dumb & stupid i thought it was a psychotic drag comedy - they should rename it  " bitching pregnant cat fight !  "  what a stupid waste of time  ,  if you want to see ( die die !  !  !   " i want your baby drag queen )  jennifer tilly being her freaky self then just rent out one of the  " chucky "  movie ,  oh ya  ,   " the bride of chucky .  "  it's more fun watching the two ugly plastic dolls  ( one of them jennifer tilly turned into the ugly female version of chucky )  having squeaky plastic rubber sex then watching daryl hannah being pregnant  ,  dumb & stupid ;  & jennifer tilly grinding up her husbang in a food processor reminded me of my mother trying to do house work !  ok it's just bad !  !  ! 
0	ten minutes worth of story stretched out into the better part of two hours .  when nothing of any significance had happened at the halfway point i should have left .  but ,  ever hopeful ,  i stayed .  and left with a feeling of guilt for having wasted the time .  acting was ok ,  but the story line is so transparent and weak .  the script is about as lame as it could get ,  but again ,  stretching out the ten minute plot doesn't leave a whole lot of room for good dialogue . 
1	story of ireland in the 70/s .  this film is a beautiful reconstruction of small time ireland in the 1970/s .  all the gang are there see below .  master boyle  ,  the boys  ,  the cannon  ,  sp o'donnell  ,  senator doogan's daugter  ,  rose  ,  agnes  ,  maura and una .  see this film . feel ireland as it was .   
0	and rent a good horror movie .  it's like the writer had never seen a horror movie before and didn't realize every single thing he wrote was clichéd and hackneyed and has been parodied to perfection in movies like  " scream "  and  " scary movie "  .   in between the scary bits is the most banal and boring dialog ever written .  stupid  " we're going to the prom "  junk .  i wanted to claw my ears off .  honestly ,   " the hills "  has better dialog .   there really was no need to make this movie .  leading lady is uninteresting and i kept thinking  " her ?  really ?  guy is obsessed with her ?  really ?  "    all the characters act in stupid ways ,  including the police .   ( cover the place in teams of 2 !  front and back !  not one sleepy cop sitting in his car with the window rolled down just waiting for his throat to be slashed .  )    the serial killer just swans about murdering everyone he wants without the least bit of problem .  no resistance from victims  ( or doors )  .  nobody has any protection or the least idea of fighting back  ( or flipping the security lock on the hotel room door )  .  the people are like mentally disabled sheep .   by the by ,  if you're a gore fan ,  you'll be disappointed too .  all the killing is kept offscreen and is -- ahem -- tastefully done .   ( so boo hoo for you !  )    none of the killings is the least bit interesting .  most of the time they've already happened by the time we find out .   the only cliché missing was the cat that always pops out in this kind of movies .   " oh kitty !  you scared me !  i thought you were the killer -- aiieeee !  "    and then at the end when it's time for the killer to die -- well ,  let's just say it's the easiest and most obvious choice .  snore .   the audience was jeering and talking back to the screen throughout .  it was too dumb to believe and not really scary enough .  don't encourage this kind of lazy film-making .    ( oh ,  and by the way -- no crowning of a prom king or queen .  no tiara .  no bucket of blood .  )    so save your money and rent  " carrie "  or  " friday the 13th "  or  " halloween "  or  " scream "  or  " scary movie "   ( any of them )  to get a good scare with some original twists . 
1	parker and stone transplant their pacy expletive-ridden humour from their animated masterpiece to a feature length live action film with generally good results .  much of the film is trey and matt running amok with their new toy box .  the plot is simplicity itself :  two average guys invent a new sport ,  a blend of driveway basketball with baseball scoring which becomes a national craze .  along the way they encounter numerous sporting movie cliches and send them up ,  along with any other bit of popular culture that comes into their sights .  it runs like a stretched south park episode ,  with the usual machine-gun dialogue ,  toilet humour and homilies from the heart .   if this film has a weakness it is the association with the team that gave us  " airplane "  and the  " naked gun "  series .  this influence is clearly seen with the heavy use of lame sight gags and the presence of a glossy and rather two-dimensional yasmine bleeth in the role usually given to priscilla presley .  robert vaughn does a little better playing the corporate b**tard that has been his party piece ever since  " bullitt "  and ernest borgnine overacts as only he can ,  but one must admit he's perfect for the role of the lunatic team owner .   for those who haven't noticed yet ,  parker and stone seem to be more comfortable as rock star wannabes than comics .  this manifests in the prominence given to the soundtrack in just about everything they create .  as usual ,  they give a good selection here including the obligatory track by their own ultra-non-pc vehicle dvda .   a special mention must go to dian bachar ,  who deserves some sort of award for enduring the difficult job of playing stan to parker and stone's rampaging pair of cartmans .   in summary ,  this is an entertaining comedy which is held back from its full potential by too much reliance on the  " naked gun/airplane "  formula .  parker and stone could do something truly brilliant  ( or absolutely awful )  if given full control over a future film .  america ,  either lock these guys up or put them in charge . 
1	this movie is an eye opener for those who can only the glamorous lifestyles of the stars .  it tells you how people who would like to do good are not able to .  plus the bomb blast scene is very real .   what you read and are taught just does not happen !  !  !   can raise your bp level by 10%  all actors played their role very well .   some scenes may / could have been avoided to include teenagers .   this movie is quite adult in nature .   not a movie that can be seen with family .   casting is great !  !  ! 
1	i only wish that return of the jedi ,  have been directed by somebody else ,  i mean ,  there is far too much ewoks scenes ,  completely unnecessary .  besides this time our heroes look like different people :  princess leia no longer fights with solo ,  luke looks boring ,  darth vader is not as evil as before ,  and yoda just dies .   but there are many extraordinary things going on this episode that i just can't hate it .   some spoilers 1- jabba the hut 2- the sail barge attack sequence .  3-the emperor  ( now that's evil )  4- the speeders chase at the endor forest .  5-the last battle .  6-the dark side seduction scene .  7-the return of anakin to the good side of the force .  8- and the last celebration .   some of those are so good that they can bring tears to your eyes .  if some scenes would have been cut ,  and another director was hired ,  this would have been as perfect as episode 4 and 5 ,  but still is extraordinary .  9 out of 10 . 
1	though this movie has a first rate roster of fine actors ,  special effects that are excellent ,  and a story line that is full of surprises ,  it wasn't picked up for studio distribution and went directly to dvd .  perhaps it contains too much 'anti-police force' information ,  or perhaps it is juts one too many action flicks released during a glut ,  but whatever the reason the big screens missed the opportunity ,  fortunately the new concept of releasing direct to dvd allows us to enjoy it .   the theme is old :  rookie reporter uncovers an inner circle of cops that are corrupt - in this case the f . r . a . t .   ( first response assault and tactical )  team ,  a group of well trained policeman created to clean up the mythical city of edison from its low point of crime ,  drugs ,  prostitution etc .  working undercover the temptation of pocketing the confiscated goods and money proves too much of an opportunity and now ,  15 years after its formation ,  frat is responsible for murder ,  drug trafficking ,  terrorizing innocent people etc .  the lead dog is lazerov  ( dylan mcdermott ,  who makes a terrifyingly real gangster !  )  and his partner rafe deed  ( ll cool j ,  even more buff than usual and proving he can be a sensitive actor )  .  reporter pollack  ( justin timberlake )  catches wind of a 'bad mistake' and reports his theory of fraud and corruption to his paper's boss ashford  ( the always reliably fine morgan freeman )  .  gradually polack convinces ashford and subsequently wallace  ( kevin spacey ,  also a consistently fine character actor )  and they aid pollack in this investigative reporting .  the closer pollack gets to the truth the more surprises and bad incidents happen and the story runs pall mall toward a series of unexpected results .   timberlake lacks the charisma to carry the lead ,  especially in the company of such seasoned actors .  but ll cool j ,  freeman ,  spacey ,  and mcdermott keep the well-oiled machine of a movie rolling to the very end .  no ,  it is not a great movie ,  but it is one that makes for an edge of the seat action flick with a message .  grady harp
1	how can anyone not love this movie  ?  i think it's a hilarious spoof of all the old gangster movies ;  if you've never seen them ,  watch this instead .  michael keaton has a ball in this role as anything goes .  one guy mangles the english language everytime he talks and griffin dunn plays a clueless d . a .  ,  but my favorite role has got to be joe piscopo .  he has all the best lines .  danny devito ,  alan hale ,  ray walston are in this star-studded movie that lampoons gangsters a lot funnier than  " mafia "  did for the criminal underground . 
1	the shining starts with jack torrance  ( jack nicholson )  driving to an isolated hotel named the 'overlook' situated high in the colorado mountains for an interview with it's manager stuart ullman  ( barry nelson )  about becoming the winter caretaker .  ullman tells jack that he will be responsible for the basic upkeep of the hotel but will be almost totally isolated from the rest of the world for six months as the harsh winter sets in .  together with his wife wendy  ( shelley duvall )  & young son danny  ( danny lloyd )  jack moves into the hotel & at first everything seems fine ,  it's a beautiful hotel ,  absolutely huge & whatever they need is at their disposal .  however the overlook hotel has a murky past with a previous caretaker murdering his entire family before committing suicide & danny has the ability to 'shine' which means he has psychic powers that let him see & hear things 'ordinary' people can't .  as the days ,  weeks & months begin to pass jack become more & more insane ,  danny keeps 'seeing' things & people while wendy becomes frantic as she doesn't have a clue what's happening to her family ,  as a heavy snowstorm leaves them trapped jack finally loses it .  .  .   this english production was co-written ,  co-produced & directed by stanley kubrick & is a fine horror film .  it appears that the shining is another film that exists in two distinct different versions & the one i will be commenting on is the shorter european cut that runs just under 2 hours in length .  the script by kubrick & diane johnson ,  is based on the novel by stephen king which i have not read so i can't compare them ,  goes for psychological horror rather than visual with only one murder during the entire film .  there are very few character's in the shining with jack ,  wendy & danny the only ones that really matter ,  since the film concentrates on them almost exclusively you care for them ,  become involved with them & what they go through .  the pace is somewhat slow but this is one film that didn't feel that long & keeps you interested throughout .  on the negative side i don't think the reasoning behind jack going crazy & wanting to kill his family was strong enough to convince me ,  the fact that jack escapes from the freezer without any explanation bugs me & i don't know if i missed something but that ending didn't make any sense to me whatsoever ,  i'm still trying to work out what that picture is all about !  there is very little in the way of violence or gore ,  a couple of rotten zombie ghosts & someone is killed with an axe but the shining is a horror film that doesn't need to rely on blood & special effects as it has a gripping story .  with a budget of about $19 , 000 , 000 the shining is technically flawless as you would expect from an obsessive filmmaker such as kubrick ,  the cinematography is brilliant with some fantastic free-flowing & smooth steadicam shots as the camera effortlessly follows the character's around the maze of corridors ,  the sets look absolutely real & instead of clichéd old haunted house themes like dark corners ,  basements & cobwebs kubrick brings things right up-to-date with brightly lit corridors ,  massive open expansive spaces & a modern decor  ( well 80's modern ,  just check that red toilet out !  )  .  the acting is good from everyone involved although as usual in horror films the little kid is highly annoying & nicholson seems crazy from the very start .  the shining is an absorbing film that i enjoyed watching although i'm not sure i'd watch it again anytime soon .  for those looking for explosions & fancy special effects you will be disappointed ,  for those looking for a good haunted house type horror with a strong story i definitely think the shining is for you ,  well worth a watch in my humble opinion . 
1	this film was shot on location in gerard gardens in liverpool ,  and was the uk's answer to films such as 'blackboard jungle' .  the film stands the test of time quite well ,  with all the moral stories still  ( or even more )  relevant today .  the film feature some fine performance from some notable british actors such as david mccallum ,  stanley baker ,  peter cushing and anne heywood .  baker plays a liverpool cop assigned to juvenile liaison duties ,  with the premise that if you catch the kids at an early age ,  they will end up being responsible adults .   notable cameos in the film include freddie starr  ( fred fowell )  and melvyn hayes  ( gloria )  .  tsai chin and michael chow play brother and sister  ( they are real life brother and sister )  who are caught up in an arsonists web .  tsai chin is still acting and can be seen in the latest nicole kidman film 'the interpretor' .   violent playground features a gun siege in a school ,  so is unlikely to be shown on tv following similar events in scotland / russia .   i lived in gerard gardens where the film was shot  ( though was not born at the time )  ,  and have fond memories of the area .  i have recently completed a documentary on gerard gardens which includes extracts from 'violent playground' ,  and a small uk film 'coast to coast' which stars lenny henry and pete postlewaite .  the tenements were demolished in 1987 and the films go some way in keeping the memory alive .   there were some complaints from the residents when the film was released ,  as the film portrayed the area in a bad light .  time has helped heal those wounds .   a little gem of a film ,  i would recommend you seek this out
1	an excellent example of  " cowboy noir "  ,  as it's been called ,  in which unemployed michael  ( nicolas cage )  loses out on a job because he insists on being honest  ( he's got a bum leg )  .  with really nothing else he can do ,  he decides that for once he's going to lie .  when he walks into a bar ,  and the owner wayne  ( the late ,  great j . t .  walsh )  mistakes him for a hit-man whom wayne has hired to do in his sexy young wife suzanne  ( lara flynn boyle in fine form )  ,  michael plays along and accepts waynes' money .  *then* he goes to suzanne and informs her of her husbands' intentions ,  and accepts *her* money to get rid of wayne !  if that didn't complicate things enough ,  the real hit-man ,   " lyle from dallas "   ( dennis hopper ,  in a perfect role for him )  shows up and michael is in even more trouble than before .    " red rock west "  gets a lot out of the locations .  director john dahl ,  who co-wrote the script with his brother rick ,  was smart in realizing the potential of a story set in a truly isolated small town that may have seen better days and in which the residents could be involved in any manner of schemes .  it's also an amusing idea of the kind of trouble an honest person could get into if they decided to abandon their principles and give in to any level of temptation .  it's an appreciably dark and twist-laden story with an assortment of main characters that are if not corrupt ,  have at least been morally compromised like michael .  the lighting by cinematographer marc reshovsky is superb in its moodiness ;  even the climax set in a graveyard lends a nice morbid quality to the whole thing .  even if the writing isn't particularly  " logical or credible "  ,  the film has a nice way of intriguing the viewer and just drawing them right in .   cage does a good job in the lead ,  but his co-stars have a grand old time sinking their teeth into their meaty and greed-motivated characters .  hopper ,  boyle ,  and walsh are all fun to watch in these parts .  timothy carhart and dan shor are fine as walshs' deputies  ( in one especially good twist ,  walsh is also the local sheriff )  ,  and there's an entertaining cameo role for country & western star dwight yoakam ,  who also graces the film with an enjoyable end credits tune .   it's quite a good little film worth checking out .  it moves forward at an impressive pace ,  and if nothing else is certainly never boring .   8/10
0	good performances can't save this terrible script ,  larded with every cliche in the chick-flick book .  both main characters are deeply unsympathetic ,  and the scene where laura linney's character reminisces about sex with her dead husband in front of her teenage son -- which i think is supposed to be poignant -- is just horrifying . 
1	an unassuming ,  subtle and lean film ,   " the man in the white suit "  is yet another breath of fresh air in filmic format from ealing studios .  while i suspect some modern viewers may initially find it obscure ,  i doubt many would fail to be charmed by the expert way the plot ,  the themes and characters are languidly relayed during the film's course .   the genuinely great alec guinness gives another fine characterization in a film perhaps not as obviously virtuoso as ealing's inspired  " kind hearts and coronets "  from 1949 .  this time ,  he merely plays one character rather than eight ,  but as the unworldly inventor and scientist sidney stratton ,  he always finds the correct tone and expression .  along with guinness' subtle ,  expressive performance ,  the rest of the cast are effective .  of the main players ,  cecil parker and ernest thesiger do stand out .  thesiger is compellingly absurd as the crippled but influential business grandee ,  while parker is dependable as the ineffectual yet pivotal mill owner and father .  father ,  that is ,  of joan greenwood ,  the deftly delectable comic actress ,  who is at her insurmountable peak in this film .  resplendent and seductive of aspect and diction ,  she is quite sublime in this film ,  a fine contrast with the similarly unusual ,  but more maladroit guinness .  the scene where she seemingly tries to tempt him is played so adeptly by the pair that it is both deeply poignant and amusing .  .  .   the themes are handled very effectively ,  with no easy morals drawn .  the complexities of the relationships between science ,  business and the workforce are insightfully and enjoyably examined .  expertly helmed by alexander mackendrick ,  this film is technically adept in all areas ;  evocative photography ,  fitting sound effects and music and a wistful script ,  all quietly impress .  a thoroughly satisfying film ,  with guinness and greenwood magnificent .   rating : - **** 1/2/*****
0	this movie will promote the improvement of the mind .  read a book !  it's incredible anyone would think this movie deserved the time and investment to make .  i've seen  " b "  movies before but the  " c "  movie has just been invented .  i didn't think i would ever enjoy power rangers since my kids stopped watching but i found myself looking for the videos fifteen minutes into  " knights .  "  high school productions are better than this and the actors involved should erase this from their resume .  embarrassment is one of many descriptions that come to mind .  my roommate ,  who loves these types of movies even turned it off .  now that has to really tell you something .  if you watch this movie ,  and like it ,  i will pray for you . 
0	i cannot believe that they managed to spend us$17million on this film .  spectacularly bad acting ,  egregious scripting and effects that you could do on your average pc ,  unbelievable plot contrivances .  .  . a reporter who can get an inexperienced stewardess a major job at the un ?  what ?  not only that ,  but the message of this film is so unsubtle that you come out feeling as if they've tried to batter you over the head with a full size crucifix .  all this movie will do will preach to the choir and make everyone else laugh at such a ridiculous waste of money .  if the makers of this film really wanted to sway people to christianity and show what it means to truly believe ,  they would have used the money to help people truly in need .  now ,  /that/ might have swayed some people into actually listening to them . 
1	a great film this ,  and a shame that it will receive little attention outside of arthouse circles and students who stay up until two in the morning to watch it on channel four .   the plot is a simple one but works very effectively ,  the blurring between child-like fantasy and hard-hitting nightmare is very well blurred .  the budget looks pretty low ,  but to the credit of those involved it doesn't show too often .  it also hasn't dated that much either .   i was lucky enough to tape this off the telly when it was on a few years ago ,  and it has withstood half-a-dozen viewings .  it's one of those films that won't appeal to all ;  though as usual ,  those with a more thoughtful approach to cinema would get a lot out of this .   charlotte buerke puts in a good performance as anna ,  the spoilt brat and it is a shame she seems to have gone from the acting scene .  cross is also very good ,  carrying the stature of his character very well within the context of the picture .   there are some genuinely  ( and i don't say that lightly )  disturbing moments in this film ,  both half-second shockers and more drawn-out tensions .  watch it with the lights out !   highly recommended .   9/10  
0	don't get me wrong  ,  i want to see marijuana legalized as much as the next guy .  i shall digress now .  the writing ,  though ,  was unrealistic .  a pta mom dealing drugs but adamant about her drugs getting into the hands of an underage person .  give me a break .  the smugness of very pretty mary louise parkers character was an insult to my intelligence .  the characters were not at all likable .  basically ,  the plot lines went nowhere .  i understand its only tv land  .  the hypocrisy was blatant .  mary louise parker is supposed to be a great mom and i am supposed to believe this .  .  .  .  why  ?  ?  ?  ?  i just got the feeling i was being preached by a show reeking of seediness .  its like saying its ok to cheat on your wife  ,  but with someone of legal age status .  ok not exactly the same thing  ,  but i think you people get my point .  that save the children stuff is wonderful for campaign trails  ,  i guess ,  but it does not hold water in a cable sitcom about a suburbanite mom  ,  as the local pot dealer . 
0	over several years of looking for half-decent films to rent for my kids ,  i've developed a sixth-sense for spotting the really cheesy ,  direct-to-video efforts that are really painful to sit through  ( for anyone over the age of eight )  .  i dropped the ball on this one and the kids spent half the movie asking me  " what did she say that for ?  "  and  " why did he do that ?  "  and my eyes got sore from rolling them every minute or so as characters did a really bad job of introducing seemingly random plot changes .  and the next time someone decides that having absolutely no skill with a sword is simply  " bringing realism "  to a film ,  please run them through with a dull butter knife .   " prehysteria !  "  was head and shoulders above this .  arrgh . 
1	this is my favorite classic .  it was filmed a little west of philadelphia ,  pa when i was 13 ,  in 1957 ,  and released the next year .  then in 1970 ,  i found myself working the very same county as a rookie pa state trooper .  i have always enjoyed checking out the different places where scenes were filmed .  i knew the owner of the downingtown diner well ,  and he had a road sign out front which told all passing motorists that this was the  " home of the blob "  .  the theater scene was in phoenixville ,  near valley forge park and it is still showing films today ! 
0	i went to see this with my wife and 3 yr old son .  he seemed to like it a lot more than my wife and i did .  the writing is surprisingly poor for a pixar / disney excursion .  in fact ,  i had a very hard time paying attention at all .  the movie does look amazing but the story just becomes so weird and long winded that i was hoping my son would fall asleep so i could pick him up and walk out .   not to say that the film isn't an interesting concept ,  it's just told so oddly ,   ( bad screenplay ?  )  especially when we  " meet the family "  for the first time .  i know we're supposed to get the impression that the family is wacky but good lord ,  they could've shortened that sequence by a good 15 minutes  ( seemingly ,  i didn't actually time it )  .  by that point i was scratching my head looking for an exit . 
0	although a film with bruce willis is always worth watching ,  you better skip this one .  i watched this one on television ,  so i didn't have to plunk down cash for it .  lucky me .   the plot develops slowly ,  very slowly .  although the first 30 minutes or so are quite believable ,  it gets more and more unbelievable towards the end .  it is highly questionable ,  if a seasoned soldier like lt .  waters would disobey direct orders .  and even if he would ,  if the rest of his platoon would .  they know he puts them in direct danger ,  and they know they will certainly die if they follow him ,  but what the heck ,  he is our lt .  so let's do what he says  ( despite the direct orders ,  remember )  .   still ,  there are some nice scenes in this movie .  they somewhat save a village ,  where the total population is being massacred by the rebels .  well ,  they save a dozen villagers or so ,  the rest was already killed .  the strange part of it ,  that they did take the trucks which the rebels left behind .  they rather go on foot .  maybe because the roads are unsafe ,  but there was no explanation for it .  anyway .  i think this was what earned the movie the one point i gave it .   what made this movie an insult to the brain and hence completely unbelievable is that a group of 7 soldiers can kill of so many rebels without being hurt or killed themselves .  only near the end they loose a few comrades .  and that is only because they have to fight of an army of nearly 500 or more .  can you believe that ?   they fight of an army of so many ,  kill hundreds of them ,  and only loose a few of themselves .  and they have rounds and round of ammo .  never run out of it .  grenades and claymore mines ,  an m60 machine gun and even an rpg .  where do they get this stuff .  carrying it around or what ?  they even got a laptop which shows them the activity of enemy rebels .  and this laptop has a battery which goes on for days .  really ?  who think up this crap .   i guess if you turn off your brain completely and accept that the rebels are a bunch of idiots ,  you give this movie a high rating .  if not ,  skip this one .  it saves you time . 
0	maddy  ( debbie rochon )  is a mentally unstable young woman with a troubled past who gets more than she bargained for when she goes to a pool party with a handsome coworker .  when her date and his friends jokingly say they belong to a `murder club , ' maddy takes it seriously and moves straight up to `level 3' by bashing in the brains of a woman in a parking garage  ( for denting her car !  )  .  but is maddy also the one donning a plastic mask and killing off other members of the group or has someone else lost it ?   the plot of this film  ( originally titled make 'em bleed )  is very poorly conceived ,  full of holes and spirals completely out of control before a ludicrous ,  out-of-left-field twist ending .  some of the dialogue is downright laughable .  i didn't have a problem with rochon's performance ,  but the supporting cast was atrocious .  however ,  i managed to sit through this full moon release thoroughly entertained .  there's plenty of skin and blood and it's the perfect type of flick to sit around with a group of your buddies and pick apart .  horror fans may also enjoy the cameos from brinke stevens and lloyd kaufman  ( as debbie's parents )  and julie strain  ( an early victim )  .   score :  4 out of 10
0	this show had pretty good stories ,  but bad dialog .  the main character was especially annoying .  it's quite obvious why this show was canceled ,  although ,  like most upn shows ,  i never knew it even existed until it was in syndicated re-runs .   most of it's plots seemed to be copied from other shows and movies ,  leading me to think the producers didn't have an original idea in their heads .    i haven't commented enough .  you've got to have at least ten lines of text .  the special effect were not bad for a 2001 show .   the gnome was a nice character . 
0	i don't even know where to begin on this one .   " it's all about the family .  "  that has to be the worst line of dialogue ever heard in a  " horror "  movie ,  although this couldn't be a horror movie even if it tried !  !  !  ugh !  !  !  and i know that owen wilson is a better actor .  he needs to stop playing the token guy who dies in every action movie  ( anaconda ,  armageddon )  .  after all ,  the man did co-write  " bottle rocket "  and  " rushmore .  "  he does have some talent .  also ,  lily taylor should stick to indie films .  she has no place here .  finally ,  catherine zeta-jones should become a porn star .  there's no room in legitimate acting for her .  i'm serious .  one of the worst movies i've ever seen ,  ever . 
1	this movie contains personalities that so deliciously are playing their parts ,  i love the final ,  when nobody knows what are they gonna do about their life ,  but it's completely great when you see and realize that the priest is right ,  is jut for two ,  so what are the other persons doing there ?  the movie embrace you to a new life ,  to experiences ,  to be able of dream with the other person and reach those dreams .  also shows you the life itself ,  hard like it is .  but gives you the option to choose what you want and what you really need .  hope this comment works for you .  the movie it did worked well for me .  i bought the movie by the way  ;  )  take care . 
0	i tried twice to get through this film ,  succeeding the first time - and it was like pulling teeth - and failing the second time despite a great dvd transfer .  the problem ?  it's simply too boring .   if you can get to the dramatic courtroom scene ,  which takes up most of the second half of the film ,  you have it made ,  but it's tough getting to that point .  there are some interesting talks by  " abraham lincoln "   ( henry fonda )  during the trial .  the ending is touching as lincoln walks off and they superimpose his memoral statue over the screen .   it's a nice story ,  well-acted and such .  .  .  . but it lacks spark in the first half and discourages the viewer from hanging in there .  i suspect the real abe lincoln was a lot more interesting than this film . 
1	the fourth in the  " dirty harry "  series ,  this film features one of the most despicable ,  ugliest ,  unlikable ,  profane ,  disgusting females i have ever seen on film :   " ray perkins ,  "  played by audrie neenan .  she is the modern nasty low-life version of the 1945  " detour "  character ,   " ann savage .  "   her foul mouth and gutter attitude turned me off so much i never watched this film again until i acquired a profanity filter which shut her up .  .  .  . and least some of her !  then i could enjoy the rest of the movie .   everywhere  " harry callahan "   ( clint eastwood )  goes ,  violence immediately follows .  .  .  .  . within minutes !  it happens so often it's almost laughable but it makes for a fast-moving ,  entertaining film with a satisfying ending as all the scumbag villains are eliminated one-by-one .   this is a very sophomoric film that appeals to our base instincts .  .  .  .  . and connects ,  sad to say .  most of us like to see these dirtballs get it in the end ,  and who does it better than dirty harry ? 
1	anyone who doesn't think bill and ted's bogus journey is one of the greatest movies of all time needs their head checked .  it somehow manages to be both completely inane and no-brainer ,  but also terrifying knowing and clever at the same time .  one of those rare films that actually improves upon it predecessor ,  bogus journey can be enjoyed again and again .  notable highlights include the duel with death and the ending ,  which is highly  " emotional "  .  keanu wants to forget all that matrix rubbish and get down to doing what he does best ,  ted theodore logan in bill and ted :  the return . 
0	put the blame on executive producer wes craven and financiers the weinsteins for this big-budget debacle :  a thrash-metal updating of  " dracula "  ,  with a condescending verbal jab at bram stoker  ( who probably wouldn't want his name on this thing anyway )  and nothing much for the rest of us except slasher-styled jolts and gore .  christopher plummer looks winded as van helsing in the modern-day--not just a descendant of van helsing but the real thing ;  he keeps himself going with leeches obtained from count dracula's corpse ,  which is exhumed from its coffin after being stolen from van helsing's vault and flown to new orleans .  this is just what new orleans needs in the 21st century !  the film ,  well-produced but without a single original idea  ( except for multi-racial victims )  ,  is both repulsive and lazy ,  and after about an hour starts repeating itself .  * from ****
0	yes ,  mtv there really is a way to market daria .  what started as a clever teenage angst- " comment on everything that sucks and make the viewer feel better about their sucky teenage life "  sitcom now mutated into a  " how you should deal with your problems " -charade .  i used to watch daria all the time and loved it .  now ,  sitting here after watching the so called  " movie "  i can only wonder what the point of this all was .  daria tells us how to lead out life in college ?  excuse me ?  didn't the point daria made every episode that what you like to do is ok ,  as long as it is ok with yourself no matter what the rest of the sick sad world thinks of it ?  this entire thing reminded me of the scene in  " reality bites "  the movie channel shows the documentry for the first time . 
0	usually i'm a bit of a fan of the bad eighties & early nineties film featuring now has beens .  .  . but this film is so incredibly terrible that it was a real endurance test to sit through .  guys dressing up as girls has been done to death - but never so pathetically .  corey haim's performance was abysmal as usual ,  nicole eggert was not much better .  this has no redeeming qualities ,  even if you are a number #1 fan of an actor/actress in this piece of trash - stay away ! 
0	waiting to go inside the theathre with tickets in my hand ,  i expected an interesting sci-fi fantasy movie which could finally feed my appetite of movies regarding robot-technology ,  instead i went disappointed by each aspect of it ,  once more proving that stunning special effects can't help a boring plot ,  which by my opinion was the worse in this year .  acting in this movie also dissatisfied me ,  will smith didn't show anything new in this movie ,  yet i never saw his acting to change since  " men in black "  which was his only success by my opinion .  he had to retire since than ,  not spoiling his name with titles like  " i , robot "  and  " men in black 2 "  .  4/10
0	john rivers' life as an architect and family man has taken a turn for the worst when his wife has disappeared and has been concluded dead after a freakish accident that involved changing a tyre on her car .  during the days she has been missing ,  he confronts a man that's been following and he tells him that his been in contact with his dead wife from the other-side through e . v . p - electronic voice phenomenon .  naturally he doesn't believe it but then hear gets weird phone calls from her phone and so he contacts the man to find out more about e . v . p .  soon enough john is hooked onto it ,  but something supernatural doesn't like him interfering with the dead ,  as now other then contacting his wife ,  the white noise is foretelling events before they happen .   since this dvd has been sitting on my shelf for a while now ,  i thought i better get around to watching it since it wasn't my copy .  but then again i don't think the owners were in a hurry to get it back ,  as they haven't question me about it .  oh well .  so i decided to give it a play ,  as i was in an undemanding mood .  after hearing and reading all the bad press on it ,  i wasn't expecting anything remotely good ,  but i was kept entertained for 90 minutes .  well ,  more so the 60 minutes ,  as the last half-an-hour was pretty much a blur of confusion .  the film is nowhere as good as it could have been ,  but the time breezed by quick enough even though it's a rather tepid supernatural thriller .  i thought it wasn't all a waste .  the first hour i found some effective sequences rather interesting and there's a spooky awe generated with a slow progression of subtle stillness and tragedy that haunts you ,  but sadly that comes to a crashing halt later on in the film .  that's when the predictably forced jump scares come into their own and somehow it just doesn't fit in with the context .  it becomes rather hectic ,  loud and very muddled with its mtv style editing and kinetic camera-work that gets to close into the action .  i couldn't understand what was going on within choppy and abrupt climax .  the whole explanation how everything fits into the bigger picture is pure hokey .  it's a very unsatisfying conclusion because it goes for something big ,  but hits rock bottom .  i thought they did fine job up until that point with the lighting and showy camera-work .  other then the distinctively stark lighting ,  the score kept this flick atmospherically gloomy .  all of it is very slickly done with its glossed up and fancy hardware ,  which makes it come across as very sterile and empty .   you can easily see that the film's heart is in the technical components and not in expanding the characters and story .  there's just no connection and lasting sentiment within this flimsy material .  after a while ,  it just tries too hard to convince you that it falls into manipulative thrills and popping in many blood-curdling stuff from beyond the grave .  it just got rather repetitious watching someone watch a fuzzy tv screen after while .  the e . v . p machine was the star on the show .  well ,  it did have more impact than the limp performances .  michael keaton is more than capable actor ,  but lately his disappeared off the map and here he provides a modest performance as the dangerously obsessed john rivers .  he really deserves much better ,  though .  everyone else is pretty brittle and forgettable .  not because of the performances ,  but of the lack of depth in their characters .  this clunker wasn't bad to begin with ,  but it does go pear shape by falling away drastically .   i wouldn't care to see it again and i wouldn't recommend to anyone ,  unless you got a interest for the subject matter and enjoy the recent crop of hollywood produced horror/thrillers .  it's just a damn shame that this over-produced flick couldn't put it together successfully ,  as it had promise in its idea and a more than decent cast on hand .  i didn't hate it ,  but what a disappointment . 
0	this movie is similar to darkness falls , and the boogeyman ( 2005 ) but it's also much more graphic than both , and not as good as either . it's also slow and fairly predictable . it's also got shades of deliverance and the amityville horror . plus , we get some new age flavour thrown in the mix and some of those scenes come off as a motivational/inspirational sermon . really , this movie is a hodgepodge of almost everything . even though it is gory , the makeup effects are not very realistic looking . in fact they look kinda cheap . aside from all that , there is some really awful clichéd dialogue . and i won't say when , but there is a point where a couple of the character's actions were not authentic or believable , given the circumstances . nobody in their right mind what would have acted this way . once you watch the movie , you'll know what i mean . there's also some gratuitous nudity for nudity's sake . it just wasn't necessary at all . the good news is that the acting was actually pretty good . better than this movie deserves . so , after carefully weighing the evidence , id say this movie was passable , but not good . my verdict for the tooth fairy : 4/10
0	this movie is a horrible distortion of lies and exaggerations that were put together by the most shameless lunatics to ever work on a tv movie .  the story is wrong and a complete lie .  there is nothing in this movie that accurately portrays senator mccarthy .  it's just a horrible scam and it amazes me that anyone associated with this production ever got another job in the industry .  the marxist-leninists who wrote this trash did so in order to attack a man who has been vindicated by history and their fear that anyone would dare to destroy communism .  unfortunately for these communist nut jobs ,  ronald reagan took over where mccarthy left off and they couldn't stop him ,  thus the end of the soviet union and its' cohorts .   never ,  ever watch this film if you're looking for truth regarding sen .  mccarthy .  read ann coulter's book ,   " treason "  for a better look at the truth about sen .  mccarthy .   it will also help if you read about what really happened to senator mccarthy by reading http : //www . thenewamerican . com/tna/1996/vo12no18/vo12no18_mccarthy . htm
0	bela lugosi plays a doctor who will do anything to keep his wife looking young and beautiful .  to this end ,  he drugs brides during their wedding ceremonies to make it look as if they are dead so he can steal their bodies .  i'm not exactly sure what he does with the bodies .  i don't remember it ever being fully explained .  all i know is that he extracts something from them and injects it in his wife .   ( i'll just guess that it's spinal fluid .  spinal fluid was all the rage of mad scientists in the 40s .  )  you can pretty much guess the rest from here .   there are a couple  ( well ,  really more than a couple ,  but i'll only write about two )  of problems that i have with this movie .  one is the way bela is used .  sure ,  he does a decent enough job in his own overacting sort of way  ( btw ,  the rest of the cast is simply abysmal )  .  but ,  to have him hiding in the back of a hearse or having him creep into the female reporter's bedroom to do nothing is just silly .  also ,  why have him beat and/or kill every henchman he has ?  is it to make him look evil ?  well ,  someone who is kidnapping comatose brides doesn't really need to be made to look more evil .   the second problem i have is the idea of drugging brides .  why brides ?  wouldn't any female under the age of 20 do ?  watching bela go through these gyrations to get his victims ,  i was reminded of the idiotic fisherman in i still know what you did last summer .  in each case ,  there would appear to be an easier way of reaching your objective than employing a seemingly impossible plan that depends way to much on circumstances out of your control .   ( btw ,  an alternate title for this movie is the case of the missing brides .  i guess that partially explains the need for 'brides' .  ) 
1	i am currently on vacation in israel for summer ,  and so was able to see this incredible film .  a bit of a warning before i begin writing :  i speak fluent hebrew ,  and so the hebrew parts were no problem ;  however ,  about a quarter  ( a bit less )  of the film is in arabic ,  and i was unable to understand a bit of this subtitled bit .  this did not detract from my understanding of the film ,  but did cause me to miss a few jokes which evoked some strong laughs in the theater .   after a year of american cinema which many hailed as one of the greatest years for homosexual cinema and relationships ,  it takes something truly special to stand head and shoulders above the rest ;  yet ,   " the bubble "  surpasses all others with its blend of excellent acting ,  witty dialogue ,  and relevant political climate .   the film opens on a checkpoint on the israeli-palestinian border ;  for the first few moments ,  we are unsure about the type of movie we have walked in on .  yet ,  this is an important element of this film's strength .  the political situation ,  and the extreme tension in the air is constantly in the background .  most importantly ,  tel aviv serves as a character of its own in this film .  it is constantly referenced .  street names and restaurant names are constantly exchanged .  the skyline and city development is critiqued quite harshly ,  and ultimately the city evolves along with the film the film focuses on the love between noam  ( ohad knoller )  and a palestinian immigrant ,  ashraf ( yousef 'joe' sweid )  ,  with the societies of tel aviv and palestine serving as a constant foil .  we always know that their relationship is forbidden ,  and this creates a sense of urgency rarely present in cinema .  the love is incredibly strong ,  and stands as the centerpiece of the film .  the secondary relationships and friendships are equally strong :  flamboyant restaurant owner yelli's  (  yousef 'joe' sweid )  relationship with the ultra-butch and grating golani solider ,  golan  ( zohar liba )  ,  is particularly a source of amusement .  the love scenes which abound in this film are all exquisite ,  fine crafted works of art ,  and the cinematography is astounding :  in the first love scene of the film ,  the camera pans down as a male character gives oral sex to lulu  ( daniela virtzer )  ,  and dissolves into a shot of noam and ashraf .  this shot any many others lead the viewer to realize that all of these relationships are expressions of the very same form of love .   to give away more of the storyline would be a tragedy ,  but know that there is a lot of political tension and tragedy which touches onto the current world political climate ,  so i will instead focus on the witty dialogue .  even when watching this movie in my second language ,  i could not stop laughing throughout .  lines of particular amusement include the question of whether gay suicide bombers receive virgin women or men in heaven ,  and an analogy of sampson from the bible as the worlds first suicide bomber .  this dialogue shows a particular sense of purity and reality which is rarely seen in cinema .  the music used in the film is also particularly powerful .  music is only used in times when characters legitimately could or should be listening to it ,  and in one scene the music weakens when a character removes one earphone and stops when he removes the other .  little elements like this truly elevate the film .   i could not give greater recommendation to a film ;  this is a superb work of cinema which is catharthic as well as extremely well crafted . 
1	i love playing football and i thought this movie was great because it contained a lot of football in it .  this was a good hollywood/bollywood film and i am glad it won 17 awards .  parminder nagra and kiera knightley were good and so was archie punjabi .  jonathon rheyes meyers was great at playing the coach .  jazz  ( parminder nagra )  loves playing football but her parents want her to learn how to cook an want her to get married .  when jazz starts playing for a football team secretly she meets juliet  ( kiera knightlety )  and joe  ( jonathon rhyes meyers )  who is her coach .  when her parents find out trouble strikes but her dad lets her play the big match on her sisters pinky  ( archie punjabi's )  wedding .  at the end her parents realise how much she loves football and let her go abroad to play . 
0	this film is the worst excuse for a motion picture i have ever seen .  to begin ,  i'd like to say the the front cover of this film is by all means misleading ,  if you think you are about to see a truly scary horror film with a monster clown ,  you are soooo wrong .  in fact the killers face doesn't even slightly resemble the front cover ,  it's just an image they must have found on google and thought it looked cool .  speaking of things they found and thought it looked cool ,  there is a scene in this film where some of the gang are searching for the friend in the old woods ,  then suddenly the screen chops to a scene where there is a mother deer nurturing it's young in a glisten of sunlight .  .  .  i mean seriously wtf ?  ?  ?  how is this relevant to the dark woods they are wandering through ?  i bought this film from a man at a market hoping it would be entertaining ,  if it wasn't horror then at least it would be funny right ?  wrong !  the next day i gave it to my work colleague ridding myself from the plague named s . i . c . k  bottom line is :  don't see this film !  !  ! 
1	i thought it was an original story ,  very nicely told .  i think all you people are expecting too much .  i mean .  .  . it's just a made for television movie !  what are you expecting ?  some great wonderful dramtic piece ?  i thought it was a really great story for a made for television movie .  .  .  . and that's my opinion . 
1	sunday july 16 ,  8 : 00pm the castro ,  san francisco   " as a southern colonel your make-up is very indiana "   the yammering gossips of hollywood have managed to sling more than a little mud in marion davies direction over the years .  that she had fame handed to her and was undeserving ,  is often speculated .  considering the mawkish dramas she was so often pushed into ,  this criticism would seem to have some validity .  as a comedienne however ,  her star shone very brightly .  left to pursue a career in light comedy and slapstick she might have rivaled mabel normand .  one of her better outings was king vidor's show people  ( 1928 )  ,  which survives and is so well known largely because mgm filled it with star cameos .  this happy coincidence inadvertently saved what is surely among the best work of its two stars ,  davies and that notorious joe college wise-cracker ,  william haines .  rumor has it show people was loosely based on the life of gloria swanson ,  who began in sennett comedies and rose to grand drama  ( and don't think she didn't spend the rest of her life reminding everyone !  )  with von stroheim ,  walsh and demille .  coincidentally ,  the comedy studios used in this film are the original digs keystone had abandoned the year before  ( think of who worked there !  )  .   colonel marmaduke oldfish pepper  ( dell henderson )  drives his daughter peggy  ( davies )  from georgia to hollywood to star in the movies .  these two country hicks are unsuspecting fodder for incorrigible billy boone  ( haines )  ,   "   a custard pie artist "  who descends on their cafeteria table in an outrageously funny entrance  ( watch for the bit with the noodle )  ,  and then helps peggy land a part in his next picture .  what she thinks is high drama turns out to be screwball ,  but a job is a job and billy convinces her  "   .   .  all the stars have to take it on the chin   "  .  at the preview ,  billy and peggy bump into .  .  charlie chaplin ,  who asks for her autograph !  she pushes the little fellow aside and a horrified billy grabs the book and makes her sign .  chaplin climbs in his car and billy tells peggy who shes just snubbed ,  so naturally ,  she faints .  it's so very funny ,  considering davies character isn't supposed to recognize this guy !  peggy soon moves on to work at the high art studios ,  changes her name to 'patricia pepoire' and leaves poor billy behind .  davies does a wonderful send-up of a serious actress ,  with all the prerequisite fluttering eyelashes and quivering lips .  vidor throws in a parade of stars eating lunch in a long tracking shot  ( and they're all sitting shoulder to shoulder ,  facing the camera !  )  that includes polly moran  ( who's also sensationally funny playing davies' maid )  ,  louella parsons  ( one of the friendly vampires )  ,  estelle taylor ,  claire windsor aileen pringle ,  the comedy duo of karl dane  ( with his arm in a sling )  and george k .  arthur  ( pretending he's stealing the silverware )  ,  leatrice joy  ( amused by arthur's antics )  ,  renee adoree ,  rod  ( eating and smoking )  la rocque ,  mae murray ,  john  ( in a robe )  gilbert  ( who also appears driving through the mgm gates early in the picture )  ,  norma  ( eeeww !  )  talmadge  ( looking bitchy and aloof as usual )  and patricia dressed like marie antoinette ,  sandwiched between douglas fairbanks  ( as he does an amusing trick )  and william s .  hart  ( protecting her from doug )  .  billy runs into the high art crew on location when the comedy troupe disrupts their filming ,  with predictably nutty results .  vidor even works himself into the final scene as the director of peggy's current production .  also worth noting are harry gribbon as the comedy director doing a great caricature of eddie sedgwick ,  sidney bracy as the dramatic director who can't get peggy to cry for her screen test and then can't stop her once she does ,  and paul ralli as andre ,  her dramatic love interest and a hilarious phony .  when her character tries to 'act' its as though davies is poking fun at all the awful dramas she'd been forced into and she's brilliant doing it .   while it's true show people is a hokey satire of the 'good ole days' ten years hence ,  it remains a highly entertaining example of quality work from mgm ,  irving thalberg ,  and their tremendous wealth of assembled talent .  what a shame so much has been lost .  there are also far too many examples of great films like the patsy  ( 1928 )  ,  vidor and davies' hugely successful comedy from earlier that same year ,  languishing in vaults when they could be seen and enjoyed .

0	poor performances by sinatra ,  martin and hyer .  grossly underdeveloped supporting characters .  annoying talky with no real plot .  ending leaves you flatter than a pancake ,  with more loose ends than you could tie up in four sequels  ( that is ,  if you even cared about these wooden characters )  .  maclaine is the only real asset .  that penultimate sequence in which the  " chicago hood "  searches for the sinatra character is laughable .  the music in that sequence also is poor .  and in the final scene when martin's character removes his hat for the woman he called a  " pig ,  "  almost made me go outside and find a stone to throw through my television screen . 
0	it's interesting that all who  ( so far )  seemed to like this film had no expectations--i guess that's the trick .  in contrast with them ,  i had optimistic expectations ,  and that was a mistake .  as soon as i saw how close to the faces the camera always was ,  i knew we were in the hands of an extremely amateur director--that's always a clear sign of them ,  they think it is arty or effective or intense to hold the camera about two inches away from the actors .  the actors in this film ,  though ,  had only one facial expression each .    if the close camera wasn't enough ,  the lack of light in the film killed it .  the film seemed to be entirely filmed in the dark .  so now we know that the cinematographer was a rank amateur ,  as well .   " ooh ooh ,  we're going to light the set with a flashlight !  that will make it all seem intimate !  "  no ,  that made it all seem invisible .   on top of the serious technical flaws ,  there was absolutely no story beyond the barest hint of an idea that was never developed ,  and nothing new about this kind of relationship was illuminated .   ( perhaps this is a new kind of film for germany ,  but in los angeles ,  forget about it .  )   the fact that this film won a couple of film festival awards doesn't indicate the quality of the film ,  but besmirches the quality of these particular festivals .  i can assure you that this film won't win anything in the festival where i saw it .  in fact ,  two times during the film it seemed that it was finally over and people started to get up to leave  ( this was one of the side effects of the cinematographer's  " total darkness "  technique )  .  but when the film shuddered on ,  instead ,  there were moans coming from the audience .  and once the movie finally did end ,  it was clear that it hadn't mattered if it actually had ended at either of the two earlier points .  an earlier ending would have saved the audience from yet more monotonous scenes of domesticity  ( folding sheets ,  cutting vegetables ,  spreading honey on bread )  .  yeah ,  we get it ,  the life of the lonely old man was boring-- but we figured that one out at the very beginning .   i recommend that audiences miss this one ,  it has absolutely nothing to offer sophisticated movie-goers . 
0	if this movie were more about piper perabo's character and less about the bar ,  this might have been halfway decent .  piper's violet stanford and karen friendly  ( adventures of rocky and bullwinkle )  both have a virgin kindegarden teacher quality to them that's endearing .  here's hoping she'll find a better movie to be in . 
0	pathetic attempt to use science to justify new age religion/philosophy .  the two have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said about quantum physics in this mess is just plain wrong .   examples ?  quantum theory supports the ideas in eastern religions that reality is an illusion .  how ?  well ,  in the world of the subatomic ,  you can never definitely predict a particles location at a specific time .  you can only give the odds of it being precisely at one spot at one time .  also ,  the act of observation seems to affect the event .  solid particles can pass through barriers .  all of this ,  so far ,  is accurate .  but then they assert that that means that if you believed sincerely enough that you could walk through a wall ,  you could indeed do it .  this is complete poppycock .  instead ,  the theory asserts that at our level ,  it is possible for you to walk through a wall ,  but it is merely by chance and has nothing to do with belief .  also you'd have to keep walking into the wall for eternity to ever have even the remotest chance of passing through the wall ,  the odds are so astronomically against it .   this is but one example of how they misrepresent the science .  but much more annoying is the narrative involving an unhappy photographer ,  played by marlee maitlan .  about halfway through the picture it becomes so confused as to be incomprehensible .  something to do with negative thoughts leading to addiction and self-hate .  there may be some truth to that ,  but quantum physics has nothing to do with it .   plus ,  string theory is the hot new thing in physics nowadays .  instead of wasting your time with this dreck ,  i suggest you rent the elegant universe ,  an amazing series done for nova on pbs that gives you a history of physics from newton and gravity to ed witten and m theory in only 3 hour-long episodes .  quantum mechanics is explained there quite well if you want to know it without the fog of metaphysical appropriation . 
1	the bible teaches us that the love of money is the root of all evil .  the love of money leads to greed which can lead to pride and eventually to destruction .  two brothers ,  andy and hank ,  will discover how far the love of money will cost them and those they love the most .   andy hanson  ( philip seymour hoffman )  and his younger brother hank  ( ethan hawke )  couldn't be more different .  andy is seemingly enjoying the success of working in new york's real estate market and is married to his beautiful wife gina  ( marisa tomei )  who is the idea of a trophy wife if one ever existed .  hank ,  however ,  is divorcée who finds himself at the mercy of his ex-wife ,  his daughter's expensive school bills ,  and endless amount of child support payments .  a man who means well and has good intentions ,  hank none the less cannot escape the water that his slowly raising above his head no matter how hard he swims to stay above it .   however ,  andy has his own problems with the only difference between him and his brother being that he hides them better .  he has committed fraud against his company and is heavily involved in drug use in order to escape his fears .  the pressure of his life ,  and the lies he needs to keep his appearances up ,  have now caused him to think about fleeing the country with gina in order to start over again .  of course ,  like hank ,  he needs money to do this and believes he knows how to get it .  how ?  by robbing the jewelery store that their parents own and run .  this act of betrayal is where the hanson brothers ,  their families ,  and several other lives ,  will be destroyed because of greed ,  pride ,  and fear .    the uniqueness of before the devil knows you're dead is the manner in which the story is told .  after the robbery goes wrong ,  and nanette hanson  ( rosemary harris )  who is the mother of both andy and hank is killed ,  the story is told from a variety of different points of view from various days before and after the robbery attempt .  we learn more about the motivations of not only andy and hank but also the reaction to their father charles  ( albert finney )  to the death of his wife .  the relationship between charles and his two sons ,  especially to andy ,  is also explored and another possible motivation of sorts is discovered after it is revealed that there is little love between the two men .  nanette may have been dearly loved by her sons but their father is a different story .   philip seymour hoffman proves once more why he is one of the most impressive actors in hollywood today by portraying andy as not only a greedy criminal with lack of morality but also ,  in contradictory way ,  as a man we can sympathize with .  ethan hawke also brings hank alive not just as a loser but really as a man just desperate to hang on to what little he has left .  andy and hank are thus brought to life in such a realistic way that it is easy to think of them as not just characters but the very real images of lost and confused men who now find themselves facing the consequence of their actions .   before the devil knows you're dead is a moral tale about how our actions lead to consequences that we otherwise might not expect to face .  more than that ,  our choices also can affect those around us in ways we never expected .  in what should have been best picture of the year ,  we see how lives are easily broken when the love of money becomes the ultimate pursuit in order to ease our troubled lives .  in other words ,  there are no easy fixes or answers to our problems and trying to find them can only make things worse .   10/10
0	my 10-year-old daughter ,  alexandra ,  writes :   i thought it was very boring ,  and i thought it was just a repeat of stuff from  " 101 dalmatians .

0	i'm so confused .  i've been a huge seagal fan for 25 years .  i've seen all of his films ,  and many of those dozens of times .  i can only describe this film as  " bizarre .  "  steven seagal shares screenplay writing and producing credits on this film ,  but i have a really tough time believing he would choose to dub over his own voice for so many of his lines ,  with a thin ,  whiny imposter's voice no less .  what i also don't get is ,  if they had to dub some of his lines ,  why does his own voice appear on the rest of them ?  i expect seagal to age like the rest of us .  but the seagal in this movie barely exudes a fraction of the same swagger ,  confidence ,  bravado ,  charm ,  and sex-appeal he so easily showed us in all of his previous movies .  what i found myself missing most of all was his cocky ,  self-assured attitude and his bad-ass sneer that so easily shifts into that adorable grin .  where is that in-your-face attitude and charm that made him such a huge star ?  ?  ?  i hope that this film is not an indication of what seagal has left to offer us - if so ,  his lifelong fans will have to concede that the seagal we all knew and loved is gone . 
0	five years after the original creepshow ,  another inferior horror sequel is penned by george a .  romero and stephen king :  creepshow 2 .  this time there are only three stories instead of five .  none of the three stories is really original or distinguished either .  the first story is a horror staple ,  formulaic story about a wooden indian statue seeking revenge against the killers of its owners .  the effects are really neat in this story ,  but it's just too familiar to be compelling enough .  george kennedy and dorothy lamour play the elderly store owners .  the second story ,   " the raft "  ,  is a stephen king story .  it's about four teenagers that unwittingly spend the day on a wooden pallet in the middle of an isolated lake .  soon the kids are screaming for their lives as a watery blob does each of them in for no apparent reason .  however ,  instead of being suspenseful ,  the kids are saddled with bad dialog and dopey-headed behavior ,  preventing us from really caring about what happens next .  there is also some unintentional humor in this segment .  the third and final story is  " the hitch-hiker "  ,  which is actually a retread re-adapted for creepshow 2 .  the original story ,  by lucille fletcher ,  was filmed in 1953 as a film noir suspense film .  then it was adapted for a famous twilight zone episode featuring inger stevens .   " the hitch-hiker "  works the best out of these three offerings ,  but it's not without its problems either .  lois chiles plays a cheating spouse ,  who ends up running over a hitch-hiker ,  or so she thinks .  however ,  we don't know whether to sympathize with her or condemn her .  as in many average stories of this type ,  the characters exist merely to tell the stories with their twists and turns .  the wrap around story with the bullies seems a bit out of place .  tom savini appears as the  " creep "  in this installment .  the good thing is there haven't been any more sequels .  *1/2 of 4 stars . 
0	this sword-&-sorcery story of an appallingly brutal and callous  " hero "  vanquishing an evil king is worthless in almost every detail .  the acting is horrible from the leads to the supporting roles .  the leering ,  gloating glee with which the director shows the hero smearing blood around is absolutely disgusting ;  nor is it redeemed by any justice to his cause ,  since he is as bad as the people he's fighting .  z-movie editing is abundant ,  including a scene where a character  " dies "  from a sword thrust that very obviously missed completely !   the movie is clearly banking on the charms of the female leads ,  barbi benton and lana clarkson ,  who are paraded around mostly naked throughout the movie .  as a 20-something male ,  i will not pretend that female flesh on the screen doesn't attract me .  but the treatment of their characters is so degrading and the sex scenes so casual and joyless ,  that i couldn't enjoy even this aspect of the movie .   most cheesy movies of this era are at least somewhat redeemed by a light-hearted ,  tongue-in-cheek feel  ( the sequel is better in this regard )  ,  but deathstalker seems to take itself completely seriously as heroic fantasy .  no way !  avoid at all costs !   rating :  1/2 out of **** .

1	robert stack never really got over losing a best supporting actor oscar for his role as kyle in  " written on the wind "  to anthony quinn's 12-minute performance in  " lust for life .  "  stack plays the deeply disturbed ,  alcoholic son of an oil tycoon .  he has lived his life in the shadow of the friend with whom he was raised ,  mitch ,  played by rock hudson .  they both love the same woman ,  lucy ,   ( lauren bacall )  ,  who becomes kyle's wife .  kyle's sister ,  marylee  ( dorothy malone )  ,  is a drunken slut who's in love with mitch .  their story plays out in glorious color under the able direction of douglas sirk ,  who really dominated the melodrama field with some incredible films ,  including  " imitation of life ,  "   " all that heaven allows ,  "   " magnificent obsession ,  "  and many others .   make no mistake - this is a potboiler ,  and stack and dorothy malone make the most of their roles ,  malone winning a best supporting actress oscar .  there's one amazing scene ,  mentioned in other comments ,  where she wildly dances to loud music as her father collapses and dies on the staircase .  we're led to believe that marylee sleeps with everyone ,  including the guy that pumps the gas ,  because she's in love with mitch .  mitch wants nothing to do with her .  he's so in love with lucy that ,  out of loyalty to kyle ,  he wants to go to work in iran to avoid temptation .  i doubt he'd be so anxious to get there today no matter how much in love he was .   hudson and bacall have the less exciting roles here - hudson's mitch is the good guy who's been cleaning up kyle's messes for his entire life ,  and bacall is mitch's wife who finds herself in a nightmare when her husband starts drinking again after a year of sobriety .  sirk focuses on the more volatile supporting players .   in sirk's hands ,   " written on the wind "  is an effective film ,  and the big scene toward the end in the mansion is particularly exciting .  the director had a gift for this type of movie ,  and though he had many imitators ,  he never had an equal . 
0	i must say that i am fairly disappointed by this  " horror "  movie .  i did not get scared even once while watching it .  it also is not very suspenseful either .  .  .  .  i was able to guess the ending half way through the movie .  .  .  so .  .  what's left ?    " the ring "  is a trully scary movie .  .  .  i wish other movies would stop copying from it  ( e . g .  the trade-mark :  long hair )  .  please give me some originality .   will not recommend this movie . 
0	summer season is here when the choices in the cinemas are limited to what's the hottest movie of the week ,  given 99 . 9% of the screens dedicated to screening it .  ok ,  so i may exaggerate on the percentage ,  but you get my drift .  besides stuff from hollywood ,  bollywood too have their own share of highly anticipated blockbusters ,  and from some of the trailers shown ,  i'm hyped to watch them too .  tashan was billed as one of the most highly anticipated for 2008 ,  but i was quite surprised at the lower than low turnout at the cinemas .  when i watched jodha akbar ,  it was a full house ,  but it wasn't for tashan .   after watching it ,  i knew why .  it was entertaining ,  but it was fundamentally weak .  just like it's literal english title ,  which means  " style "  ,  tashan is all style ,  but little substance .  not that it doesn't have the usual star power ,  but scenes felt forced ,  and some bordered on a tad ridiculous ,  even for bollywood standards i must say .  which is quite surprising given that tashan is directed and written by vijay krishna acharya ,  who wrote dhoom and dhoom 2 ,  both of which i enjoyed tremendously .    in his rookie directorial outing with tashan ,  while you can't fault his direction ,  you'd probably scratch your head over the plot ,  which was clunky at best .  it tried to force too many things into the story ,  though credit be given where it allowed you some avenue to question character motivation ,  but that came a little too late ,  and only toward the finale ,  which left you guessing for just a moment before it latched into full blown action mimicking many a thai action movie ,  with hong kong's wirework and hollywood's ludicrous firearms and gunplay with zero recoil .  and in a bid to include everything including the kitchen sink ,  you have an assortment of vehicles appearing ,  and the one that took the cake ,  in a dhoom 2 homage ,  was the jetski boat in the middle of nowhere .   at best ,  tashan can be enjoyed as unintentional comedy ,  and this is attributed to how the cast hammed up with their characters .  saif ali khan plays jimmy cliff ,  a call center executive who gives english tuition ,  only as a platform for fishing out new girlfriend material .  his playboy ways gets junked aside when he meets with pooja singh  ( kareena kapoor )  ,  who's not exactly who she seems ,  the meek and sweet natured hottie .  she engages jimmy's services for her boss ,  mobster bhaiyyaji  ( anil kapoor )  ,  who probably gets most of the laughs as he speaks broken english and phrases must like how an ah-beng does it .  and to complete the quartet ,  akshay kumar plays bachchan pandey ,  an illiterate gangster for hire who got engaged by bhaiyyaji to hunt down jimmy and pooja when they escape with money stolen from bahiyyaji's business .   so begins a road trip of sorts ,  with friends who turned enemies ,  and enemies whom you know will become friends as the road trip wears on .  jimmy cliff is probably the most implausible of all ,  because he goes from zero to hero ,  executing moves that would shame rambo ,  in absolutely no time ,  which is quite out of character .  kareena kapoor amps up the sex factor as she uses her charms to guile both men ,  and has plenty of opportunity to do so given the much touted bikini scenes ,  and other costumes that boast of plunging necklines or hemlines way above the knee .  every character has a backstory created ,  and i thought akshay kumar's bachchan pandey was probably the best ,  the most touching and the most fun of the lot ,  even though his character seemed a lot like a non-green incredible hulk with his gravity-defying leaps and power packing punches .  his wounds also heal automatically ,  which impressively puts wolverine to shame .  and the best part is his theme song ,  which is damn alpha-male and played in ra-ra mode each time he takes on adversaries .   but sad to say ,  that's the only tune that is memorable ,  something that cheers  " bachchan- pandey-bachchan-pandey "  .  for most bollywood movies i watch ,  i will usually be able to ,  despite the obvious language gaps ,  emerge from screenings humming a tune or two .  i wasn't able to do that after tashan ,  because the songs unfortunately just weren't catchy at all .  usually the song/dance routine works well into the storyline without any necessity to bring the characters out of the current scene or location .  that i enjoy ,  versus plucking them out and plonking them into extreme settings high atop a mountain ,  or atop jagged rocks on the beach front .   tashan probably didn't take itself too seriously ,  but coming from vijay krishna acharya's story ,  you probably wanted something a little more decent rather than the ridiculous ,  and for continuity to be a little more careful as well .  billed as a blockbuster ,  now i can start to understand why the crowds have already shunned this one .  despite akshay kumr stealing the show ,  tashan could have been better on the whole . 
1	spoilers following :  i picked up the book  " evil angels "  when it first came out knowing nothing of the case .  just to give the press and the austrialian people a break here ,  i was quite far into it before i began to question the chamberlain's guilt .  the author obviously intended the reader to understand why the public jumped to the conclusions they did .  john bryson told the story just as it was presented to the jurors  ( and picked up by the press )  of the arterial spray ,  the actelone  (  ?  ?  )  plates ,  dr .  james cameron's certainty that the collar was cut with scissors ,  that a baby could not be taken whole from her clothes with the buttons still done up ,  bloody hand print ,  etc .  all quite convincingly .  after all ,  these were experts in their fields who were testifying with no apparent reason to lie ,  and the fact that the evidence was completely wrong wasn't apparent to me at all .  it was also highly technical evidence ,  difficult for a layman to understand .  to this point ,  beyond some hearsay testimony in the trials ,  hardly anyone had ever heard of a dingo attacking a human ;  people didn't believe it was possible .  the public was suspicious of the seventh day adventists ,  whose origins made them appear to be a cult ,  and all sorts of wild beliefs about them contributed to the appearance of guilt .  were it not for dedicated ,  selfless lawyers who worked relentlessly to investigate and counter the trial testimony ,  finding azaria's clothes later would not have been enough to get lindy out of jail .  the book shook me for that reason ,  and i've been reluctant to come to a conclusion about anyone's guilt ever since  ( excepting oj of course )  .  i was thrilled that a movie was going to be made about the case and don't think it could have been done better .  i've always liked sam ,  who i could identify with completely ,  and meryl was perfect as always .  beautiful photography ,  haunting music .  i think it's not only a very good ,  but a very important ,  movie .  too bad it didn't receive more publicity at the time it was released . 
0	mean spirited ,  and down right degrading adaptation to the classic children's tale not only lacks the charm of its forefather but lacks any talent what so ever .  mike myers should not only be ashamed of himself for his horrible performance that is a clear rip off of what jim carrey did but he should give up acting all together .  he is so annoying that you would want to beat the crap out of him if you were able to jump right in the film .  the sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor .  i have seen a lot of bad film this year ,  but this not only takes the cake but it is with out a doubt one the worse films ever made . 
1	this wartime sitcom written by jimmy perry and david croft ,  who wrote tv's best programme ever dads army ,  was not as good as dads army ,  but still very ,  very funny .   it is about a concert band in india .  most episodes were about bsm williams  ( windsor davies )  trying to get the concert party ,  who he referred to as a bunch of puffs ,  posted up the jungle .  he was always unsuccessful as the vague colonel reynolds  ( donald hewlett )  and the stupid captain ashwood  ( michael knowles )  were big fans of the concert party .  the concert party consisted of bombadier solomans  ( george layton )  ,  ginger rogers impersonator gunner  " gloria "  beaumont  ( melvyn hayes )  ,  university educated piano player gunner  " la de da "  gunner graham ,  a . k . a padarouski  ( john clegg )  ,  singer gunner  " lofty "  sugden ,  gunner parkins  ( christopher mitchell )   ( williams thought parkins was his son ,  he was quite wrong )  ,  big eater gunner  " nosher "  evans and animal impersonator's  ( kenneth macdonald )  ,  he was no percy edwards .  also ,  heavily involved in the adventures were faithful indian servant rangi ram  ( michael bates )  ,  with the char-wallah and the punkah-wallah  ( dino shafeek and babar bhatti )  giving ram wonderful support .    the show ,  just like dads army left many catchphrases .  rangi ram used to say to his punkah wallah  " don't be such clever dickie "  and he ended a lot of the shows saying  " here is a very old hindu proverb e . g when wife is having affair with best friend ,  it doesn't stop your house from catching fire "  it was williams though who had the most catchphrases .  he would always shout  " shuddup !  !  !  !  !  "  ,  say  " oh dear ,  how sad ,  never mind "  and when talking to gunner graham ,  he would always sarcastically talk in a posh accent .   this show doesn't enjoy the same recognition as dads army did .  this is probably due to a question of taste :  this is seen as being crude .  williams is homophobic calling his men  " puffs "  ,  though it has to be said williams is a bore .  also ,  some people think there is a racial element in the humour ,  using the fact that michael bates was blacked up to play rangi ram  ( bates was actually born in india though and spoke urdu before he spoke english )  ,  so the bbc will feel a bit uneasy putting it on ,  even though the vast majority of people who have actually watched the show would agree that the show isn't racist ,  i know someone who is half indian ,  and they weren't the slightest bit offended and agreed like i did that it was a very funny show .  when i see an episode for the first time ,  i laugh probably more than i do for any other sitcom ,  but when i see it second time round ,  i don't laugh all that much ,  but no matter how many times i see dads army ,  i laugh many times in an episode .   best episode :  the road to banu ,  series 1 ,  episode 7
1	dear god where do i begin .  this is bar none the best movie i've ever seen .  the camera angles are great but in my opinion the acting was the best .  why the script writers for this movie aren't writing big budget films i will never understand .  another is the cast .  it is great .  this is the best ted raimi film out there for sure .  i know some of you out there are probably thinking  " no way he has plenty better "  but no your wrong .  raptor island is a work of art .  i hope it should have goten best movie of the year instead of that crappy movie crash with a bunch of no names and no raptors .  i believe this movie is truly the most wonderful thing ever . 
0	this straight-to-video duffer is another nail in the coffin of rick moranis's career .  as is the disney tradition ,  quality is sacrificed in the name of a quick cash-in ;  this is a lazy retread with moranis accidentally shrinking himself and a few relatives so they can repeat all the best scenes from the original movie .  instantly dated visual effects and crummy dialogue abound in this cheesy lamer ,  which did nothing but make me pine for the days of 'the incredible shrinking man' ,  when this kind of thing was done properly .  shockingly ,  this is directed by top cinematographer dean cundey ,  who should either stick to the day job or pick better material next time . 
1	harvey keital's best performance so far the new century .  very nicely photographed ,  a beautiful snap-shot of pre-castro cuba .  the story revolves around the nephew of a local minor crime boss who develops a friendship with an american with hollywood connections .  it's really about the moment when a boy awakens to the fact that the small circle of people he knows actually live in a much larger ,  much more complex world that he doesn't yet understand . the script is strong and filled with humor ,  the direction is crisp .  over all ,  a really professional job that fits in well with the tradition of latin american cinema .  the one weakness is the decision to shoot in sync-sound english rather than spanish - probably to improve sales in the us .  unfortunately ,  this just makes the film a little less convincing .  but if you can see beyond this ,  you will find a heartfelt trip to another world .  recommended . 
0	i'm sure that the folks on the texas/louisiana border must have had a a good laugh or two when paramount's b picture unit inflicted this one on the war time public .  very simply the area along the sabine river where the film opens is cotton country just like the rest of the deep south or at least the deep south was post civl war .  no big cattle empires there ,  they're much farther west in texas ,  farther than richard dix and preston foster could ride to set up their empire .   the film begins with the two of them partners in a riverboat and when leo carrillo tries a theft of their services by not paying them for hauling his cattle ,  they keep the cattle .  and that's the beginning of the big ponderosa like ranch they start .   along the way foster marries dix's sister played by frances gifford and feuds with his much smaller neighbors .  they also have some further run ins with leo carrillo .   anyway ,  us easterners who like westerns usually don't bother with geographical trifles and it's still a good western from the production mill of harry sherman who produced all those hopalong cassidy westerns for paramount .  the climax is a blazing ,  and i mean that literally ,  gun battle that should have maybe been used on an a production .   but i wouldn't have any but western fans look at it . 
0	i wanted to read the other comments before leaving my review and the majority definately rules :  this movie is aweful !  from the acting to the non-realistic animation to the countless errors .  i was actually hoping that the flaps would have been extended by a stretch of the imagination  ( can't extend flaps without engines )  .  the landing gear cannot be lowered unless you have electricity .  that tiny little fan that was going was not sufficient by any stretch to lower the landing gear .  the one thing i thought was quite peculiar is when they landed ,  the back wheels touched down and then the nose one broke off ,  thus suspending the plane with both back tires in the air .  how did the captain apply left and right brakes to tires that weren't touching the ground ?  did they forget the spoilers ?  word to the director :  find out *all* you can about planes before attempting a  " plane "  movie .  sorry for the technical rant ,  but i give this movie 1/10 . 
1	one of the best ensemble acted films i've ever seen .  there isn't much to the plot ,  but the acting- incredible .  you see the characters change ever so subtly ,  undr the influence of the rented villa in italy ,  and love .  and happiness .  the film casts a mesmerizing spell on you ,  much as the villa does on all the women .  truly  " enchanted "  . 
0	this is available on a  " drive in double feature "  from dark sky films ,  and since i just had finished up  " barracuda "  ,  i watched this too .  this is a film that proves to be incredibly ambitious and inept at the same time .   we begin with two young ladies wandering the streets of some foreign town ,  but where exactly are they ?  they stop to look at necklaces from some chinese vendor ,  and try on chinese-style clothes at a shop ,  but then we see some aztec dancers ?  and all the while ,  these girls are being followed by two guys ,  who eventually drop whatever stealth they didn't have to chase the girls on a wild run though the town ,  and they finally catch them .   it seems that one of the girls has a coin on a string around her neck ,  and these guys want to find the loot ,  and where did she get it ?  so ,  in flashback ,  we go back to find out .  and how did they know she had this coin ?  hard to say ,  really .   now ,  back in the day ,  when these two women were 10 years old ,  they were out with their sisters and their sister's boyfriends on a boat ,  and after stopped to get air in their tanks ,  they tow this young boy back to his home dock ,  only to have his grandpa come out & invite the  " young 'uns "  up for herbal tea with granny .  but not everyone has the tea ,  todd has gone back to the boat to check on the young girls ,  and then when they're away from it ,  the boat blows up ,  and when they get back to the house their friends have mysteriously disappeared .  well ,  it seems as though these  " kindly folk "  raise their own vegetables but they wait for the meat to drop by for a spell ,  and serve it herbal tea .   but the girls and todd did leave the island ,  but now ,  they're returning ,  escorted by their captors ,  and they're there to find the treasure ,  despite the fact that no one ever showed the girls where it was before .  there also seems to be someone else on the island ,  and the thugs mysteriously begin to die ,  one by one ,  and since there's only three ,  it doesn't take long .  and there's even a sort of happy ending ,  which will leave the viewer every bit as baffled as they were throughout the rest of the film .   the two thugs seem to be speed freaks with anger issues ,  and combined with no acting ability they're borderline hilarious .  the hillbilly-type family is also devoid of acting ability ,  despite the fact that the grandpa is hank worden ,  who appeared in many films and tv shows .  the action is confusing ,  the locales are even more confusing ,  and the island looks like southern california .   so what the hell is this ?  i'm not sure ,  but it certainly is worth seeing once so you can think  ( or say )  ,  huh ?  4 out of 10 ,  very bizarre . 
0	this early role for barbara shelley ( in fact , her first in britain after working in italy )  , was made when she was 24 years old , and it's certainly safe to say that she made a stunning debut in 1957's  " cat girl .  "  while blondes and brunettes get most of the attention ( i'll always cherish yutte stensgaard )  , the lovely auburn-haired actress with the deep voice always exuded intelligence as well as vulnerability ( one such example being 1960's  " village of the damned ,  "  in which her screen time was much less than her character's husband , george sanders )  . she is the sole reason for seeing this drab update of  " cat people ,  "  and is seen to great advantage throughout ( it's difficult to say if her beauty found an even better showcase )  . her character apparently sleeps in the nude , and we are exposed to her luscious bare back when she is awakened ( also exposed 8 years later in 1965's  " rasputin-the mad monk "  )  . the ravishing gown she wears during most of the film is a stunning strapless wonder ( i don't see what held that dress up , but i'd sure like to )  . all in all , proof positive that barbara shelley , in a poorly written role that would defeat most actresses , rises above her material and makes the film consistently watchable , a real test of star power , which she would find soon enough at hammer's studios in bray , for the duration of the 1960's . 
1	from the beginning of the show carmen was there .  she was one of the best characters .  why did they get rid of her ?  !  the show not the same as before .  its way worse .   the best episodes were with carmen in them .  you can't replace someone from the beginning !  that is like south park without kyle or child's play without chucky !  it's not right !  the niece who replaced her is just ,  ugh !  awful .  she doesn't fit into the storyline at all .  she was one of the main characters ,  and the niece can't replace her .  she was an awesome actress .  way better than the niece .  get her back ,  or you'll lose a ton of viewers . 
1	 " the haunted world of edward d .  wood ,  jr .  "  is the definitive documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as  " glen or glenda "  ,   " bride of the monster "  ,  and ,  of course ,   " plan 9 from outer space "  .  this exquisite film far exceeds where other documentaries ,  such as  " look back in angora "  and  " the plan 9 companion "  ,  failed .  it rounds up his surviving entourage ,  many of whom have passed away since filming ,  and gives an honest examination of ed wood and his work .  nostalgic in the fact that it looks back at the darker corner of yesteryear hollywood ,  sentimental in its treatment of the director  ( down to the haunting music )  ,  this documentary is an absolute must-see for anyone who loves the director who so failed in his day .  the entire two hours of the film lovingly and retrospectively pieces together ed's life and untimely death for the viewer .  best watched at 3 am while wearing an angora sweater . 
0	okay ,  'enjoy' is a pretty relative term ,  but flexibility is in order when you're dealing with a filmmaker of james glickenhaus' calibre .   mcbain is truly one of the most ridiculous ,  over the top action films i've ever seen ,  without the nasty edge of the exterminator .  other reviews have commented on a suspension of disbelief regarding the film's heroic middle aged commandos ,  but how about making a film in the philippines that is set in colombia ?  all the extras are filipino .  in fact the only character who looks remotely hispanic is good ol' victor argo as the much reviled 'el presidente' !  oh yes ,  we also have maria conchita alonso overemoting like crazy as a rebel leader .  there are tons of explosions and bodies flying everywhere in this amusing paean to the glories of american imperialism . 
1	although the movie is clearly dated ,  audiences can still easily identify with the plight of hapless buster in this timeless and very funny underdog tale .  buster fights against unkindly odds in three different ages :  the stone age ,  the roman age ,  and the moden age ,  playing almost the same character with just a change of scenery to help us identify the different  " ages "  .  in this movie we see one of the earliest comedic depictions of the  " caveman "  stereotype ,  who wins his love not by romance but by brute force ,  as well as a funny twist on roman gladiatorial combat ,  two comedic sketches that long predate such spoofs as mel brooks'  " history of the world :  part i "  .  the underlying theme of the movie is simple yet convincing :  although the times may have-a-changed ,  we still face the same struggles even in modern times that we fought in prehistoric times in order to  " win the girl "   ( keep in mind this is the theme of 1923 america ,  a time when chauvinism was still en vogue )  .  it is interesting to look at this movie over eighty years later ,  and consider how dramatically things have changed from this movie's  " modern times "  to now . 
0	i couldn't believe that this movie dates from 2007 ,  it had all the looks of a below-average seventies horror-flick .  didn't they have any knowledge of modern special effects or cgi ?  !  ?  didn't they know that in the post-millennium the violence in a supposed horror- and/or scifi-movie should at least be a little bit graphic ?  or did i get the purpose wrong ,  was it supposed to be a deep and meaningful story of man and animal ,  bound together in the big cycle of life ,  or a warning to mankind not to mess with nature ,  or something like that ?  ?  it doesn't really matter ,  either way it turned out wrong and to me this movie failed on all accounts .   first of all :  the premise is very improbable .  if at a given time you're capable of replacing a total eye ,  no responsible medical scientist would start his very first human attempt with both eyes at the same time ,  that's totally unprofessional .  and to do all this apparently without informed consent of the patient ?  !  and why on earth choose for eyes that have a totally unusual color for humans ,  and make the victim look like a freak ?  !  by the way ,  i noticed that all the real wolves in the movie had puppy-like normal dark eyes ,  couldn't they have waited for such a specimen ?  the story is lame ,  it's about this poor guy aaron who gets these weird eye-transplants ,  which suddenly makes him feel like the donor-wolf  ( or at least ,  that's what i make of it )  and then he's being chased by some military men .  especially this last bit is ridiculous .  i mean ,  i can understand that the army is interested in the results of the experiment  ( imagine soldiers with night-vision eye-sight !  )  but as the operation fails on account of the apparent nervous breakdown of the patient ,  it's beyond me why they're out to kill him .  why not leave him alone and look for another usable recipient ?   ( a volunteering soldier maybe ?  ?  )  .  and why try to kill everyone else that's involved with poor aaron ,  isn't that a bit steep ?  !  who the hell are these militaries anyway ,  i hope not the us army or the government ,  they behave like psychopaths ,  walking around the hospital waving automatic weapons ,  raiding private apartments like they're after some public enemy # 1 ,  and displaying during the ultimate show-down in the woods a total lack of discipline ,  like a bunch of frightened schoolchildren ,  panicking and shooting randomly around .   aaron ,  for some unfathomable medical reason ,  feels like a wolf after the transplantation of the eyes .  why would that be ?  ?  ?  he suddenly sees visions of wandering wolves .  what is this ?  are we supposed to believe that the memories of the donor-wolf are situated in it's eye-balls ?  !  ?  and that the recipient of these eye-balls also adopts the wolf's craving for red  ( life- )  meat and can jump off of a 30 feet high balcony and land unharmed on his all-fours like a cat  ( can a wolf even do that ?  ?  !  )  .   the acting  ( or the lack thereof )  didn't help the credibility of all this either :  everyone stumbles through their lines like wooden dolls ,  especially this indian girl ,  she may be pretty but she can only come up with one expression  ( vexed )  and some disinterested mumblings about the force of nature ,  and it beats me why aaron all of a sudden is all over her  ( but hey ,  there probably had to be at least one love-scene !  )  .  i really sympathized with actor cory monteith ,  who seems like a nice guy with a handsome enough face ,  but they didn't give him much to go with .  he has to run around bare-chested for more than half of the movie ,  which could have been fun to watch ,  but then they had better chosen someone with a more impressive physique ,  monteith really should leave his shirt on .  his  ( few )  killings and attacks are hardly shown ,  we just hear some growling and cries of fear and then there's another victim lying down and aaron with some more blood on his face and chest .  not much for a modern sci-fi horror !  the only good acting came from justine bateman ,  and i really like to see how she has matured into a beautiful and classy forty-something lady .  she did what she could with her silly lines and she even convinced me of being this doctor with good intentions ,  but they made her character a kind of a wimp ,  who gets totally bossed around by the leader of these militaries .  what a pity that the script didn't make her stand up a bit more !    in the end this sums up as being a silly and rather boring movie ,  hardly scary or thrilling ,  with unbelievable goings-on ,  a lot of overlong national geographic-like visuals of wolves running around woods and slopes  ( who cares ?  !  ?  )  ,  some pretentious indian ramblings about man and nature and an uneven musical score with poppy songs at the most inappropriate moments .  i guess the word  " superfluous "  covers it all . 
0	woody allen has made some of the greatest comedies ever and i would seriously consider saying that annie hall is the greatest movie ever but if i really think about it i will probably think of one or two that are better ,  but it would be hard .  he has had of course some films that aren't quite good but not that bad either like manhattan murder mystery and sweet and lowdown but he has never before had a film quite as bad as melinda and melinda .  not quite so tired and so unfunny ,  his films are usually witty and hilarious but how did this happen ,  is it still our good old woody ?  the plot runs around four friends who are having dinner together .  two are play writers and one of the others mentions a funny story that happened to a friend of hers .  it is about a young woman who bursts in on a dinner party unexpected .  we never hear the rest because the two play writes start to debate whether it would make a better comedy or tragedy .  than we begin to see the two points of view .  both center on this woman named melinda who is having trouble both with drugs and with her ex-husband .  in the tragedy she is an old family friend who after attempting suicide decided to show up at her old best friends front door for no apparent reason .  the comedy is about melida who stumbles in on the dinner party after popping 28 sleeping pills .  both go on a wild whirl wind of events that never really make sense or fit together ,  or make you laugh more than once or twice .  there are some nice performances by radha mitchell and will ferrell but they can't fit it together on there own .  they cam't stop it from sinking farther down than most of the other films this year . 
0	as an army veteran ,  i was deeply offended by this film .  in my opinion ,  it is a disgrace to those who fought in the vietnam war .  to say that the real sf soldiers i knew were offended by this crap is an understatement .  if the film were presented as satire or even as a cartoon  ( it was )  ,  it would have been better received .  but it was taken seriously my many people ,  especially overseas .  silly as it sounds ,  wherever i went in europe in the late 80's people seemed to judge me and americans in general by this film .  unrealistic ?  hmm ,  let's see .  a monosyllabic ,  muscle-bound cretin is pulled off a prison work gang to go on a secret mission to se asia to free some american pow's .  in a running battle he kills about 500 enemy soldiers with an m-60 machine gun that never runs out of ammo and never overheats .  and he never misses ,  running with a 32lb gun held up with one arm .  i could go on ,  but i'm getting a headache .  i gave this a 2/10 only because it's slightly better than rambo iii . 
0	after watching this ,  i had lost a little respect for christopher lee  ( this has passed over time )  .  this film was utter garbage .  first ,  they tried to recreate the ending from the first  " howling ,  "  with incredibly bad make-up .  then they try to turn it into a sad excuse of a werewolf porn film !  the plot sucks and the whole film is just awful !  !  !  !  a brother of a werewolf victim from the first film  ( from the look of it ,  it was supposed to be dee wallace stone ) teams up with lee and another woman to destroy the group of werewolves ,  lead by sybil danning ,  who seems to be naked all the time .   this is not even worth renting  ( unless you want to waste your time and money watching the nudity .  )  .  try to catch it on cable instead .  it would be so chopped up ,  it may actually make sense . 
1	well i don't personally like rap ,  but i still found fear of a black hat hilarious .  i'm sure i didn't get some inside jokes ,  but some i knew ,  and it was funny enough to make me laugh just after i'd stopped laughing .  i'm a big fan of spinal tap ,  so naturally i had to check this out .  it was deriviative from this is spinal tap ,  sometimes blatantly ,  but this film still stood on it's own as an original ,  intelligent ,  and funny satire .  my personal favorite :   " back in the time of slaves ,  they didn't have hats to protect them from the sun ,  so at the end of the day they were too tired to revolt .  now we have hats .  " 
1	it does seem like this film is polarizing us .  you either love it or hate it .  i loved it .   i agree with the comment ( s )  that said ,  you just gotta  " feel "  this one .   also ,  early in the film ,  tom cruise shows his girlfriend a painting done by monet--an impressionist painter .  monet's style is to paint in little dabs so up close the painting looks like a mess ,  but from a distance ,  you can tell what the subject is .  cruise mentions that the painting has a  " vanilla sky "  .  i believe this is a hint to the moviegoer .  this movie is like that impressionist painting .  it's impressionist filmmaking !  and it's no coincidence that the title of the movie refers to that painting .   this is not your typical linear plot .  it requires more thought .  there is symbolism and there are scenes that jump around and no ,  you're not always going to be sure what's going on .  but at the end ,  all is explained .   you will need to concentrate on this movie but i think people are making the mistake of concentrating way too hard on it .  after it ends is when you should think about it .  if you try to figure it out as it's unfolding ,  you will overwhelm yourself .  just let it happen .  .  .  " go "  with it .  .  . keep an open mind .  remember what you see and save the analysis for later .   i found all the performances top notch and thought it to be tremendously unique ,  wildly creative ,  and spellbinding .   but i will not critize the intelligence of those of you who didn't enjoy it .  it appeals to a certain taste .  if you like existential ,  psychedelic ,  philosophical ,  thought-provoking ,  challenging ,  spiritual movies ,  then see it .  if you prefer something a little lighter ,  then skip it .   but if you do like what i described ,  then you will surely enjoy it . 
1	by dane youssef    " coonskin "  is film ,  by the one and only ralph bakshi ,  is reportedly a satirical indictment of blaxploitation films and negative black stereotypes ,  as well as a look at life black in modern america  ( modern for the day ,  i mean--1975 )  .  paramount dropped it like a hot potato that just burst into flame .   but this is a bakshi film ,  controversial ,  thrilling ,  and a must-see almost by definition alone .  not just another random  " shock-jock "  of a movie which tries to shock for the sake of shock .  it's by ralph bakshi .  anyone who knows the name knows that if he made a movie ,  he has something big to say .  .  .   although it's roots are based in cheap blaxploitation ,   " coonskin "  isn't just another campy knock-off of mainstream white film or any kind of throwaway flick .   " coonskin "  wants to be more .  it aims it's sights higher and fries some much bigger fish .   the movie doesn't just poke fun at the genre .  nor does it just indict black people ,  but actually seems to show love ,  beauty and heart in the strangest places .    " coonskin "  tells a story out of some convicts awaiting a jail-break .  the fact that it's even possible to break out of a prison in the  " coonskin "  world alone makes it old-fashioned .   one of the inmates tells a story about a trio of black brothers in harlem named brother bear ,  brother rabbit ,  preacher fox who want respect and a piece of the action and are willing to get it by any means necessary .  the itallian mob is running all the real action .   big name black musicians star :  barry white and scatman crothers ,  as well as charles gordone ,  the first black playwright to take home the pulitzer .  something big is happening here obviously .   the movie plays out like a descent into this world ,  this side of the racial divide .  from an angry ,  hip ,  deep ,  soulful black man with a hate in his heart and a gun in his hand .   bakshi's films never know the meaning of the word  " sublety .  "  this one looks like it's never even heard of the word .  but maybe a subject like this needs extremism .  real sledgehammer satire .  some subjects can't be tackled gently .   bakshi is god-dammed merciless .  here ,  no member or minority of the harlem scene appears unscathed .   the characters here are  " animated "  to  " real "  all depending on what the mood and situation are .  the animated characters and the human ones all share the same reality and are meant to be taken just as literally .   bakshi never just shows ugly caricatures just for shock value .  he always has something to say .  nor is black-face is gratuitously .  here ,  unlike in spike lee's  " bamboozled ,  "  he seems to be using it to try and really say something .   like 99 . 9% of all of bakshi's films ,  this one incorporates animation and live-action .  usually at the same time .  bakshki isn't just being gimmicky here .  all of this technique is all intertwined ,  meshing together while saying something .   somehow ,  this one feels inevitably dated .  many of these types of films  ( bakshi's included )  are very topical ,  very spur of the moment .  they reflect the certain trend for the day ,  but looking back of them years later ,  there's just an unmistakable feeling of nostalgia  ( as well as timeless truth )  .   even though the music ,  clothes ,  slang and the city clearly looks like photos that belong in a time capsule ,  the attitude ,  the spirit and the heart remain the same no matter what f--king ear it is .  anyone who's really seen the movies ,  the state of things and has been in company of the people know what i'm talking about .   even some of the of the black characters are a bunny  ( junglebunny )  ,  a big ol' bear and a fox .  one of the most sour and unsavory racist characters is a dirty harlem cop who's hot on the trail of these  " dirty n-----s "  after the death of a cop .  but for him ,  it's not just business .  nor is it for the rest of the brothers who wear the shield .  it's just pure sadistic racist pleasure of hurting blacks .   the sequence involving the godfather and his lady is one of the most moving pieces in the whole film ,  of which there are many .  it plays out like an opera or a ballet .   the promo line :  warning :   " this film offends everybody !  "  this is not just hype .  proceed with extreme caution .   you have been warned .  .  .   by dane youssef
0	the main character lance barton gets killed and to heaven before his time .  when heaven learns about the mistake he is given the body of just deceased rich old and white mr .  wellington .   a young black guy in a old white mans body still behaving like the young black man is maybe funny if you see it done by an old white actor .  in this movie i ended up reminding myself several times :   " chris rock is supposed to be an old white guy "  .   the whole concept does not play as intended :  the  " illusion "  is not transported well and the love story is not believable at all .  the fact that all you see is chris rock playing a young black guy ,  because the old white person everyone is supposed to see is only shown in small scenes ,  is to much of a challenge for the viewers  " suspension of disbelief "  . 
1	absolutely wonderful drama and ros is top notch .  .  . i highly recommend this movie .  her performance ,  in my opinion ,  was academy award material !  the only real sad fact here is that universal hasn't seen to it that this movie was ever available on any video format ,  whether it be tape or dvd .  they are ignoring a very good movie .  but universal has little regard for its library on dvd ,  which is sad .  if you get the chance to see this somewhere  ( not sure why it is rarely even run on cable )  ,  see it !  i won't go into the story because i think most people would rather have an opinion on the film ,  and too many  " reviewers "  spend hours writing about the story ,  which is available anywhere .   a 10 ! 
0	the plot of corpse grinders 2 is very much similar to the original corpse grinders ,  what is left that is different from the other film consists of weird aliens .   it is my belief that this film would be the #1 worst film on imdb - if anyone had actually watched it .  the plot is disconnected and ,  in several  ( way too many )  instances ,  makes absolutely no sense whatsoever .  the real wonder here is why in the world was this sequel created to such an unsuccessful and horrendous  ( but still somewhat better )  film .   i would highly recommend this film if you enjoy watching terrible movies for a good laugh . 
0	saw this movie in an early preview ,  and i cannot stress enough how bad i thought this film was .  from the very beginning ,  the audience was groaning over pacino's awful southern accent .  poor al looked really ,  really haggard ,  and i can't decide whether this was purposely part of his role as a drug addicted publicist ,  or perhaps he just didn't get any sleep before coming to the set .  much worse than pacino's close ups ,  however ,  is the wretched excuse for a plot .  early in the film we are given indications that pacino's character is gay ,  and i suspect that is what the screenwriter had originally intended .  later ,  however ,  we are supposed to suspend our incredulity and believe that both tea leoni and kim basinger  ( both of whom are sleepwalking through lame roles )  lust after this elderly ,  half dead looking ,  effeminate man with the ridiculous accent .  the worst part overall was the main plot thread ,  which had to do with some corporate espionage that is never fully explained and we never ,  ever care about in the slightest .  because this was a preview i will reserve my final judgment ,  because of the possibility of re-shoots and editing ,  but you can bet i will not pay a cent to see this in theaters . 
0	oh god , what an idiotic movie ! incredibly cheap with fake special effects ( the creature is played by one guy in lame costume ) and stupid plot . all dialogues are unbelievably bad and these actors ( ha ! ha ! ha !  )  .  .  . they're simply ludicrous . for example i have never seen so annoying characters like in this junk ( these dumb kids or pregnant woman with his husband and many more )  . all in all , this is a great entertainment if you're drunk . avoid it like the plague . am i drunk ? i don't think so .  .  . 
0	in a movie that follows a struggling actor ,  played ,  evidently ,  by a struggling actor ,  this does no favours for chris klein .  he struggles to bring anything memorable to the role and meanders on through the shallow script managing to display ,  what could only be described as ,  a bland leading man .  the story exists ,  but that is all ,  and fails to show any basic start ,  middle and end and the viewer is left shrugging his shoulders feeling as though nothing in the past hour and three quarters has really happened .   one bright light in the midst of this is fred durst ,  who manages to stand out above his seemingly averagely talented co-stars and does a semi-decent job of bringing the backward character of legde to life .  whether fred can re-create this when working with a higher calibre of cast remains to be seen but i'l be watching out for him in future . 
1	such energy and vitality .  you just can't go wrong with busby berkley films and this certainly must be his best .  of course the choreography is wonderful ,  but also the banter between cagney and blondell is so colorful and such a delight .  don't miss this one . 
0	and that comes from someone that will withstand almost any viewing .  the acting and sound is awful .  this might qualify for a  " so bad it's good "  point of merit ,  ,  , for some .  however i take my horror movies seriously and this is just crap-it's just soooo cheap ,  i think that's my major complaint .  the dialogue is often hilarious-attention to how many times  " you startled me "  is used .  the  " child "  actress is seriously god awful-i pray her acting career ended here .  . her line  " donuts !  i hate donuts "  is worth repeated viewing however . 
1	while this movie has many flaws ,  it is in fact a fun '80s movie .  eddie murphy peaks during his 80's movies here .  while his character is indistinguishable from earlier movies ,  his timing is almost flawless with perfect partners and foils .   couple this with the hypnotic beauty of charlotte lewis ,  this makes for a fun rainy day action-comedy flick .   
1	despite the title ,  the sword bearer ,  and the dvd cover  ( action/herioc poses of the sword bearer )  this is not a super hero film .    ( minor spoilers )  it follows the tale of sasha ,  the sword bearer ,  who is cursed with having a retractable sword in his forearm .  cool you say ,  but no ,  this is real life .  if you had this power as a child could you control it when ,  say ,  faced by a mad man ,  or when your mum's boyfriend is beating her .  and if you don't control it ,  how do you cope with being a two time killer at the age of 12 .   this essentially is where sasha is when we meet him .  wandering aimlessly after another killing  ( much like a bout de soufflé )  .  he then meet katya ,  and the pair fall instantly in love ,  providing sasha with a real reason to live and try and changes his ways .  however ,  his past is still chasing him ,  in the form of two police officers .   that is essentially the story ,  and there is virtually no action on screen ,  though a lot if suggested .   i really like this movie .  unlike many hollywood 'super hero' films ,  we get very little back story ,  there is no bad guy  ( unless you count the sword bearer himself )  abut there is a lot of heart and good character development .   worth checking out if you can find it . 
1	loved the movie .  loved the two families crossing paths in history .  only question is if sam gets killed then how does his family's line continue ?  he is madame zeroni's son and zero is supposed to be related but no mention of any other children ?  hmmmmmmmmm .  never mentioned any other children or wife prior to his speaking with and falling in love with the teacher ?  maybe she had a child prior to becoming the kissing kate bandit ?  even with the mistakes in the movie .  just loved it .  the acting was great .  not sure where the story was with mr .  sir being marion a women at the end but makes his character even funnier .  the other  " counseler "  did seem concerned for the kids but of course maybe not so much .  poor warden must have had a really stinky childhood to be so mean when she grew up . 
1	the opening sequence alone is worth the cost of admission ,  as cheech and chong drag that big ol garbage can across the parking lot ,  filled with gas .   " don't spill it man  !  "  ,  hilarious stuff .  and then ,  as 'the plot' ensues ,  you're in for one heck of a ride .  i watched this film recently and it holds up ,  being just as funny upon each viewing .  check it out . 
0	firstly ,  there are some good things about this film ,  but it's all cliche slasher stuff combined with a teen movie .  in the advertising of this movie ,  that i've seen ,  a large emphasis was on the fact that denise richards is in it ,  but she's a poor actress ,  and not as good looking as people try to make her out to be  ( not that that has anything to do with the movie )  .  and what's with that look she gives everyone ?  perhaps it's part of the character ,  but like i said ,  the acting .  .  .  still ,  the writing is fine .  you know who it is all throughout the movie ,  and you can almost predict what is about to happen ,  but not in an irritating way .  i think the book it's based on is probably good ,  judging by the plot line ,  but next time i'll read the book to find out rather than watch this . 
0	the only reason to give this movie even a single star is how much the ending made me laugh .  i had high hopes as i usually love bad campy holiday horror movies ,  but this just didn't qualify .  it's really just a bad attempt at showing a character slide slowly into insanity ,  which again ,  isn't a bad plot ,  but is done poorly here .  there are some scenes  ( such as the ending )  which are not intended to be funny ,  but actually made me laugh out loud .  there were a couple of times when i thought the movie would actually go in an interesting direction ,  but it never fulfills what it could and should be .  in my opinion ,  if you are looking for a christmas slasher flick ,  try silent night ,  deadly night . 
0	i have seen about a thousand horror films .   ( my favorite type )  this film is among the worst .  for me ,  an idea drives a movie .  so ,  even a poorly acted ,  cheaply made movie can be good .  something weird is definitely cheaply made .  however ,  it has little to say .  i still don't understand what the karate scene in the beginning has to do with the film .  something weird has little to offer .  save yourself the pain ! 
0	ming the merciless does a little bardwork and a movie most foul ! 
1	the acting is pretty cheesy ,  but for the people in this area up in the 80s and are now detroit area automotive engineers ,  this is a great movie .  i even work with a japanese supplier so that makes this movie even more funny .   jay leno was showing his age last night on the tonight show !  he looks pretty young here .  .  . 17 years ago .  the opening scene ,  with the drag race on what appears to be woodward ave was great .   leno also owns some bad a** cars now ,  it would e great to see a remake of this with his modern collection .  i'm sure the blown vette in the opening scene was his own car .   typical 80s movie .  watch it and enjoy .  no computer generated crap ! 
0	terrible !  !  !  i don't want to be too negative but this film has an iq of stupid monkey . what a disaster . i just couldn't believe how bad this movie is . the dialogs are just very strange and off topic , the camera work at times just horrible , the music at times like a soundtrack for lawrence of arabia , i just watched this film to see how much worse it can get . some of the side kick  " actors "  are total disaster . sorry but all my thumbs and toes and anything that can hang downwards on my body is falling to the ground .  harvey keitle is a great actor but who knows maybe he is in financial crunch to take a part in such a fiasco film .   .   .   .   .  this movie should have been presented to all the students in all the film schools just to teach them a lesson of how not to make a film
0	dull haunted house thriller finds an american family moving into a 200 year old house in japan where a violent murder suicide love triangle occurred .    novel setting is about the only element of interest in this very slow moving horror flick by the director of motel hell .  the film generates zero suspense and is composed of somewhat choppy scenes that rarely seem to be leading anywhere overall .    one obvious example is a fairly early scene where the male lead visits a temple after realizing that his house is haunted as the monk had earlier warned .  the monk recounts the history of the house  ( which the viewer is already familiar with from the opening sequence )  and then the film simply cuts away to something else .  earlier the monk had offered to help .  well ,  where is the help ?  the family continues to stay in the haunted house as things get worse and worse and no mention of the monk is made until nearly the very end when he turns up again to do what he should have done an hour earlier--try to drive the spirits out of the house ,  although by this time it's difficult for the viewers to care .   there are some  ( probably )  unintentional campy laughs in seeing the american actors at the end become possessed by the japanese spirits and suddenly start doing bad martial arts ,  i say probably because the scene is more than a little reminiscent of the chainsaw duel from the same director's motel hell which was more obviously meant to be amusing ,  but on the whole this is a forgettable dud . 
1	yes ,  the cameras were in the right place at the right time .  it's so interesting to see how a world leader  ( like chavez )  who supports the poor people in his country ,  can be held in such low esteem in the us .  his worst  " sin "  ,  in my opinion ,  is caring about those who are at the bottom of the barrel .  what can be so bad about that ?  i have always been fascinated by the us government+media reaction to fidel castro .  at first ,  castro was a good guy  ( around 1959 )  when he supplanted batista .  soon ,  however ,  castro started turning the corporations in cuba toward the needs of the poor instead of the fat cats .  we're a decent country ,  but why does our media and government have such a problem with sharing with the poor ?  if these guys are  " dictators ,  "  then we could use more  " dictatorships "  especially where the poorest of the poor live in the world . 
0	as is often the case ,  films about self-loathing characters do not usually make for good drama .  'downloading nancy' is no exception .  it's supposedly based on a true story about a woman who's murdered at her own request by someone she meets over the internet .   the protagonist is nancy  ( maria bello )  who is married to albert  ( rufus sewell )  .  albert is a successful software developer who has developed a golf game which his company has successfully marketed to various bars and bar/restaurants .  unlike most human beings ,  albert has virtually no positive attributes  ( except for his ability to be successful in the business world )  .  throughout the film ,  albert has a grim and dour expression on his face .  he has no sympathy for his wife with all her emotional problems and resorts to patronizing prostitutes .  when his wife asks for sex ,  he punishes her by masturbating in her presence instead .   nancy is equally one-note as a character .  not only has she had a loveless 15 year marriage but was sexually abused by her uncle when she was growing up  ( thankfully there are no flashbacks of that back story in the film )  .  her self-loathing takes the form of self-mutilation and a result ,  she's forced into therapy .  however ,  she has such contempt for her therapist that no progress can be made .   finally ,  nancy is so depressed that she contacts louis over the internet .  he's sort of a sadomasochistic gigolo ,  who has sex with women for money while inflicting massive amounts of pain to boot .  it's revealed that louis has two children but no longer sees them  ( the children's mother no longer wants anything to do with him )  .   nancy's plan is to first have painful sex with louis and then have him kill her .  there's a particularly unpleasant scene where louis has sex with nancy while slashing her vaginal area with a broken piece of glass .  these scenes are shown as flashbacks after louis pays a visit to albert who ties him up and strikes him with a golf club .  it seems that louis has a two-fold plan in going to see albert :  1 )  berate him for his treatment of nancy and 2 )  enjoy the beating he receives .  it takes awhile before louis will reveal nancy's fatefirst ,  he forces albert to do him the favor of taking his dog to a relative so someone will care for it in the future .  nancy's fate of course is that louis finally ended up choking her to death  ( but showed some hesitation first as he made it clear that he had some 'feelings' for her )  .  we soon learn that louis is imprisoned for life for nancy's murder .   what exactly are we to take away from a film such as downloading nancy ?  are we supposed to feel sorry for victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence ?  is that the main point of the film ?  is sympathy for nancy actually warranted ?  i don't think so .  the film's writers create a straw man in the character of albertsomeone who is so cut off from his emotions that he is the one that is held responsible for nancy's decline .  but are people so one-dimensional in real life ?  i think not .  they have the repulsive louis ,  a man who makes a living by inflicting pain ,  come over and berate albert for neglecting nancy .  furthermore ,  his expressions of love towards nancy  ( before he kills her )  ,  is supposed to show his 'sensitive side' .   in the end ,  it matters little whether the filmmakers have defined where their sympathies lie with the various characters in the film .  they are so bent on titillating their audience with scenes of gratuitous violence ,  that downloading nancy becomes nothing more than an exercise in poor taste and soft pornography . 
0	 " scary movie 2 "  is a let down to the scary movie franchise .  scary movie 1 ,  3 and 4 were all good but this one was kind of boring and not very funny .  luckily they picked their act up after this one and made two more great scary movies .   this film is about a group of teens who get tricked by their professor into going to a haunted mansion for a night .  things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escape .   this movie isn't horrible but they could have improved quite a few things .  it is a bit of fun and if you liked the other movies in the scary movie franchise then give this a watch - but i don't think you will like it nearly as much . 
0	a different look at horror .  the styling differences between american and russian films is interesting .  however from my american perspective this movie just wasn't that good .  the protagonist ,  marie played by anastasia hille wasn't a pleasant character and i had a hard time identifying with her .  she was disagreeable most of the time and confused for much of what little time was left .  also too much time was spent in bringing her to the main location of the film .  then a long time passed before any real suspense built up .  once that happened it seemed volume was used as the main effect which was more annoying than anything else .  the concept was more original than most direct-to-video movies and they didn't use sex to make up for a thin plot .  all in all i'd recommend it for renting ,  but not for theater goers . 
1	despite what others had said  ( *cough* )  ,  this is my favourite movie of all time .  i don't know how long i had been waiting to see it ,  but once i finally did ,  i immediately fell in love .  sure ,  it's strange ,  but that just gives it more of an exciting flavour .  for those who don't know ,  moonchild is one of gackt and hyde's first movies .  they haven't done very many at all ,  maybe 3 or 4 tops each .  so ,  give them some credit .  we all know that adam sandler wasn't the best at first either .  i do believe that they do throw some odd situations in there ,  but i over look that to find the best points of this movie ,  the emotions displayed and whatnot .  therefore ,  i have given ,  and always shall give ,  this movie a 10 out of 10 . 
1	the scenes are fast-paced .  the characters are great .  i love anne-marie johnson's acting .  i really like the ending .    however ,  i was disappointed that this movie didn't delve deeper into achilles's and athena's relationship .  it only blossomed when they kissed each other . 
1	not a bad film .  somehow i was made to actually root for the iranians to win the game played in the movie even though i don't know anything about soccer and am not a fan .  the ending on the bus was exhilarating .   the film itself deals with the issue of women in iran ,  and how they are not allowed to go into sporting arenas amongst men because their swearing is inappropriate for women to hear .  despite this law ,  some women try to sneak in ,  but many of them get caught and detained .  it's really astonishing that any society could still have such antiquated notions of gender .  in an interview ,  panahi says his films are documents of history and its injustices ,  and that one day in the future we can watch these movies and see how iran once lived .  one hopes that future will come sooner rather than later . 
0	though the movie may have been  " true "  to lewis's book  ( in that the script was basically word-for-word ,  verbatim )  ,  it failed to capture any of the grandeur that would otherwise be associated with an epic story like this .  the mythical creatures  ( unicorns ,  centaurs ,  griffins ,  ghouls ,  ghosts )  are *drawn* in ,  and as in the previous review ,  the green-screen flying sequence was very hard to swallow .  i nearly laughed to death when i saw the humanoid beavers with their giant stiff suits and buck teeth ;  i nearly cried when i heard the wolf's  " howl-- "  a man in a grey fuzzy suit basically shrieking as loudly and as girlishly as he possibly could .   all of the acting is tremendously forced ,  especially that of little lucy penvensie .  .  .  i could only take so much indignation ,  desperation ,  and buck teeth in the  ( what felt like )  fourteen hours of watching the movie .  the actress who plays the white witch ,  in all her histrionics ,  seems that she'd be more at home on stage ,  where a booming voice ,  spread arms ,  and a valiant effort at something shakespearian would be more than welcome .    the sets feel claustrophobic ,  whether the scenes are taking place indoors or outdoors .  indoors ,  it's as if bbc could only afford to spend $100 on constructing a set ,  and so it is very small ,  and all the characters are constantly huddled together .  the white witch's castle is a run-down ,  rotting countryside english castle filled with styrofoam statues and bad lighting .  when the penvensie children are wandering through the woods-- actually ,  *any* scene in the woods-- feels like they are simply wandering around in circles .    the only thing that looks decent in the film is aslan ,  but you can bet that bbc probably blew the film's entire budget on building the mechanical feline .  it looks great when it's standing still and before it starts speaking ,  but once it starts moving ,  you can't help but pity the poor man who has to be the rear-end in the lion suit .    yes ,  if you are a hardcore narnia fan ,  you may want to see this version ,  simply because it preserves every word that lewis ever wrote-- but lewis was certainly no screenwriter ,  and a lot of the dialogue feels chunky and awkward when on screen .  during the scene in which the children are at the beavers' and getting ready to flee from the wolves ,  mrs .  beaver's incessant ,   " oh ,  just one more thing ,  dearies ,  and then we will be ready to go ,  "  punctuated by the children's simultaneous cries and sighs and moans of  " no ,  mrs .  beaver ,  please !  "  -- a scene of comic relief ,  so incongruous  ( they are supposed to be fleeing from imminent danger ,  not wondering about whether to pack the sewing machine or not )  ,  detracts from the drama that the scene might otherwise have .  in fact ,  the whole movie is peppered with directing faux pas such as these .    i would recommend seeing the new narnia  ( disney 2005 )  .  the new movie ,  with updated effects ,  spectacular computer animation ,  great timing all around ,  and a gorgeous and scene- stealing white witch  ( who plays her part with all the subtle evil of a seasoned politician ,  as opposed to a shrieking banshee )  captures all of the grandeur and the magnificence of the world of narnia without detracting the least bit from lewis's original vision  ( i think )  .  lucy is a lot cuter  ( no buck teeth ,  yay !  )  ,  as are the beavers  ( and realistically-sized )  ,  and bratty bbc edmund has nothing on the divine ,  desperately-hungry-for-acceptance-insecure-and- angsting-with-an-inferiority-complex edmund that the new disney version fronts .    unless you're the type who enjoys wasting time by making fun of campy movies ,  i would not recommend this film to anyone . 
1	as i said in my comment about the first part :  these two movies are better than most science fiction fans confess .   the scenario in the second movie is not that moving as we don't see the destruction of human civilization ,  but the aftermath ,  thousands of refugees fleeing in tiny space cans ,  protected by only one powerful spaceship .   but when battlestar pegasus appears ,  the story heats up ,  carrying the battle back to the cylon planets .  okay ,  it has a little bit of mad max because all they fight for is fuel for their spaceships to travel on to find the distant earth ,  but it works for me .  it is thrilling science fiction entertainment featuring fine actors and decent special effects  ( even though those tend to repeat themselves ,  to say the least  : - )   )  .   i would have loved a continuation with starbuck and apollo on board .  instead ,  we got a second sequel with no name characters who proved that the story had worked before especially because the feature characters were so well-chosen .  .  .   so thumbs down for the productions of 1980 ,  but thumbs up for the two movies from 1978 . 
1	new york i love you is full of love and power .  not for everybody ,  however ,  but is a beautiful movie .   it has the likes of shia labeouf  ( seen in transformers ,  disturbia ,  charlies angels ,  i robot ,  indiana jones ,  and many more )  ,  maggie q ,  kevin bacon ,  blake lively ,  natalie portman ,  and many more .  with a star-studded cast ,  this movie is without a doubt ,  brilliant .   from many top-notch directors around the world ,  it does not fail to impress .  the diversity from one story to another is creative and unique .   it is safe to say that new york i love you is a popcorn movie ,  and should be watched on a big tv !  this time ,  trust the imdb rating ,  because it is an excellent film .   eagerly waiting shanghai i love you in 2010 .    watch ny ily ,  you won't be disappointed . 
1	mesmerizing ,  breathtaking and horrifying ,  this hauntingly beautiful film is the  " apocalypse now "  without fiction .  slow in pace ,  quiet in mood ,  it gives good glimpses of the poisoned patches of earth that may well be signs of an inevitable doom .   there is no doubt in my mind -- the nature is plagued and we are the disease .  greed ,  the very essence of humanity that drives evolution and progress ,  has turned us into something like cancer ,  on its way to consume the host and die with it .  .  .   manufactured landscapes is quite an unforgettable viewing experience - at least i'll never regard my toaster and iron the same way again . 
1	i enjoyed this movie as a kid when it came out ,  and to this day still do .  a simple story involving the search for a kidnapped girl and an adventurer literally straight out of paperback lore .  it has actors that were more recognizable back in the day .  this shouldn't keep the viewer from giving it a whirl .  wayne crawford stars as the main character jake speed .  sure ,  it might bite from certain elements of romancing the stone ,  and indiana jones .  but this movie is done well enough to keep it out of the cellar .  i am surprised not too many people know about it .  it must have been overshadowed by other movies in the theaters back in '86 .  i watched it back then on cable tv .  it might be hard to find since it's out of print on both vhs and dvd .  i managed to get a dvd from ebay at less than 8 bucks !  cool flick . 
0	watched this with my girlfriend after stumbling over it while zaping channels .   i guess we both hoped for some kind of happy family cute christmas movie ,  but were extremely disappointed .   the actor playing the soldier ,  seems to have 0 emotion whatsoever ,  his face looks the same ,  whether he's chopping down christmas tree's ,  seeing the girl he loves being kissed by her boyfriend ,  or when he's happily surprised by the girl he loves ,  he's an awful actor ,  and at no pont did any of us do nothing but laugh at him .   then there's the cute blond girl ,  blessed with the ability to count dot's and cheat on her boyfriend ,  what a catch !  and her ambition in life is to live with her parents and count more dots .   so it's basically a story about a guy without any emotion or feelings who falls for a guy who count dots and cheats on her boyfriend ,  it's as predictable as it get's ,  and really a waste of time ,  you gain nothing by watching this ,  other than some weird laughs ,  because it's all so corny .   i love it when her dad says that he only eats french fries and not french wine ,  and they all laugh ,  that's the hillbilly attitude this movie is about ,  furthermore ,  if my girlfriends dad were bossing me around like ,  i'd tell him a thing or to ,  but not our army veteran ,  no sir ,  he let's everyone boss him around .   the movie is what first blood would have been ,  if john rambo were burn like the biggest wimp in the world . 
0	i have two good things to say about this film :  the scenery is beautiful and peter falk gives a good performance  ( considering what he had to work with in terms of dialog and direction )  .  however ,  that said ,  i found this film extremely tiresome .  watching paint dry would have been more entertaining .  it seemed much longer than 97 minutes .  beginning with opening sequence ,  where everyone is talking over each other and paul reiser is repeating everything that's said to him on the phone ,  the movie is annoying .  the film is filled with clichés and shtick ,  not to mention endless incidents of audible flatulence by falk .  also ,  the director seems to have had difficulty deciding whether to aim for laughs or tears .  there are some sequences that are touching ,  but they're all played for laughs .  if schmaltzy ,  sentimental ,  and  " cute "  appeal to you ,  you'll love it .  but if you were hoping for something with more substance ,  see a different movie . 
1	i've had a lot of experience with women in russia ,  and this movie portrays what a lot of them are like ,  unfortunately .  they are very cunning ,  ruthless ,  and greedy ,  as well as highly unfair .  from the robotic sex ,  the hustling for gifts ,  to the lies and betrayal ,  i've experienced it all in russia .   i know what i'm talking about .  and here are my qualifications :  here are the photojournals of my three trips to russia in search of a bride .  it includes thousands of pics of many hot russian girls i met ,  black comedy ,  scams i was privy to ,  and the story of my mugging and appearance on russian national tv .   http : //www . happierabroad . com/photojournals . htm  it's like reality tv .  you will love it .  i spent a ton of time putting it together .  so check it out .  the russian woman that nicole kidman plays is a lot like the julia and katya in my photojournals .   my 3 bride seeking trips in russia happen to be very exciting and would sell ,  so why don't they make a movie out of my bride seeking adventures in russia ?  however ,  there is one factual impossibility in this film ,  and that is the way which the guy orders his bride from a catalog and having her arrive at an airport .  it doesn't work that way at all ,  so i don't understand why the media likes to perpetuate this .  there isn't a single russian bride introduction website that works this way ,  and i challenge anyone to find one that does .  the fact is ,  you can only order the russian lady's contact info  ( email ,  address ,  phone number ,  etc .  )  from the website .  from there ,  you correspond and then visit her ,  and if you want to bring her to your country ,  you start the immigration process at your ins office ,  and wait months after that .  that's how it works in real life .  you can't just order her to arrive at your airport .  us immigration would never allow such a thing to happen .   wumaster   - i got everything i wanted by going abroad !  you can too !  http : //www . happierabroad . com
0	i had absolutely nothing to do the past weekend ,  and tagged along with my friends to check out a movie .  .  . any movie .  and since the only movie we'd not seen was inspector gadget ,  we decided to go in for that .   big mistake .  this is a movie that might appeal only to kids .  oh ,  and it's not like i don't enjoy movies targeted at the younger audience .  but this movie had absolutely nothing to hold my attention .  if you have nothing to do at home ,  go to sleep .  better than wasting hard-earned cash on this .  go check out the film if you're a kid or if you're a parent with a kid  :  ) 
0	ah ,  bait .  how do i hate thee ?  let me count the ways .  1 .  you try to be funny ,  but are corny and unenjoyable ;  every joke is predictable and expected ,  and when it comes ,  does not inspire laughter .  instead ,  i want to hurl .  2 .  you try to be dramatic ,  but are unbelievable ;  the woman overacts to a terrible degree ,  and the  " bad guy "  looks like bill gates ,  and is about as scary as .  .  . well ,  bill gates .   ( just try to imagine bill gates trying to intimidate somebody with a gun .  doesn't work ,  does it ?  a lawyer ,  maybe ,  but not a gun .  doesn't fit .  )  as for jamie foxx ,  well ,  just watching him try to deliver a dramatic and heartfelt dialogue is ludicrous ,  and makes me want to hurl .  3 .  you try to be action-packed ,  but instead are dull and dragging too many times .  and when the action heats up ,  the tripod for the camera must have been lost ,  for the scenes wobble more than those in the blair witch project ,  and i find myself nauseated ,  and once again i want to hurl .  4 .  you try to be a good movie ,  but you failed ,  you failed ,  you failed !  i would rather walk barefoot across the sahara with a pack full of beef jerky and no water ,  no sunscreen ,  and only meryl streep for company .  this hell would be lovelier than a single minute more spent watching everyone in bait overact their way through an idiotically written story with bill gates for a bad guy ,  and let's not even talk about the massive bomb that goes off in a car that jamie foxx's character has just driven off a cliff ,  but somehow manages to escape .  .  . just kill me now ,  or do the right thing and promise me that somehow i'll never have to watch a movie that is this bad ,  ever again . 
1	this movie has great fight scenes .  now its true that the acting is a little rough .  but if i wanted to see a movie based on acting skills i would watch a cheesy movie like american beauty .  but if you want to see a movie with true martial arts in it and with amazing stunts without the use of wires and flying threw the air like so many movies around now which are over killing the matrix .  then watch this .  now it's true the two main stars in the show where in the kid show the power rangers and another cast member of that show has a bit part in this movie .  but hey the fight scenes are enough to make jet li p**s his pants .  and the stunts are worthy enough for jackie chan to sit threw and admire . 
0	the only film i've ever walked out on .  amazing ,  since i paid for myself and my date and i'm really cheap .  but my brain couldn't stand any more of the dreck being piled on ,  particularly since i could have written funnier material while tie up and gagged .   from the beginning to the end this film offends .  worse ,  it ain't funny .  it wasn't funny then ,  and it sure ain't funny now .  but even worse ,  is that this film represents the beginning of the end of really smart ,  sophisticated comedy .  it's juvenile ,  really sophomoric script and ideas began an era  ( which continues to this day )  where cheap laughs ,  and sexual innuendo dominate the culture of comedy in film .   sexual olympics ?  what high school kid hasn't thought of that ?  the beginning of the end . 
1	i remember watching this film on saturday afternoon tv in the 1950s or 60s .  it was well presented but i do remember there was a message of hope broadcast from transmitters secreted in lamposts in one of the last maniacal executions for impending liberation .  i'm not sure that squares with the facts .   still the film is well done .  the german high command reports wryly without emotion  " the russians are advancing down the fredrich strasse "  as if all went according to plan .   it was my impression that this film and a later american made for tv knock-off was based on the british historian trevor-roper's account by a similar title last days of hitler .  i was surprised to see no credit to trevor-roper .   i agree the newest german film on the subject downfall was as well done as the classic .  the american knock-off was a little flat .   few figures have attracted as much attention from the cinema as adolph .  yet i find it interesting that none of the many films and books that have come out ever speak of hitler's double alluded to in passing in john toland's magnificent historical piece .   was gibs ? 
0	if this film had a budget of 20 million i'd just like to know where the money went .  a monkey could make better cgi effects then what was wasted for 3 hours on this dreadful piece of garbage ,  although i must admit the machines and the martians would have looked really ,  really cool on an original play-station 1 game ,  and early pc games from the mid 90s if a game had ever been made .  what puzzles me is where did the money go ?  pendragon films could have made a great film with good old fashioned models and computer controlled cameras a la george lucas circa 1975-83 ,  and actors who actually look like they care about what they are doing  ( or ruining in this case )  for about the same 20 million .  this is quite possibly the worst film ever made !  i would rather sit through a 24 hour repeat screening of ishtar than watch this film again .  i hated it completely !  i regress .  i say this is the worst film ever made because unlike other bad movies like plan 9 or killer tomatoes ,  or santa claus conquers the martians ,  these are films that are so bad you have a special place in your heart for them ,  you love them .  there is no love for this film and no place in my dvd library for it .  i sold it to a guy for a dollar .  i'm betting the money for the film was spent on booze and other vices for the cast and crew .  shame on you pendragon films !  i want my money back ! 
0	if you want to learn the basics of quantum mechanics ,  spend your $9 on a used textbook ,  not this movie .  i'm a little worried that the money i spent is being used to buy kool-aid for shipment to guyana .    i don't think the directors really got any point across ,  but it looks like maybe they were trying to make several :  1 )  science can explain everything we do ,  meaning that our lives are deterministic ;  2 )  science can't be used to explain everything we do ,  meaning that we have free will ;  3 )  science is ,  like ,  really cool ,  brother ;  4 )  we are god ;  5 )  the world exists only in our minds ;  6 )  sarah norman is a tough role to follow and 7 )  here ,  put this tiny paper square in your mouth and you'll see some really groovy stuff . 
0	first off ,  the title character is not even the main character of the movie .  he is the sidekick of the cult leader .  the actor who portrays igor believed that screaming loud ,  laughing hysterically ,  and having a crooked smile while bugging out your eyes would be an excellent way to scare people .  igor also had the annoying habit of yelling  ( because he never actually just spoke )  in a high pitched voice .  he would also say idiotic one-liners .  for example when the cult leader murders one of his followers with a buzz saw ,  igor upon seeing this ,  yells out  " paul !  no paul !  why'd you do it ?  i could have cut her clean !  so clean !  "  in another scene igor tells a victim that she would have to 'get her own tools for surgery because right now ,  it was his time to operate . ' aside from the bad acting ,  the ending did not make sense because while the story builds up what little steam it has towards the climax ,  which is igor getting a crossbow arrow to the head and the rest of his lunatic buddies being killed ,  he shows up again two more times to kill the remaining 'good guys' .  the movie offers no explanation of this ,  only telling the viewer that igor escaped from the mental hospital .  what ?  ?  ?  bottom line is do not waste your time watching this movie .  i wish i could get back the moments i lost watching this . 
0	an allegation of aggravated sexual assault along with some other unpleasant peccadilloes ,  including improper use of a broom ,  are made against half a dozen or so of the most popular high-school jocks in glen ridge ,  new jersey ,  by a  " mildly retarded "  student  ( heather matarazzo )  .  the investigation and building of the case are handed over to the da's office ,  where ally sheedy and eric stoltz are put in charge .   rumors about the case spread through glen ridge ,  an upper-middle-class suburb where the jocks are adored by everyone in the community .   ( one of their fathers is a police lieutenant .  )  nobody believes matarazzo .   " our boys would never take a slut like that down to the basement ,  rape her ,  and subject her to such sexual humiliation .  "  the question is whether sheedy and stoltz will ever be able to shape a sufficiently cogent case that they can bring the jocks to trial .  matarazzo is not an ideal plaintiff .  she's desperate for love and friendship ,  and that makes it easy for faux friends to mislead her into making false statements .  a slimy reporter says ,   " you can trust me ,  "  but it turns out the reporter can't be trusted at all .  another student ,  a very popular girl in school ,  pulls a linda tripp on matarazzo ,  pretending to be her bosom buddy but all the while asking her leading questions about the incident -- and taping the results !  as a consequence ,  watching this story unfold is like being on a roller coaster .  at first it looks like a good case for sheedy and stoltz .  but then ,  oops ,  the community organizes against the law .  then it looks good again .  but then the reporter interferes .  then that obstacle is no sooner overcome ,  than linda tripp pokes her big nose into the investigation and makes public the tapes that seem to indicate matarazzo was lying .   ( well ,  actually ,  she was lying -- but she was lying to her interrogator in order to please her .  )  then that's overcome ,  but matarazzo objects to taking the stand because she doesn't want to be characterized as  " retarded .  "  eric stoltz is fine in the part of the prosecutor .  i say that for the simple reason that he and i lived in pago pago around the same time .   ( i hope he wasn't the kid i had that altercation with at the bar of the seaside club .  if he was ,  i take back my compliment .  )  ally sheedy is a strange actress and hard to characterize .  she did a marvelous self-restrained job in  " fine art "  but i didn't sense any particular effort being put into this role ,  which was rather formulaic anyway .  i mean ,  neither she nor stoltz nor anyone else could give a bravura performance in what's essentially a comic book story .   the producers and director had the good sense to choose heather matarazzo for the role of victim .  the very worst thing they could have done is cast an ethereally lovely ,  neotenous blond .  instead ,  matarazzo ,  without being at all ugly ,  looks rather plain and this ordinary quality is complemented by her grooming and make up .  nor have the writers turned her wistful and gentle .  she has a temper and is sometimes irritating to listen to ,  which is all for the good .   matarazzo's character is the best drawn in the film .  the jocks are stereotypes .  pure evil .  they think themselves above the law ,  barge in on some nice girl's party in east orange ,  trash the place during a party far worse than  " la dolce vita's "  climactic orgy ,  and leave without explanation or apology .  they deserve to get it in the neck -- and they do .   i referred to this as a comic book story and that's pretty much what it is .  it challenges none of our prejudices .  it reaffirms out belief that the world can be divided into good and evil .  and we don't have a moment's doubt about who's who .  what i'm waiting for -- not really ,  that's just rhetorical -- is a movie almost exactly like this one and a dozen others ,  but in which the victim is lying in order to get her name and photo in the papers and garner all those sympathy chips from right-thinking folk like the rest of us .   the film is based on a true story ,  as are so many others we've all seen ,  and even more fictional features .   ( eg .  ,   " the accused "  .  )  some are good ,  some are strictly routine .  okay .  fair enough .  now when do we get to see a film about the tawana brawley case ,  in which the teen-aged girl disappeared on a whim for a few days ,  then had her friends strip her ,  tie her up ,  and smear her with dirt ,  so she could claim she'd been abducted and raped by the police ?  now that would be a challenge in a way this one simply is not . 
0	when converting a book to film ,  it is generally a good idea to keep at least some of the author's intended tone or conveyed concepts ,  rather than ignoring the author altogether .  while it is clear that the director had access to and went on the advice of elinore stewart's children ,  it is key to note that the children believed their mother to be a complete liar in regards to the good ,  enriching ,  strengthening experiences of homesteading her land .  the book details her life on her and her husband's adjoining homesteads in the vast wyoming frontier ;  she chronicles daily adventures with her numerous friends and acquaintances ,  though they lived dozens of miles apart .  the film ,  however ,  takes a standard stance for the time it was made ,  portraying this woman's experience as harsh ,  unforgiving ,  and nearly pointless .  perhaps the director was bringing some of his vietnam war experiences with him to this movie  ( as some film aficionados have said )  ,  but it seems to be a lousy excuse for taking all the joy and beauty of the book and twisting it into a bleak ,  odious landscape devoid of friends or hope .  don't waste your time with this movie ;  read the book instead . 
0	reading my review of the house that screamed ,  many may assume that i'm some 14 year old who thinks scream is considered  " classic "  horror .  this is not the case ,  as i'm 30 years old and have been watching horror films for most of my life .  but admittedly ,  i'm a child of the 80's that grew up on slasher/zombie/ghost/cannibal ,  etc .  .  . types of horror films - so i do typically prefer horror films that are more graphic and faster-paced .  just like someone who can appreciate different music ,  painting ,  or in this case ,  film - but not necessarily like them - i can appreciate why some people may enjoy this sort of film .  .  . i just don't .  .  .   the house that screamed is an exceedingly dull and tedious film about a school for wayward girls .  the heavy-handed mistress of the school rules with an iron hand  ( or whip in some cases .  .  .  )  to keep the girls in line .  she has a young son who creeps around and peeps on the girls while they shower  ( in their nightgowns no less  (  ?  !  ?  )  .  .  .  )  ,  and meanwhile ,  girls are disappearing from the school as they are the victim of a murderer who's lurking about the campus .  .  .   i can see why the house that screamed is often compared to suspiria  ( which is a masterpiece of a film in my opinion .  .  .  )  ,  in terms of the atmosphere of the school itself and the interaction between the girls and their guardians - but this film is so dull and uneventful that i could barely stay awake .  i'm all for  " tension "  and  " suspense "  in horror films - but this film held neither for me .  luckily ,  i wasn't expecting a whole lot going into this one ,  so i can't say i was really disappointed - the house that screamed just reinforced the fact that i personally don't typically enjoy most horror films much older than from the 70's .  this isn't a hard and fast rule ,  but those that i have enjoyed definitely seem to be more of the exception .  probably a  " must-see "  for horror fans who enjoy more understated and suggestive horror films - but as i don't really know too many fans of that sort of material ,  i can't really recommend this one .  .  . 4/10
1	i've read the other reviews and found some to be comparison of movie v real life  ( eg what it takes to get into music school )  ,  britney bashing ,  etc ,  etc .  so let's focus on the movie and the message .   i have rated this movie 7 out of 10 for the age range 8 to 14 years ,  and for a family movie .  for the average adult male .  .  .  .  2 out of 10 .   i like pop/rock music ,  i'm 45 .  i know of britney spears but never realised she actually sang stronger until i read the credits and these reviews .  i didn't recognise her poster on the wall so i was not worried about any 'self promotion' .   i watch movies to be entertained .  i don't care about casting ,  lighting ,  producers ,  directors ,  etc .  what is the movie and does it entertain me .   i watched this movie for the message .  the world's greatest epidemic is low self-esteem  ( which is a whole other story )  so watched with the message in mind ,  as that is an area of interest .  the movie is light ,  bright and breezy ,  great for kids .  i found the texan twang began to fade throughout the movie and of course there are only so many ways to convey the give up/don't give up message ,  so yeh ,  it was a bit predictable .  great message though .  .  . should be more of them .   this movie is a great family movie ,  but for a bloke watching by himself ,  get hannibal . 
1	this film is a great example of fine storytelling .  the acting is superb .  the story is inspiring without being overly manipulative or fake .  there were a couple points where they probably made people a tad more good or bad than they really were ,  but considering it is a hollywood movie ,  they showed amazing restraint .  there wasn't a single explosion shown in the movie ,  even though they had one opportunity to .  the film ,  while having suspenseful parts ,  was not made into an action movie .  the story is thus made to focus on an extraordinary man in unfortunately ordinary times .  well done ! 
0	this might be unbelievable ,  but this movie has grossed $878 , 138 in russia !  it's shown in almost all cinema theaters and still running !  well ,  i have no idea why distributors put their eye on this particular uh  " movie "  ,  which had almost no screening around the world .  that's some kind of enigma !  haha !  maybe it was based on the fact that another movie ,   " pledge this "  with paris hilton ,  which was as well released only dvd almost everywhere ,  had major screenings in russia and grossed more than 1mln$ .  besides ,  both movies had a lot of promotion ,  like there were the banners all over the city ,  tv commercials and etc .  speaking about movie ,  i'd say it's dull and absolutely boring .  it could be better ,  really .  even if it has jessica simpson . 
0	given the history of the director of this movie ,  it is hard to believe that this was such a painfully bad movie to sit through .  i was at the european premiere last night and one of the executive producers was there .  he was yet to see the movie and ,  boy ,  was he in for a surprise .  i have not read the book that this is based upon ,  nor do i know if it highly rated or appreciated ,  but i have read  " captain correlli's mandolin "  and given how poorly that was adapted for screen and how bad this movie was ,  i can only presume that something similar has happened here .  the acting wasn't bad albeit that there were a couple-too-many raised eyebrows from farrell .  honestly ,  i can't believed how little i cared for any character in this movie .  situations play out on the screen in an empty sequence of nothingness .  donald sutherland's part comprises a few scenes where he opens a door ,  says something and closes it again .  i kept looking at my watch when i wasn't cringing at the dialogue on the screen .  i have never walked out on a movie but i was tempted to start during this .  i gave this movie a score of '2' for reasons which seem horrendously shallow to me but these are the best things that i can say about this movie .  the first is that i really enjoyed the all-too-short earthquake scene and the second is that salma hayek got naked and looked beautiful .  i can say little else positive about this movie .  don't ask the dust anything ,  it can't talk ! 
1	john waters has made the most effusively buoyant ,  heartfelt ,  dark ,  personal little film i think i've ever seen  ( well maybe fast food fast women comes in close second )  the directors vision is untainted .  .  . the narrative is whimsical ,  the characters are personal and odd reflections of family and his own inner life  .  .  . the tone never forced or stylistically over-arch .   there is no pretentious shot design ,  ennui ,  or magazine grading .  .  .  . martha plimpton is amazing as the sister .  . eddie furlong is inspired casting .  a grandmother with a talking mary ,  tea-bagging ,  recycled clothing ,  yesterday's garbage becomes today's art -- and the lesson of the film is that the most important thing we can value is family  .  .  .  and a humble life . 
0	ummm ,  please forgive me ,  but weren't more than half the characters missing ?  in the original novel ,  valjean is a man imprisoned for 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread and then attempting several times to escape .  he breaks parole and is pursued relentlessly by the police inspector javert .  along the way there are many characters that weren't in this version .  some worth mentioning would be fantine ,  cosette ,  m & mme .  thenardier ,  eponine ,  marius ,  gavroche ,  and enjolras .  the only character with the same name is javert .  i was confused and frustrated throughout the whole movie ,  trying to see how it was in any way connected to victor hugo's epic novel . 
1	few movies can be viewed almost 60 years later ,  yet remain as engrossing as this one .  technological advances have not dated this classic love story .  special effects used are remarkable for a 1946 movie .  the acting is superb .  david niven ,  kim hunter and especially roger livesey do an outstanding job .  the use of black and white / color adds to the creative nature of the movie .  it hasn't been seen on television for 20 years so few people are even aware of its existence .  it is my favorite movie of all time .  waiting and hoping for the dvd release of this movie for so many years is ,  in itself ,   " a matter of life and death "  . 
0	oh my god !  please ,  for the love of all that is holy ,  do not watch this movie !  it it 82 minutes of my life i will never get back .  sure ,  i could have stopped watching half way through .  but i thought it might get better .  it didn't .  anyone who actually enjoyed this movie is one seriously sick and twisted individual .  no wonder us australians/new zealanders have a terrible reputation when it comes to making movies .  everything about this movie is horrible ,  from the acting to the editing .  i don't even normally write reviews on here ,  but in this case i'll make an exception .  i only wish someone had of warned me before i hired this catastrophe
0	i just saw this movie ,  and i have to say that it was a big waste of time .  the girl who played eva  ( ellen fjaestad )  can't act at all .  she read her lines very un-naturally ,  and she had a very un-natural facial expression through the entire movie .  rosanna munter who played petra on the other hand ,  is a natural .  she played her part with great perfection .   spoilers !  the story was simple - we've seen it many ,  many times before .  she breaks up ,  he finds another ,  she get jealous ,  he breaks up with the other girl and they end up back together in the end .  there were no surprises at all ,  one knew that eva would break up ,  and that adam would  " hook up "  with petra .  the only thing that nobody saw coming was that petra told adam to go after eva at the party .  she became all serious ,  which is a side of petra the viewers hadn't seen earlier in the movie ,  and told him to win eva's heart back ,  which was really cute .   besides rosanna munter ,  there isn't a single actor who gives a memorable performance .   this is a mediocre movie with mediocre actors ,  so i don't recommend it ! 
0	after buying the dvd in a bargain bin due to the impressive amount of features listed on the cover ,  i popped it in the dvd player and everything looked good .  nice animated menus and a whole lot of extra features .  .  . but when i played the movie itself ,  what a let down .  it is the worst thing i have ever seen and i have seen some bad movies in my time .  the comment that praises the movie here at imdb is actually from the people who made the film .  so don't believe it unless you like to waste your cash ! 
0	i guess its possible that i've seen worse movies ,  but this one is a real stinker !  the plot is unremarkable but thats not the worst of it .  the directing is no where close to what you would expect from andy ching .  he's capable of good work but failed to pull this movie together .   angie harmon ,  playing the female lead as a reporter dogging into who's behind the assassination of the president ,  truly butchered the role .  there was no chemistry with gooding ,  her demeanor was flat and wooden ,  and the 5 inch spike heels she wore throughout the movie were absurd .  this outing for harmon places her solidly at the bottom of the  " b "  list .   and what was cuba gooding thinking ?  ?  ?  he has to his credit a number of outstanding performances ,  but this was far beneath what we've come to expect from him .   poor james woods and burt reynolds .  poor poor poor poor poor . 
0	ah ,  lucio fulci ,  rest in peace .  this infamous italian is most  famous for  " zombie ,  "  and the absolutely unwatchable  " the  psychic "  and  " manhattan baby .  "  well ,  add this to the unwatchable  list .   the plot ,  as it were ,  concerns a nekkid woman who wears a gold  mask and a g-string .  she wants the power of a young dubbed  stud who has a set of magic arrows and a bow .  they are magic  because they glow .  arrow boy teams up with a guy in a bad wig ,   and they spend most of the movie rescuing each other from flat  action sequences .  in the end ,  the nekkid chick is defeated ,  but not  before taking the mask off and reminding me why i broke up with  my high school girlfriend .   fulci bathes every shot in an orange glow and fills the screen with  smoke .  nothing like a smoky orange action sequence to make you  crave sunny delight and a cigarette .  the special effects are  laughable .  in one sequence ,  our ambiguously gay duo are  attacked by dozens of arrows that are obviously pin scratches on  the film itself .  the majority of the effects budget must have been  spent on the fulci-licious gore ,  which consists entirely of spurting  wounds .  hey ,  we can all use a good spurting wound once in a  while ,  but when you get into spurting wound overkill ,  it gets boring .   i kept having to play with the brightness setting on my tv anyway  just to see what the heck was happening .   there is lots of talk of fulfilling omens and prophecies ,  so let me  do a little look into the future .  .  . if you find this movie and watch it ,   you will regret it .  the scene on the video box  ( by media )  does not  appear in the film in any context whatsoever .   " conquest "  is a con  job .  what mst3k could have done with this !   this is rated  ( r )  for strong physical violence ,  strong gore ,  female  nudity ,  brief male nudity ,  and mild sexual content .   
0	after having seen the movie the first question arising in my mind was :  is this supposed to be irony or not ?  after reading a few comments about the character doc savage and the comic series ,  i knew this film was not meant to be ironic .  so ,  the story tells us about an us-american super-doc saving a south american republic from evil .  sounds like a typical story .  but this one comes in such an unrealistic way that it becomes ridiculous .  the mandatory end-fight shows the worst presentation of martial arts i have ever seen .  the film might be interesting for low budget movie designers as a bad example . 
0	it is enjoyable and fast-paced .    there is no way on earth that the actor playing mat could be eighteen .  however ,  the main thing is that he does act eighteen very convincingly .  it must be a credit to his audition that he convinced them to cast him .  i quite soon accepted him as being a naive young country boy .   while his was the best performance ,  most of the others were also very engaging .  in particular ,  the interplay between the policemen was natural and well-balanced ,  and worked very well .   it is only about 45 minutes long ,  so the plot is not complex .  more key is the style of the whole thing .  it is very slick and vibrant ,  and the backdrops are atmospheric ,  especially from the fact that all the colours are extremely rich .  the gangland is identifiable to foreign audiences ,  but still manages to be distinctly australian . 
0	i just watched this movie on starz .  let me go through a few things i thought could have been improved ;  the acting ,  writing ,  directing ,  special effects ,  camera crew ,  sound ,  and lighting .  it also seemed as though the writers had no idea anything that had to do with the movie .  apparently back in 2007 ,  when the dollar was stronger you could buy a super advanced stealth bomber that could go completely invisible for $75 million .  now-a-days those things cost about $3 billion and they cant go invisible .  apparently you can fly from the us to the middle east in an hour .  there was a completely random lesbian scene ,  which i didn't mind ,  but it seemed like a lame attempt to get more guys to see it .  the camera would randomly zoom in on actors and skip to random scenes .  oh yeah ,  since its a steven segal movie ,  its predictable as hell .  all in all i rank it right up there with snakes on a plane . 
0	the shame of it !  there i was ,  comfortable in the arm chair with a beer and a bag of popcorn ,  bouyant in the hope of another splendid muppet night of entertainment .  what did i get ?  disappointed !  how can the muppets go from the sublime christmas carol to this ?  the humour was dreadful ,  the songs were worse than country and western  ( and that's saying something )  and the plot was as confused and poor as blind pew .  i think the main problem was that they bit off too much in attempting treasure island .  a short tale ,  such as christmas carol ,  is perfect because you can weave the muppet high jinks around it .  .  .  . here the need to drag the plot along stopped all the fun .  where do the muppets go next ?  how about muppets wizard of oz ? 
1	this is a very moving picture about 3 forty-something best friends in a small england town .  one finds a passionate loves and a new beginning with a younger piano instructor ,  when tragedy strikes and hearts are changed forever .  definitely a film to have a box of tissues with you !  a powerful piece of work .  this is definitely one of my favorite films of all time .   *spoiler !  !  !  spoiler alert !  !  spoiler !  ! *  the main character is taken by her young ,  handsome piano instructor and a passionate romance blossoms .  her two jealous  " friends "  play an immature prank which quickly leads to tragedy .  she loses her love and her friends in one foul swoop .  in the end a unexpected surprise pulls them back together .  ( in my opinion her forgiveness is not warranted ) 
0	this movie sucked plain and simple .  okay so it's basically about a girl that gets raped ,  and to get revenge she gets another guy to rape the rapist .  the rapist is a douche ,  but the girl victim is partly to blame .  i mean they both get in the mood and start kissing and stuff ,  but when the rapist tries to have sex with her ,  she doesn't allow it so the rapist rapes her .  and the thing is the rape scene for the girl is very short and it doesn't really expose or show anything ,  but when it comes to the rapist getting raped ,  it's a pretty long rape scene .  there is basically nothing in the story that is worth watching .   3 . 2/10
1	frustrated middle-aged deputy district attorney george maxwell  ( a fine performance by george e .  carey ,  who also produced this picture )  can't stand his naggy ,  frigid wife edith  ( a perfectly bitchy anne bellamy )  anymore .  worse yet ,  poor george is further saddled with a newborn baby sun and a lascivious lesbian teenage daughter  ( dishy brunette sheri jackson )  .  george has an adulterous fling with lovely ,  enticing and free-spirited swinging hippie babysitter candy wilson  ( delightfully played with sexy aplomb by yummy blonde knockout patricia wymer )  .  complications ensue when george finds himself being blackmailed by the bitter julia freeman  ( a nicely venomous turn by kathy williams )  ,  who wants george to spring her psychotic biker boyfriend laurence mackey  ( a frightening robert tessier ,  who sports a head full of hair here )  from jail .  director tom laughlin  ( yep ,  the same dude who portrayed billy jack !  )  and screenwriter james mclarty cram the splendidly seamy story with a winning and highly entertaining surplus of delicious female nudity ,  sizzling soft-core sex ,  and raw violence .  moreover ,  they accurately peg the whole wild'n'easy uninhibited sensibility of the 60's youth culture and relate the plot in a tight 75 minute running time ,  thus ensuring that this movie doesn't overstay its welcome .  one definite highlight occurs when candy invites her groovy friends over the maxwells house for an impromptu basement bash complete with pot smoking ,  wailing rock music ,  and ,  of course ,  hot naked dancing chicks .  robert o .  ragland's funky score hits the gnarly spot .  stanton fox's stark black and white cinematography adds an extra gritty edge to the deliriously sleazy goings-on .  best of all ,  this flick rates as a marvelous showcase for the utterly charming and fresh-faced pixie patricia wymer ,  who positively lights up the screen with her sweet ,  bubbly personality and captivating beauty .  a total trashy treat . 
1	on paper this looked like a great concept :  average guy on the rebound dates up tight bookish museum curator ,  who is really a hot superhero who saves the world on a regular basis .  however ,  director ivan reitman and writer don payne  ( of the  " simpson's "  )  almost fatally miscalculate in having their hero g-girl  ( played by striking uma thurman )  come off as a total nut job as both superhero and secret identity persona jenny johnson .  the movie even cops to this in a conversation between jenny and matt saunders  ( luke wilson )  following his rescue by g-girl from the statue of liberty .  jenny curiously asks matt what was g-girl like .  matt replies ,   " she's kind of nutty "  i think the intent was to have jenny  ( thurman )  be this lonely young woman ,  who has no one in her life ,  isolated by her great physical powers .  thurman does the best she can ,  but her jenny is a terrifying mood swing in dire need of prozac .  luke wilson is way too breezy in the role reversal of boyfriend and superhero girl friend .    " my super ex-girlfriend "  is also a victim of bad timing ,  coming on the tail end of  " superman returns "  which plays superhero straight up ,  so to speak .  with all its quirks and inconsistent writing i still thought  " my super ex-girlfriend "  was funny and enjoyed the movie .  given that this is an ivan reitman movie ,  this could have been a lot better .  reitman starts with a great premise ,  and really squanders it .  first off ,  we all love the hero .  here neither jenny nor g-girl is really all that likable .  this is surprising for uma thurman ,  who is normally a charismatic and powerful presence .  in the beginning her jenny/ g-girl is just plain weird .  shocking .  because if there is a woman who can play a superhero ,  she is thurmanshe looks great .  only toward the end does her jenny become more sympathetic ,  instead of caricature .  although  " my super ex "  is not a straight superhero story ,  rather a romantic comedy of sorts ,  it does not provide what every superhero mythology requiresa great super villain .  here we have professor bedlam aka barry  ( eddie izzard )  who really is evil lite .  he is no lex luthor .  no plans for global domination .  bedlam rather barry does hold a grudge against g-girl ,  and expectedly it has to do with their shared past .  what is bizarre you don't know who you would rather spend time withbedlam or g-girl ?  luke wilson's matt is just  " some dude "  who happens to hook up with the psycho superhero .  one of the annoying things he does is that he confides in his repugnant loser friend vaughn  ( rainn wilson doing a bad whacked out impersonation )  .  wilson sometimes plays it a little too dense ,  and this dilutes his likable charm .  this does however work ,  in the comic sex scene with jenny .  matt while dating jenny/ g-girl realizes that he is in love with his co-worker hannah  ( perky anna faris )  .  so how does matt break up with g-girl ?  well ,  it's not pretty and for the most part hilarious .   dramatic superhero movies work .  romantic comedies with chemistry work .  what may be inherently difficult are superhero satires disguised as romantic comedies .  everyone loves the hero .  however ,  hero nut job ?  maybe not .  with all uma thurman's talent she is unable to accomplish this convincingly .  and she does not get sufficient support from reitman and payne .  thurman and wilson have enough charm and presence to survive their narrative failings .   " my super ex-girlfriend "  is fun and funny .  though given all involved ,  the movie could have been super . 
0	this is one of those movies that should have been way better than it turned out to be .  i dread to think what the blockbuster-approved edit must have looked like ,  because the director's cut on dvd was a bore of the epic proportions .  naturally ,  you don't expect it to be  " the godfather "  ,  but an acting class or two might have come in handy .   also ,  there were so many cute guys in this movie ,  but they were woefully under-exploited .  i like watching a bevy of hotties writhe around in their bvds as much as the next guy ,  but even i have a right to expect a little more .  it wasn't a total loss ,  though ;  at least we got a peek a drew fuller's  ( covered )  junk and truly upsetting haircut .  and there's huntley ritter looking even cuter than he did in  " bring it on "   ( and acting about as well )  .  there's always a silver lining ,  kids .  you just have to look really hard for it .  and occasionally ,  you have to make use of your pause button . 
0	this film has its good points :  hot chicks people die  the problem .  .  .  the hot chicks barley get nude and you don't get to see many of the people dieing ,  mostly just lots of fast movements and screaming though there were two good kill scenes .   also for those of you watching this for jenna jameson she is just a side chearator with a very small role and minor nude scenes .   what this film needed .  .  script and story would be nice but i will not complain about that .  .  simply put it needs more nudity and better kill scenes cuz lets face it that is why we watch these flicks .  .  .   i wouldn't waste my money on it .  .  . and if you must ,  wait until it's on the old shelves at your local video store
0	if you like the standard sly flicks that involve over the top action ,  unbelievable stunts  ( unbelievable is not intended to be complimentary here )  ,  and retarded dialogue ;  you will love this steaming pile of mountain goat dung .  i had high hopes based on the trailer .  i thought that stalone was going to be forced in his  " has-been "  days to yield to smarter people and make an action film that would place a credible hero in a credible situation where the story ,  setting ,  and  ( believable )  action would prevail .  i crave action that is at least close enough to reality that you can imagine the fear and excitement that would come from such an event .  my limited knowledge of hypothermia and its effects rendered at least one scene laughably ridiculous .  judge dredd is only better because you know going into the theater that you are going to see a comic book made into a movie .  the character ,  setting and everything else are beyond comparison to anything we might encounter ourselves .  cliffhanger on the other hand turns a mountain climbing guide into rambo before you can say  " yo ,  adrian !  " 
1	lost ,  probably the best t . v series ever made .  the storyline is clever and when all your questions are answered watching one episode ,  100 more are raised .  if lost can carry on it's magnificent ways and not get too carried away then it will be stapled the best show ever .  the survivors of a plane crash are forced to live with each other on a remote island ,  a dangerous new world that poses unique threats of its own .  after reading this your thinking how on earth can that be interesting ?  and heres your answer ,  every season so far has always been full of surprises ,  your always questioning your self why did that just happened and what's gonna happen next each time ,  very unexpected thing's happen and the story goes on wonderfully so far !  the series just sucks you in ,  it's chilling and very addictive ,  everything from the wonderful creators and directing to the magnificent performances by the cast creates a very believable story .  lost is simply unbelievable ,  amazing ,  highly entertaining ,  top notch ,  t . v at it's best . how ever you want to put it .    lost beat's all other show's by a landslide .  and if your hating or criticising lost you don't know how to watch t . v or watch drama .  lost simply doesn't disappoint ,  you would think a series carrying on for so long can't keep getting better .  but it does !  it just keep's on flowing it's unlike anything you would ever think off .   " every thing happens for a reason .  "  and that is truly shown in the series .  eventually you will reach a point were all the clues and everything that's happened or being done adds up .  you will feel and realise how the characters have changed and how and why everything is going on .    the 10 minutes of excitement :  you see something you didn't see coming ,  something major has happened to character or on the island .  there's hope somewhere .  you see a major twist that can or will change everything .  you hear your thought's churn ,  you wonder what's gonna happen next .  your heart beating .  the 30 minutes of brilliance :  you see a flawless scenes ,  tension building ,  you hear wonderful music by michael giacchino .  you see great flash backs ,  impressive acting .  you see wittiness ,  chilling atmosphere ,  which then get's converted back into tension .   everyone has there show that they are addicted too ,  that they can't get enough of ,  that they admire every minute and can't wait for the next episode ,  that they talk about 24/7 .  too me and many others it's this series .  lost .  once you start watching ,  you won't get enough .  the creators did a flawless job .  lost is completely unique and original ,  you won't see anything like it .  the clever idea of  " flashbacks and flashforwards "  and something major and different in every season sucks your thoughts .  would they ever make a series like  " lost "  ?  something so interesting and something you will always remember .  it simply has stunned the world when it hit t . v .  a new generation of dramatic/sci-fi .  a instant classic before it reached out to the viewers .   i'm sure you all heard of lost and it's 5 star reviews ,  and your annoying friend that won't stop telling you about it ,  so what's stopping you from watching ?   every episode leads to something new and it just doesn't stop getting better and better ,  you get more interested as it goes along ,  you learn things that are on the island that you wouldn't even think off .  the characters start to become very likable ,  and if your the critic type you would love to see lost in further detail ,  things like how the relationship between characters develop and how they learn the ways to under look and take on challenges from the island .  all together it's a great drama and a flawless series .  i guess we just all hope that lost will not have a downfall in the episodes to come and go to far .  .  .  .  . so if you don't watch lost ,  read the comment from the top again and you should change your mind .  seeing is believing ,  so until you start watching you will never know  . i strongly recommend this masterpiece of series :  lost !  !  start watching !  !  !  you have not seen nothing until you watch lost !  !  ! 
0	considering its popularity ,  i found this movie a huge disappointment .  maybe i was expecting too much from this film .  after all ,  it is one of the most well known martial arts films of the 1970s ,  but i could never figure out why .  the story is uninteresting .  it is also a very talky movie with sporadic action sequences .  my biggest problem with the movie was that the story does not offer a character that i could root for ,  since the intended hero is an idiot .  director chang has no sense of style ,  and he is unable to hide the glaring imperfections found in the narrative .  i know this is not supposed to be high art ,  but i found the movie boring .  definitely not the best example of this much-beloved genre .  its cult status escapes me .  i recommend you to skip it . 
1	i have no idea why this flick is getting such a bad rap by so many imdb users  ( some are saying it's his 'worst movie ever . ' what ?  ?  haven't any of you seen cradle 2 the grave ?  )  my favorite criticism is that the plot is totally stupid ,  and just an excuse to hang all of the action sequences on .  duh !  what the crap were you expecting from a jet li movie ?  did you honestly believe that someone thought up the story ,  then just loaded it up with action ?  of course not !  black mask is awesome ,  wall-to-wall action throughout nearly it's entire running time .  it's also deliciously gruesome ,  and we get plenty of severed limbs ,  decapitations ,  and creative ways of watching the bad guys  ( and quite a few innocent people ,  too !  )  get slaughtered .  most of li's other martial arts films are nursery-school when compared to black mask ;  there is no holding back on the gratuitous violence ,  bloodshed ,  or action sequences whatsoever !  and that made me a happy camper .  again :  if you go into a jet li movie expecting magnificent dialog and an intriguing plot ,  you are going for the wrong reasons .  black mask is probably my favorite of his movies  ( though ,  beware of the horrendous dubbing )  . 
0	really ,  i can't believe that i spent $5 on this movie .  i am a huge zombie fanatic and thought the movie couldn't be that bad .  it had zombies in it right ?  was i wrong !  to be honest the movie had it's moments .  .  . i thought it was cool when the guy got his head ripped off but that was about it .  overall i think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again .  the movie could have been better if we could see some boob but i had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that .  buyer beware .  .  . unless you are into masochism . 
0	i really wanted to love this show .  i truly ,  honestly did .   for the first time ,  gay viewers get their own version of the  " the bachelor "  .  with the help of his obligatory  " hag "  andra ,  james ,  a good looking ,  well-to-do thirty-something has the chance of love with 15 suitors  ( or  " mates "  as they are referred to in the show )  .  the only problem is half of them are straight and james doesn't know this .  if james picks a gay one ,  they get a trip to new zealand ,  and if he picks a straight one ,  straight guy gets $25 , 000 .  how can this not be fun ?  !  take my hand ,  lets stroll :    the most glaring problem with this show is the bachelor himself .  james is your typical young and successful gay guy with a nice smile and body ,  the one you'd probably give two glances towards at your local bar before grazing for greener pastures .  why they chose to cast james as the leading man is beyond me .  god knows there's so many other hotter and vivacious homosexual men out there dying to be on tv .   aside from his rather average physical appearance ,  james is about as interesting and exciting as a piece of chalk .  even as such ,  he has this arrogant ,  smugly condescending aura about him .  however ,  if james were standing up against a blank ,  white wall he'd meld right into in it .  i honestly can't recall a single interesting or noteworthy thing james said during the course of the show .  he is that boring and forgettable .  in fact ,  one of the mates flat out advised him he wasn't feeling a connection .  i thought that was the best part of the show .  also ,  james speaks with an excruciatingly annoying lilt .  sound feminine or sound masculine ,  but don't ****ing segue tones in the middle of sentences .  .  . so painful to sit through .  i hated him so much all throughout the show i kept thinking ,   " please choose a straight guy and humiliate yourself and your unfortunate looking hag "   then we have the suitors .  a remarkably bland bunch of men who don't seem to care either way what is happening .  equally vapid ,  they seem to be indistinguishable from one guy to the next except ,   " hey that guy has blond highlights or oh that one has curly hair "  again ,  astoundingly inept casting decisions seem to be the aim of this show .  while it may be hackneyed to type cast roles ,  it would've been a lot more entertaining to watch than these amorphous drones .  however ,  in all their banality they still manage to upstage james  ( which isn't all that hard to do anyway )  ,  slightly that is .  you know you have a problem when some of the suitors are actually hotter and more interesting than the leading man .  and the fact that the suitors seem to have more fun around each other than with the leading man ?  very sad .   also ,  i just thought that id point something mentioned on the message boards which i felt was actually true :  the straight men are all hotter than the gay guys .    don't get me wrong ,  im not saying all the gay guys were ugly and boring ,  as a matter of fact i found some of them very cute .  it's just that overall they were just blah compared to the men you'd see on shows like a shot at love with tila tequila or the bachelorette .   i don't know how many times i hit fast forward during this show .  i can accept a lead character as interesting as a cardboard box ,  i can accept the mundane ,  apathetic suitors but please for the love of god entertain me just a little .  no such luck .   if you're expecting drama ,  intrigue ,  sexiness ,  or excitement you will be severely disappointed .  the biggest  " drama "  comes from the fact that one of the suitors still may have a boyfriend in new york  ( how scandalous !  )  .  as titillating as that may be i guarantee you ,  that is the only thing that remotely resembles any conflict on this show .   sure there is the twist ,  but if you have any semblance of gaydar in you ,  you'll easily discern who's who  ( it wasn't hard at all ,  i was only wrong once .  )  this show is stacking so much of its chips on the twist that it fails to deliver anywhere else .   we get to watch as james & co plod along such exciting activities such as learning how to western step dance ,  shopping for gifts ,  visiting a petting zoo ,  and gay karaoke .  yawn .  sure you have the occasional topless dancing but who cares when everyone is boring anyway .  that's one of main problems with the show :  no one seems to be enjoying themselves--they are there just going through the motion trying mightily hard to appear to have a good time .  and you really cant blame them since the events are all wildly unimaginative and lame .   finally ,  the physical aspect is not there .  there's no cuddling ,  no caressing ,  no kissing  (  !  )  ,  no endearment of any sort .  it's just  " ok that was a boring date ,  im gonna go back to my ugly ,  tacky wanna-be sydney operahouse dwelling  ( quick peck on the lips )  cya .  "  this show is so ****ing prudish it's ridiculous .  i can understand them not wanting to play up the perceived indiscretionary nature of homosexual men ,  but come the **** on .  people who watch reality tv shows are gonna want more than standoffish hugs and curt kisses .  this show refuses to compromise .   sorry if this was long winded but i felt these were issues that needed to be addressed .  i do commend bravo for first putting up a show of this nature ,  but the staggeringly incompetent manner in which this show was handled is mind boggling .  to summarize my three points :  boring + boring + boring = go do something else .  you'll have more fun waiting at a doctor's office for an appointment ,  at least they have interesting magazines there . 
1	'holes' was a great movie .  disney made the right choice .  every person who i have talked to about it said they loved it .  everyone casted was fit for the part they had ,  and shia labeouf really has a future with acting .  sigourney weaver was perfect for the warden ,  she was exactly how i imagined her .  everyone who hasn't seen it i recommend it and i guarantee you will 'dig it' . 
0	i came here for a review last night before deciding which tv movie to settle in front of ,  and those i found made this one look unmissable .  how misled i feel !   firstly ,  it needs to be pointed out up front that this is very much a housewife's daytime movie .  the performances are wooden ,  every sentence is an attempt at 'poignant' in the way that housewife's daytime movies and bad soap operas always are ,  and it is based in that predictable and well-trodden premise that men  ( particularly soldiers )  are essentially violent and incompassionate .  the whole movie is about the 'drama' apparent in the moments when the male characters threaten to develop a second dimension .   if that sounds tolerable  ( or even enjoyable )  to you ,  then be warned .  linda hamilton's german accent ,  while quite good ,  is painfully distracting - as is her face ,  for some reason .  the other performances are no doubt an enduring source of embarrassment to their perpetrators ,  with painfully thin and obvious characterizations being the order of the day .  there are few surprises ,  but do watch for the 'monty pythonesque' endless supply of food and drink that miraculously appears from the hungry soldiers' knapsacks !   i wasn't expecting action ,  but i had hoped for beautiful or textural or emotionally charged .  what i got was a particularly bad christmas 'feelgood' story that will have an intelligent audience cringing with the crapulence of it all .   watch it under the folowing circumstances :  1 :  there's nothing else on .  2 :  you are a fan of predictable 'housewife takes on men and wins' tv movies .  3 :  the only way you can appreciate a true story is when hollywood turns it into a feature film .  4 :  you've imbibed enough nog that your emotions are easily stirred by unsophisticated storytelling . 
0	if this series supposed to be an improvement over batman - the animated series ,  i ,  for one ,  think it failed terribly .  the character drawing is lousy .  .  .   ( catwoman ,  for instance ,  looks awful .  .  .  )  but what really annoyed me is that it made batman look like a sort of wimp who just can't take care of himself in a battle ,  without the help of two ,  even three sidekicks .  i mean ,  he's batman ,  for god's sake !  i know the comic books ,  i know that nightwing and batgirl are supposed to be batman's allies ,  besides robin ,  but still .  .  .  making batman say that he needs help from them .  .  .  what ,  he can't handle a few punches ?  in btas ,  he could face a dozen adversaries without any problem .  .  .  he's getting old ?  come on .  .  .   and another thing :  i really don't think that batman would allow a kid like tim drake to go into battle that soon ,  without years of hard training .  one ,  it's irresponsible  ( and batman is everything ,  but irresponsible )  ,  and two ,  it's not what happened in the comics ,  if we are to remain faithful to them .   batman - the animated series made history ,  with its animation ,  its stories and its characters .  .  .  that really was a legend of batman .  the new adventures series turned the legend into just another batman flick . 
1	as i am always looking for something new and unique ,  i watched this film online .  i thought that it would be just another  " b "  rate movie but i was amazed at the acting by the two main characters .  all of the actors in this film were very capable and well directed .  the plot was wonderful and unique as well with an excellent moral to the story .   this movie is definitely not for someone looking for a sex romp ,   " dumb and dumber "  or blood and guts .  this is a wonderfully poignant film showing some grim realities of life coupled with the kindness of the human heart and just enough frivolity to keep it interesting .   i would prefer this movie to many  " a "  rate movies i have seen even a great number with high box office earnings .   i highly recommend this movie . 
1	what a pleasant surprise :  a disney dtv  ( direct to video )  sequel that's actually good .   " the lion king 1 1/2 "  is a comedy affair that involves everyone's favorite meerkat and warthog ,  timon and pumbaa .  it starts out with them watching the original movie and making comments ,  until timon complains that  " we're not here yet "  .  after fighting over the remote ,  timon and pumbaa decide to tell the audience  " their story "  .  they start the new movie ,  and the laughs begin .   to be honest ,  i was losing hope in disney .  most of their direct-to-video fare has been aggressively awful ,  with the story lines desperate to cash in on the original .   " 1 1/2 "  decides to try something different :  it tells the original story from a new point of view .  okay ,  it adds some stuff ,  like where timon came from and how he and pumbaa met ,  but it's an interesting concept .  nathan lane and ernie sabella perfectly recapture the bond and friendship that made us love them in the first movie .  there's also some neat movie parodies  ( including one scene that simultaneously spoofs 'the good ,  the bad ,  and the ugly' and 'cool hand luke )  ,  and the script is filled with funny memorable lines .   added to the cast are julie kavner  (  " the simpsons "  )  as timon's worry-wart mom ,  and jerry stiller as timon's slightly crazy uncle max .  matthew broderick shows up as simba ,  and his  " teen "  scene reminded me of ferris bueller .  everyone does well ,  especially robert guillame  ( is that how you spell it ?  )  as rafiki ,  who exudes more and more yoda-speak in this movie  ( timon comments on this several times )  .   'the lion king 1 1/2' is a perfect alternate choice for those of you getting tired of the shrekification of animation .  10/10
0	the prerequisite for making such a film is a complete ignorance of nietzche's work and personality ,  psychoanalytical techniques and vienna's history .  take a well-know genius you have not read ,  describe him as demented ,  include crazy physicians to cure him ,  a couple of somewhat good looking women ,  have his role played by an actor with an enormous mustache ,  have every character speak with the strongest accent ,  show ridiculous dreams ,  include another prestigious figure who has nothing to do with the first one  ( freud )  ,  mention a few words used in the genius' works ,  overdo everything you can ,  particularly music ,  and you are done .  audience ,  please stay away . 
1	most people who chase after movies featuring audrey tautou seem to not understand that amelie was a character - it is not really audrey tautou's real life personality ,  hence ,  every movie she partakes in is not going to be amelie part 2 ,  part 3 ,  etc .   now with that said ,  i too picked up this movie simply because audrey was in it .  yes ,  it's true ,  there is a big gap after the first scene where she isn't seen at all for maybe 45 min ,  but i didn't even miss her because i was having so much fun with the other characters .  the guy who lies about everything is too funny ,  the guy who justifies people who run out of his cafe and skip out on the bill by finding coupons and such which balance out the loss ,  actually .  .  .  .  getting into all the characters here could take quite a while ,  but this is one of the best movies i've seen in a while .   audrey tautou's character irene is not the overdone sugary girl that amelie was .  in fact ,  as irene ,  her rudeness to a bum asking for change caught me off guard at first .  in this film ,  irene is a girl with good intentions ,  but over the course of a  ( very awful )  day ,  her disposition becomes more and more sour and pessimistic .   what makes this film completely great is you have all these really interesting stories and plots building .  .  .  very entertaining to watch ,  great scenery and shots ,  very colorful and never too slow ,  and all of the characters can actually act .  the best part of the movie comes with about 20 minutes left .  .  .  .  this is when all of the plots start to mesh together and the ride really picks up and everything ties together and makes sense ,  and the whole butterfly effect blossoms .  i swear ,  it was the best 20 minutes of film i've seen in quite a while ,  and the ending .  .  .  .  it made me think  " damn i really lucked out finding this movie "  .  the ending to this movie is top notch .  whoever wrote the script for this is brilliant ,  because not only are there all these other subplots going on ,  but to somehow make them all tie in together  ( and in a sensible manner ,  which is the case here )  but also to make each character feel human and come alive ,  not just some stale persona used as a crutch to build up this whole butterfly effect .  .  .  very impressive .   i highly suggest this movie as it's a great film to watch anytime ,  in any mood ,  with any company or alone . 
0	 " true "  story of a late monster that appears when an american industrial plant begins polluting the waters .  amusing ,  though not really good ,  monster film has lots of people trying to get the monster and find out whats going on but not in a completely involving way .  give it points for giving us a giant monster that they clearly built to scale for some scenes but take some away in that it looks like a non threatening puppy .  an amusing exploitation film thats enjoyably silly in the right frame of mind .   ( my one complaint is that the print used on the elvira release is so poor that it looks like a well worn video tape copy that was past its prime 20 years ago .  ) 
1	i don't know why people except a lot from low budget indie films but i enjoyed this one as i'm a fan of urban horror .  there's not too many urban horror movies out there so when i saw this one on the shelf ,  just the title alone peaked my curiosity .  so i decided to check it out and i was surprised .  .  . it's not too often you run into a low budget indie horror film with great acting and a good story .  is it low budget ?  yes .  can you tell that it's low budget ?  yes .  .  . but once you start watching the movie you become so wrapped up in the story that it doesn't matter .  i like hip hop music too and the soundtrack is nice !  i don't know what's up with all these bad reviews for this film .  all i hear is  " worst movie ever "  .  have these idiots seen every movie out there ?  there's thousands of movies out there ,  how can you categorize one as the  " worst "  ever ?  a video not  " movie "  like  " zombiez "  may be the worst film i ever seen but i can't say that it's the worst movie ever since i haven't seen every movie out there .  bottom line these people who gave this movie bad reviews are probably from the suburbs .  listen ,  if you don't like minority based ,  urban films ,  the ghetto films ,  hip hop , etc then why watch these types of movies ?  ?  ?  !  !  !  knowing that you don't like this type of stuff ?  sure ,  this is a horror film but it's not just a horror film but it's an urban horror film with a multi-cultural based cast .  i don't like tv shows like dawson's creek or the o . c .  ,  they suck to me .  films like  " garden state "  ,   " wedding crashers "  and  " i heart huckabees "  suck to me .  i'm a guy from new jersey and these shows and movies suck to me .  why ?  because i can't relate to them .  they don't peak my interest .  just common sense .  believe me ,  i will never watch garden state 2 :  garden salad ,  wedding crashers 2 :  here's a sequel to torture you again since the first sucked so bad and i heart huckaboring .  now back to this movie ,  in regards to saint405's comment above ,  i don't know if this guy was smoking crack or got knocked  " stupid "  by his drunken dad before he watched the movie but to me ,  everyone did a great job .  the actor who played ricky  ( i forgot his name )  did a very good job .  i'm an aspiring actor myself taking theater at my school and i had to do a play where i had to cry and it's not easy to be emotional in a scene so i give props to actors who have to do an emotional scene and can pull it off .  anywho ,  i liked this movie and never heard of these actors and directors before but you bet i'll be looking out for their stuff for now on and if they are reading this ,  bring on the sequel !  !  !  i'm out .  jerzee representin' ! 
1	this is a great product . very quick to heat and i enjoy the dettachable base feature . the cons include a limited amount to pour water into the unit ( the lid does n't pop up very far ) and some of the finish does n't do great with steam . overall a good buy
1	i like this pan because of the tapered shape . it cooks sauces without boiling over because it is tall , and it sits perfectly on the small burner with no overlap for even heating . the handles stay cool , and the clean up is easy . beautiful exterior also . like all all clad products , this pan is worth the money . long lasting and well designed . the only thing i wish all clad would add is hash marks on the interior so i could see when i have reduced a sauce to half .
0	i have four 16-piece sets that i received for my wedding . they are beautiful plates , but they have a tendency to split in half with normal use - like heating food up in the microwave , going through the dishwasher or serving hot food . within 3 months , several plates cracked down the middle , making them unusable . a large serving bowl also split in half when hot food was added . i did a search on www.epinions.com and found i was n't the only person having these problems . everyone is having these problems . plus , it is impossible to find individual replacement pieces . you have to buy another set . what a racket . the clincher is that they are located in indonesia , so customer service and responsiveness is nonexistent . i 've gotten nothing but the international run-around
0	yes , it is pretty . no , it is not a good teapot . i have made tea for over 40 years , in all sorts of pots , and this is right up there with the worst . it drips a lot ! perhaps those who think it does not drip were just looking at the spout . and no , it does not drip from the spout . rather , lots of tea runs down the underside of the spout and ends in a big puddle under the pot . this happens with both fast and slow pouring , with full and near empty pots . this teapot will most likely have to become a pretty red flowerpot . just too much mopping up
0	i have to agree with the review about overflowing and basket popping ... .while this coffee maker does make excellent coffee , if you put a grain too much of ground coffee in it , it will overflow ... .very frustrating as we like strong coffee . because ours has overflowed so many times , the metal plate on the bottom has corroded and now it wo n't hold water ... .i 'll never buy this frogware again
1	i 'm glad we went back to braun for a coffee maker . tried a few others but they were n't as good . braun makes a hot , good cup of java , faster than most . i do wish they would go back to the 12 cup pot
0	the written description of this heater led me to believe that it would perform like the 2 5-yr-old vornado models that are the best electric heaters i 've ever had . the vh2 has major flaws . it 's single fan speed is way too fast , causing heated air to be cool/cold within 10 ft of the heater . the fan can not be slowed down . the thermostat causes the fan to stop and start in ridiculously short intervals ; thereby wasting energy i believe . finally , the thermostat is set so that when at the highest ( hottest ) setting it does n't allow the heater to bring even the immediate area around it to more than 70 degrees f. i 've had the heater 1 mo and will attempt to return it for a full refund in another wk or 2 as soon as i have an alternative brand in my home
0	i was so excited to get this set in the mail for my son , but when i took it out of the package it felt like sandpaper . i have washed it several times but it is still very rough . also the first time i washed it one seam ripped all the way down the side and frayed . it was very cheaply made , but my son does love it , purely because its thomas i 'm sure . i would n't buy this again
0	saw these canisters and fell in love with them . could n't wait to get them and when i did they were broken into a million pieces . they replaced them very timely but one lid is almost too small and the seal does n't fit properly . another lid fits so tight it takes two hands to get the lid off . i was disppointed in the quality . i would n't buy these again even if i had to buy something more expensive
1	this was my third foil cutter in one month . the other two were flimsy but cost about the same . they each broke in about two weeks . i have had this one for five months and it is n't broken yet
1	admittedly , i am a bit of a knife-buying nut . i love kitchen knives and own chef 's knives and santuko knives from wusthof , henckels , kyocera and furi . this calphalon katana 6-inch chef 's knife is incredibly sharp and it feels really good in the hand balance-wise . i like the way the handle is shaped , it is very comfortable and the bolster is ingenious . i love the way it looks too ! for the price , i 'd say you ca n't go wrong . i really like it a lot ! i have only had it for a few weeks though , but it seems to be of very good quality and hopefully we 'll see how well it resharpens when the need arises .
1	i thought i would by this product just to try with my senseo machine and some coffee i brought from europe . it works ! i also use it with my tea pods and got a great cup of tea . i will buy more
1	i used this pan just this morning and i really like it . it has a great non-stick surface and is easy to clean . the price is great also . the only thing that might be a problem for some people is the handle . it slants downward instead of upward . so , if you have a flat surface stovetop , your pan wo n't sit flat on the surface . i have a gas stove and it is not a problem for me . i did n't notice this from the picture and the descriptions do n't mention this but i think it is important to know . who knows , maybe i got a defective pan and do n't know it . other than that , it is a great pan for the money . i like it more than other non-stick pans i have had .
0	i almost threw this coffee maker across my living on more than one occasion due to it 's extremely poor design . mr. coffee really struck out on this one considering they are a company that only makes coffemakers . first of all , the water filter device failed after a few uses and would no longer allow water to flow freely through it . this could have been due to the hardness of the tap water in my area but regardless , it 's a filter , it 's supposed to be able to be subjected to not so perfect water . so before i figured out the filter wasnt allowing water to flow i would let it brew and the water would never make it out of the resovoir and would basically just steam up and evaporate . after the entire brewing cycle i would pull the carafe out and there would be no coffee in the carafe . after realizing it was the filter that was causing problems i just simply removed it and didnt use it . the coffee maker worked for a few days but only if you place the paper coffee filter in perfectly . otherwise , the dripping water would cause the filter to collapse and then the grains would run out of the filter , clogging the drain and then voila , you get an overflowed grain basket with dirty , grainy water all over your counters . i do not recommend this coffee maker for any reason . get the hamilton beach stay or go 45234
0	first of all add was deceiving : product description new ! non-slip cascading hangers hang up to twelve shirts or blouses , eight skirts , and eight slacks in the same amount of space it takes to fit a single hanger ! store more clothes than ever imagined in your closet and free up essential drawer space . use separately or hook together . non-slip coating keeps clothes on the hanger and off the floor . durable , chrome-plated . 12 shirt hangers 8 skirt hangers 8 pant hangers the last sentence makes you think that is what you are ordering . also , very cheaply made . 2 were broken in the box , one broke while hanging something up . i ended up super gluing them together . i did not want the hastle of sending them back . beware of this product ! ! !
1	i was surprised by the quick delivery . i opened the box to check the bowls . everything was intact and i was happy to give them to my cousin as a wedding present
1	i bought this knife for my daughter for her birthday . i 'm sure she 's going to enjoy using it . i had the occasion to use it at her house after she unwrapped it and found it to be amazing . it was so well balanced and weighted that when slicing a potato very little pressure had to be applied . now i just have to get one for myself . well , my birthday is coming up in february
1	i bought this for my husband three years ago , and he absolutely loves it . in fact , many people who come to our house ask about it , as the coffee is superb . we are very picky about our coffee , tending to buy expensive brands and grind the beans ourselves , and this coffeemaker wins hands down over the many we have had through the years . i would never consider another brand and would hesitate to buy another model . the coffee is usually hot throughout the day ( depending on how much is in it , of course ) , as my husband always heats it with boiling water before he brews the coffee . we have never had the first problem with boilovers , leaking , implosions ( huh ? ) , etc . in fact , i 'm getting one for my daughter and her husband for christmas , as they always admire ours
0	i received this popper as a gift , and while it looks nice , it only pops of 30 percent of the kernels the rest just sit in the bottom of the machine . i have tried numerous times letting the device warm up for several minutes and also tried different types of popcorn . nothing worked . if i had the receipt it would already have been returned . since i do n't , it is going in the garbage . also for some reasons hot unpopped kernels will fly out of the machine . stay away from this machine
0	they sent me a blue hudson jacquard diamond love seat slipcover 3 times . i gave up after the 3rd time . what really sux is that they did send the olive sofa cover ! ! ! so now they do n't match ! ! !
0	i 've been through four of these expensive units . they work great on my great pyrenees dog . at least they work for awhile . then i end up trying to figure out if the batteries are dead , then if the new batteries i put in were dead to begin with , and then i send it back for repair . once i got back a unit that worked again - for awhile . then i got back a unit that never worked again.i stopped sending in my broken units after that . so - in desperation , and impending poverty , i switched to a shock collar ; it was either that or what my breeder calls a `` blue juice special '' . it also worked - and yes , i tried it on myself and decided that it was n't cruel at all . but the punchline is this : the shock collars broke at about the same rate as the citronella collar . at least they were cheaper , so i did n't lose as much money
0	this is not a 2 quart sauce pan , it is 2.5 quarts , exactly the same as the one that comes with the se
1	this pan along with several others i have acquired from the calphalon tri-ply line is fantastic . great weight and balance , superb craftsmanship , the glass lids fit snugly and most important of all , the pricing is terrific . i have all-clad and yes , it is wonderful but quite frankly i find myself asking why spend more when you can get equal quality for quite a bit less . and it is still made in u.s.a .
1	i recomend this item highly . can be washed without fear of water inside and can be inside the oven while cooking . works like a charm . mik
0	just recently purchased the thermometer and the clip does not hold the theremometer in place . paid $ 6.50 for item and $ 6.34 for shipping and was very displeased/upset with quality of the item . i thought the clip would hold the thermometer in the upright position so you could move the frothing cup in circular motion . thermometer falls over due to clip not tight enough on thermometer shaft .
1	great all around microwave for singles . the only thing it does not do well is microwave popcorn
1	excellent . heavy duty and well made . the satin nickel looks expensive . it stands about 13 `` high with a good , strong support base . it should last a lifetime . jdg 3/6/0
0	was happy with this toaster until i had it for about 4 months . at that time the lever started acting up by not staying down . sometimes it worked other times we had to prop something heavy on it to keep it down . not what i expect from a $ 70 toaster . well , i have finally given up ( 2 months later ) and am sending it back to hamilton beach since too much time has passed to send it to amazon . they are sending me a new one , which i am not sure i am happy about . might just exchange it somewhere for a toaster-oven ... ... ...
0	a drawback of calphalon 's anodized alumninum is that it can not be cleaned in the dishwasher . but stainless steel is dishwasher safe , and amazon 's product description claims that calphalon 's stainless steel line is dishwasher safe . but if you check out www.calphalon.com and look at the description of their stainless line , it explicitly prohibits using dishwasher detergent . so it is `` dishwasher safe '' but you ca n't use dishwasher detergent .
0	this product is markedly inferior to its main competitor , the pur 2-stage dispenser . specifically , i found two main flaws : 1 . the spigot draws water from at least an inch and a half up from the base of the dispenser . as a result , quite a lot of water is left inaccessible for drinking , even after tipping over the dispenser . 2 . even more infuriatingly , the spigot 's connection to the main housing is so poorly designed that it eventually starts to leak water all over the place . the first dispenser i purchased started to leak after 1 week . i dutifully exchanged it for another one , which proceeded to leak after about 2 weeks . it appears that the `` o-ring '' that connects the spigot to the main housing shrinks when it gets cold . . . a rather fatal flaw for an item intended for use in a refrigerator . despite being a lifelong brita user , i exchanged this product for a pur 2-stage dispenser . i am now converted and will never go back . the dispenser is rock solid , and the water even tastes better
1	i wanted to dress up my kitchen a little , and this does the trick ( makes me not dread washing the dishes . an added plus ! ) . it 's a nice cherry red , and i 'm a bit of a `` red junkie . '' i gave this five stars because it 's perfect for my needs . if you have a large family and tons of dishes it 's going to be on the small side though . the red colander 's a great extra , as is the little sponge holder ( it has suction cups to keep it in place , but mine does n't seem to stay stuck . that 's a minor detail , though , and it could have more to do with my kitchen 's tiling than the suction cups ) . one thing to note -- if your sink 's drains are n't centered you might be annoyed with the hole in the middle of the rubber sink mat . overall , this is a durable and nice to look at sinkware set . what more could we want ?
1	i bought this espresso coffee maker to use with warm milk . it is great if you like to make lattes . or just plain expressos . it brews fast , less than two minutes . it makes a great cuban coffee but make sure you use the coffee like pilon or bustelo that comes in pressed packets not the cans . i do not use italian roast because i do not think it would give me the same flavor for my lattes .
1	in 1970 i was given a set of presto waterless cookware along with a pancake griddle . at that time they did n't have non-stick griddles . through the years the handles broke , but the grill fit over my stainless steel sink , so no problem . in 1999 i figured it was time to replace it with a new one . i really loved it because it never stuck and once again i could rely on it . in 2002 i started a pancake breakfast to raise money for our club . it started with my presto grill and soon i added a second one . over the next 18 months we raised $ 3,500 with those two grills , serving pancakes , french toast , bacon , etc . my 3rd grill is still going strong and puts out our sunday breakfasts at home . it is so refreshing to be able to depend upon the quality of an appliance these days . thank you presto
1	i had bought my first fiestaware cereal bown sight unseen from amazon.com , and i absolutely love the rich , cinnamon color of cinnabar ! the cereal bowl comes in handy and we use it for hot and cold cereal , soup , ice cream , and leftovers ( smaller portions ) . it 's microwaveable , too ! if you 've never used fiestaware before , this would be a great introduction to the line , especially if you have use for smaller soup/cereal bowls .
0	the pin is not properly secured to the body of the pitter . after a few uses it will pop off . i 've gone through three of these pitters from my local linens 'n things . how could the designers be so inept
1	the english take their toast seriously , and while i do n't share their affinity for beans on toast for breakfast , i lusted after this gorgeous piece of appliance art at williams-sonoma for years . about seven years ago , when the dollar was still strong versus the british pound , i bought the 2+2 combi model by mail from a restaurant supplier in the uk for about $ 100 less than the then-going us price . while it 's a bit dicey fitting thick-cut bagels into the slots ( not a big bread item in the uk ) , i solve the problem by using the sandwich baskets to contain them . the toasting is even , and i actually the enjoy the old-fashioned timer without pop-up , which keeps the toast warm while the rest of breakfast is being assembled . unlike others , i do not unplug it after each use . never had a problem . the crumb tray is terrific , and actually does catch every bit of crumb without a mess . i 've had the $ 100 krups and cuisinart models , which burned out within two years . this one is made for restaurant use , and i expect it to last a lifetime . worth every penny , if you appreciate high-end kitchen appliances and tools
1	this knife is great for hard cheeses , i can cut them without the slices crumbling to pieces . it feels very comfortable and sturdy in my hand like my other global knife . the blade has a serrated edge so you will not be able to sharpen it easily , but if you only use it for cheese , it should stay sharp for a long time . this is another beautiful global knife
1	i could not resist trying this method of making espresso . you know you can spend alot trying to get a decent product and i have not been disappointed with the practically inexpensive bialetti . the first attempt was successful and that told me this was for me ... .the bonus milk frother made more froth that an old steamer frother i used to have . there are a few tricks with the frother ( 1 % milk by itself not so good but add some half and half to the milk and voile ' ) . the milk mixture needs to be heated enough to coat the back of a spoon , pump it quickly and serve . regarding the espresso maker itself ... .just do n't add any more water than to that line..and oh do n't open the lid to look at it until it is done or you will get sputter onto your stove top . to know when the espresso is done just listen you will know when it is done ... .very quick and yummm
0	i read tons and tons of reviews of this product and decided to take a chance on it . well that chance did not pay off . even in combination with the spray model my cat continued to spray everywhere . if anyone else has ideas for something that does work i would really appreciate it .
0	we bought a well-reviewed carpet vacuum from amazon last year , and absolutely love it . after that positive experience , we were looking for something for our kitchen , bathroom and hallway floors and came upon this cleaner . starting with the dry vac part , that seems to get smallish pieces of dirt fine , but anything cheerio sized or larger it pushes around on the floor unless you lean the vacuum back . which would be fine , but if you lean it back too far , there is a suction filter thing ( made for the wet vac part ) that sticks and you have to turn off the vacuum and wait about 10 seconds for the suction to release that piece before you can continue . anyway , the small dirt and dust are really picked up quite well , but if any of you have small children ( we have 3 boys under 6 ) , do n't have any expectations of this getting up mealtime messes . now , onto the wet vac part , which was the main reason we got this . very disappointing . we used the included cleaner , warm tap water , etc as the directions indicated , and both my wife and i swear the floor is no cleaner than when we started . it does n't look cleaner , shine more or even have a nice smell that we could even close our eyes and pretend it was clean . spills or stains that normally take 1-3 passes with a mop are taking 8-12 passes with this machine . we bought this to save time and/or get cleaner floors , and i can honestly say that this machine did not do either . as briefly noted above , if you have children , do not expect clean floors out of this , and i ca n't recommend this at all . this product may be suitable for people who have no children , no pets and only small dust particles and light traffic ; i just know this is n't our house
0	these are not riedel crystal ! after i returned them , i told amazon that that need to update the description . if you read the fine print , it does say `` manufactured to exact specifications of riedel , austria '' . they are made by some other company , not in austria , and the quality is very , very low . you get what you pay for
0	we had previously bought this same coffee maker new and liked it so much that we wore it out . when i saw the refurbished for $ 20.00 i thought it was a great deal . it would have been if it had come with all the parts and did n't leak ! ! it did n't come with seals or with the water purifier . i tried everything including new seals ( that i bought separately ) . eventually we just went out and purchased a new one , because we still like the model .
0	i always buy products from amazon and i never have any complains about any of them . but about this product , i am so disappoint because the lids does'nt fit with the 32 oz . containers . i hope that they fix this problem because is a good way to keep your kitchen organized
1	getting those decanters to dry without spots can be problematic . this is a big help . the wide base allows better balance than you would think , and is really very secure . i would prefer a larger balance point , but this does the job
0	because just around the 60 day mark , the chime turned into a terrible noise like something dying . i just turned that feature off and continued enjoying the dispenser , but a month later ( 3 months after original purchase ) , the thing is spewing soap non-stop . wasted lots of soap this way . changing the batteries did n't help . soap just flows out until there 's none left . to maintain some customer satisfaction , sharper image should consider backing their products with a better return policy or providing some better quality control
0	riedel 's water glass and gourmet glass are both made in france of glass ( not crystal ) . the stem 's too short for wine in my opinion , but you could always use them for water . the water glasses are more suitable , though , as they have a wider mouth
1	this is a great pan . aside from the fact that it is easily the best non-stick on the market ( and i have used anolon , calphalon and scanpan ) , what continues to impress me most about this pan is its even heat distribution . there are no hot spots , not even the center . when sauteing the food colours evenly ( even when the pan is a little overcrowded ) ; when stewing , you often see tight little bubbles across the surfact of your food , demonstrating how even the heat distribution is . this pan also makes a fine risotto . oh , and did i mention its non-stick is simply the best . clean up is a breeze . nothing sticks . even baked on pasta sauce wipes out with a little water . the surface on swiss diamond is so good that if you make pancakes it is often hard to get the turner under the pancake without sending the pancake to the other side of the pan ! swiss diamond is the king of non-stick , as not only is their surface no . 1 , but the quality of their pans is second to none . i own two swiss diamond pieces , i plan to buy more , and i could n't recommend these pans more highly . this is the pan i reach for the most
1	it 's a towel . not too much to say , for more information , read the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy by douglas adams . very good quality , resiliant , color has n't faded , despite being used to dry me off after falling into a creek , being used as padding for my elbow at the firing range , and wiping up spilled cleaning chemicals . tough little bugger
1	this is essentially the all-clad stainless steel 3 quart saucier fitted with 2 short handles . the `` dutch oven '' sold by all-clad is a similar configuration of the 5 1/2 quart saucier . this is a versatile stovetop pan -- wide enough for frying , deep enough for liquids , good-looking enough to carry to the table . it can also slide into the oven when needed . it may not be big enough to do a traditional 19th century cassoulet , with large hunks of meat and a gallon or so of beans , as one poster complained , but it functions quite well as an `` everyday pan '' for up to 4 persons . the dimensions of 9 1/2 inches by 3 inches ( plus handles ) fit the 3 quart capacity into a compact shape , with a rounded bottom for easy stirring . if you are looking for a versatile `` do-it-all '' pan , this is a good choice
1	this is a lovely little crockpot whose small size makes it uniquely useful for a number of purposes . i 've owned larger crockpots for a couple decades ( currently a 6 quart rival smartcooker is my mainstay for preparing family-size meals ) , but the larger pots take up a significant amount of counter space are n't at all useful for heating or re-heating small quantities . this little crockpot , however , is perfect for heating or re-heating 2-4 servings of soup or stew . i originally bought it , however , because it is *absolutely perfect* for making hot cereal on cold mornings , especially those hot cereals that require more than a few minutes of cooking in the microwave or on the stovetop , such as steel-cut oatmeal ( try the nutty goodness of traditional steel-cut oatmeal once ( also available here at amazon ) you 're unlikely ever to return to instant or `` quick cook '' oatmeal again ) . there is nothing nicer on a cold winter morning than walking into the kitchen knowing that a healthy , delicious hot breakfast is awaiting you . from mid-october to late-march , virtually every night i prepare my entire family 's hot breakfast cereal for the next morning in this little crockpot , with no more effort than is required to make single serving of instant oatmeal or cream of wheat in the microwave . other uses we 've discovered : it 's perfect for making serving hot mulled cider ; keeping hot dips , gravies warm sauces syrups heated on the buffet ; as a substitute fondue pot ; for heating soup at times when hovering over a stovetop or near a microwave would be incovenient ( how nice to come inside from raking leaves or shoveling snow to a hot bowl of soup ! ) . for single people or couples who prefer not to cook in large quantities or apartment dwellers with limited storage space , this crockpot would be a very acceptable slow cooker , especially if used in conjunction with rival 's inexpensive sp100-pdq smart-part module ( also sold on amazon as of the date of this review ) , which provides the same timed-cooking controls that are integrated with many of rival 's larger , more expensive crockpots . the energy used is minimal , too -- only 80 watts -- the stoneware bowl fits easily in the dishwasher , as does the lid , for very convenient clean-up
0	i was tired of replacing wires on my old cheese slicer every couple of years . the blade `` bends '' through a block of cheese . it doesnt provide a straight cut .
0	we got this as a gift used it ... ..its loud and spits out water . we 're not happy with it
0	we bought these for our two girls ( 2 and 5 ) so that they could have dishes matching out stoneware and they were great , for a while . now we are down to 1 out of the original 4 we ordered due to the plates cracking over time ( 5 months since we ordered ) . they have n't been abused and have been washed in the dishwasher on no heat . same issue with the bowls . ymmv , but when 3 out of 4 are dead , i think there is a problem
0	i used this item twice-the second time i had one sweatshirt and one sweater on the rack it broke into 5 pieces ! waste of money
0	i have two earlier aerobeds and they are very comfortable and conforms to support our bodies . this new premier durasuede is like lying on a sheet of tin . the material is so stiff it does not conform to our body . i find it unusable
1	my only complant is that the cord is shorter then i am used to . but i guess it needs to be for the automatic rewind . this feature is a must however since my husband always griped at me for not coiling up the cord properly . it sucks great , is easy to clean , and light weight . the price is fantastic
0	i thought i was getting a good deal and a good product at a cheap price , but instead i got what a paid for and nothing more . cheap product at a cheap price . only used a few times , literally 2-3 times , then one time when my girlfriend put the glass down on the table it broke and wine went everywhere . luckily we acted quickly or else a bunch of carpet would have been ruined . they feel really cheap too . if you only want to use them a few times , get them , i know we will never get these again
0	ordered this item as a gift for my daughter..arrived quickly and did not appear broken or used but would not work at all..appliance would not activate.. very disappointing ... probably why it was such a deal..shipping was as much as the item ! valentine surprise failed
0	okay , i bought for the price . and it is effective enough . but it is very clumsy and unergonomic , so that after a couple minutes of use it is difficult to handle any longer . the main problems are : balance of weight , and the switch . first , the switch : because it is a cheap push-in button , which must be constantly depressed to keep the knife on , you lose optimum control quickly . the handle is badly placed for this , as your thumb must always be on top of the handle and forward toward the front of it , but you ca n't hold your hand up there because your wrist angle will be completely wrong for cutting . in addition , keeping that button depressed is difficult not only because it does require a constant application of pressure at a different direction from both the grasp and the application of the knife , but because the button sinks deep into the handle , so your thumb is inside the handle as you 're trying to hold and control the knife : quick cramp . moreover , as you 're pushing it in , if the food you 're cutting is moist ( like a turkey ) , juices may run onto the handle , your thumb -- and into the hole into which you 're pressing the button . not safe . a couple times i 've wondered whether that shooting pain in my thumb was from nerve torture or electric shock ; either way , it was n't good . then the weight distribution of the knife is not very good . look at the huge bulk of the motor -- and then look at where the handle is located , and how it is designed . there 's no way to hold this at a proper angle with the handle shaped as it is . add in the need to be depressing the power button as you 're holding it awkwardly , and ... 2 stars for effectiveness ; minus 3 for bad functional design
1	i bought a bed a few months ago and had to go out and buy new bedding at some local stores . i hated having to shop around and wish i would have seen a set like this . because i went from a queen bed to a king size - i had to buy new pillows , mattress pad , comforter , sheets , etc . i looked around and if you add up the pieces in the 10 piece set its a great value - plus much easier to buy all at once . i highly recommend this set for anyone upgrading their mattress . i was not able to buy the king size set - but did buy a twin set for my niece as a back to school gift . cheers ! ste
1	my cats love this ! they will play with it by themselves or with each other . it is a little wobbly for my big fat male cat , but he still loves to play on it .
0	i baked six loaves in this machine . i have been using various bread machines for the past 12 years and feel comfortable making adjustments when things do n't turn out just right . my big complaint with this machine is the low baking temperatures . even on the darkest crust setting and the longest baking time ( 70 minutes ) , my loaves were only marginally acceptable - they were not sufficiently baked . i was using a nearly-whole wheat recipe . the machine was quiet , strong , and had a lot of bells and whistles , but with only partially baked bread , i had to return it to amazon . amazon shipped it to me in a very poorly packed box which was gaping open when it arrived , but they included return labels which made it a cinch to send back , and were quick enough with the refund
1	these are called `` fruit bowl '' but they are the perfect size for a couple of scoops of ice cream
0	somehow i stumbled onto this item while searching for `` quiet '' and `` fan '' . now that i review the item description i do n't see any mention of `` quiet '' . oops . the fan 's primary flaw is that it only has two speeds , both of which are insanely high . i do n't need such a mighty wind to just take the edge off of my over-heated workspace . a gentle breeze would be great . instead i have a choice between either a hurricane or a tornado . on the bright side , perhaps this product will bring about a resurgence of interest in the paper weight . and then , one day , frustrated over my choices between a sweltering office or a deafeningly loud fan , i can grab my largest paper weight and use it to break a window , thereby cooling the office naturally . everyone wins ! also , while the fan looks identical to the holmes fan pictured , it is branded as a `` westpointe '' . really . `` westpointe '' with two `` e '' s
1	i forgot the toy needed a battery so for the first few days my cats played with it without the bird moving around in circles , but mostly they ignored it . when i got the battery , and the bird started moving , my two older cats were n't impressed , but my youngest ( about 1 1/2 years ) went crazy . it 's pretty funny watching her with the toy ; she can get fairly worked up attempting to take out the bird . it 's also entertaining when she 's finished playing ; she has a tendency to walk away from it too slowly , which means she is hit in the backside by the bird . naturally , this starts the fight with the bird all over again . i 'm pretty sure the other cats will play with it as well , but even if it 's just the kitten , it 's worth the money
0	i would rate this item -0- star but it is not an option . there are too many styles/models . it is very confusing . check item specifics carefully to avoid getting the wrong style/model . this vacuum has stationary brushes . save your money and pay the difference for the models w/ spin-scrub
0	this blender died after 4 months of light use . i never asked it to crush ice or do anything really strenuous . i only used it to blend smoothies and tofu desserts - so the toughest thing it ever had to handle was a couple of half-frozen berries . after two months the motor started to have that burned smell when i used it . after three months the plastic bottom part of the canister started to crack . at four months , the motor started making funny noises , it smelled terrible , and the crack on the canister widened so that liquid started to spill out when in use . all in all , this blender was a total waste of money and ended up in the trash . i will never buy a hamilton beach product again
0	i wanted to buy something that would remove the taste of chlorine from the kitchen faucet but even with the brita it still tasted like chlorine . after about 2 weeks it started to drip from the where the brita screws into the faucet . so now you do n't have filtered water . my husband replaced washer and it still dripped . if you accidently put the hot water on while someone in the house just before used the filtered part the filter is ruined
1	this set is a great way to get a few basic cookware pieces , however , once you start cooking with this truly outstanding cookware , you 'll want to buy more . over the years , i have spent hundreds of dollars on another well-known commercial cookware brand , but all-clad is far superior . the stainless looks great and is a breeze to care for . the handles stay comfortable and the pots are really well-balanced , making them very easy to handle . they heat evenly and cook uniformly , even over low and medium heat . i am very pleased with all-clad 's performance on my radiant cooktop . i would recommend this line of cookware to anyone interested in quality and performance . well worth every penny
0	one might imagine that the whole concept of vacuuming-flip-mopping is progressive in some way , but it really does not make the job of cleaning the floor easier . especially when the product is heavy and hard to maneuver with poor pickup . i 'd much rather go over the floor with a good vacuum , and then follow with a functional , well-designed good mop ( like the old steammop they discontinued ) . these things function better as seperate units , which is why there 's no washing machine that 's also a dryer . the flip-it is a very loud machine -- so loud , that i did n't hear my phone ring in the same room . this makes it difficult to listen for my 3 children , too . it 's difficult to push and feels like it 's gripping to the floor . it does n't fit into any tight places or under any low chairs/cabinets with it 's big fat part-vacuum head . and , when you 're finished , it 's a pain to clean out the nozzle and the filter ( which you 're supposed to keep dry somehow ) so you can look forward to a second job once you 've finished the job of cleaning your floors . and , because of the `` flip it '' back and forth design , the thing has no equilibrium ... it fell to the floor at least 3 times , even when i was so careful to rest it against something ... once when this happened , the `` dirty water '' recovery tank hit the floor , fell off the machine and spilled the dirty water all over my just-cleaned floor . a true nightmare . i bought this product because i could no longer buy replacement filters/pads for my bissell steammop , and i thought i had better give the latest and greatest a try , but , sadly , i was disappointed . i do n't review things often , but i felt a responsibility to warn others out there who are shopping for a good mop to keep their homes clean . this contraption is not your answer . on a side note , i wrote to bissell to bring back the steammop ( what an excellent product ) , so i 'm hoping that they will one day
1	this is just what i was looking for . i use it for the few dishes that do n't make it in to the dishwasher , but mostly for drying the baby bottles . the bottle drying systems are pretty ugly and can only be used for that purpose . this drying rack is very useful for the bottles and dishes
0	sometimes it sprays when she barks , most of the time it does n't . so i would say its effectiveness has been rather low . it 's not the battery or the fill level - maybe it just depends on the dog . i can bark into it myself and it sprays just fine . ( my children found this amusing .
0	this is an ugly vase . so ugly we are returning it the day we received it . it does not measure up to mikasa standards at all . it looks and feels like a cheap vase one would buy at target . we were very disappointed . stick to the clean , lean lines of other mikasa crystal vases
1	so far , so good . i have a 3mo shep that so far has a blast with this thing . i saw one reviewer that said it tore apart , and will update as time goes by . so far i love them ... .well , she loves them . easy for her to pick up , when the ball is much larger than her mouth ( holes in ball ) the football shaped one bounces in odd directions , but highly recommend the blue one , as dogs see blue well ( color blind )
0	this is a great maker for american coffee drinkers who have the occasional espresso . this will not pass for a full-time espresso drinker . the machine functions fine but the coffee is not robust enough to be called true espresso
1	the quality of the china is very good . the weight and feel of the product is substantial . i was disappointed in the color and antique look to them . from the pictures i thought the color was going to be more of a buttercream yellow rather than ivory white and the antiquing more attractive . they almost look dirty instead of antiqued but the price is right and they are certainly adequate for every day use for my family
1	i 've read a number of complaints about food sticking and difficulty with cleaning . we 've experienced neither of these - make sure the heat is not too high and clean with hot water ! it 's a great saucepan and the price was great . highly recommended
1	it 's kinda hard to imagine dimention on a non standart object . it works , and cleans , i guess a bit small , but for the money its well worth i
1	i bought one of these from a yard sale for use at my small office . i was getting stuck cleaning up the kitchen and decided to see if this little unit was worth it . i 'd looked at the small haier unit and was not impressed with the plastic interior . i broke a lot of rules setting this up . its not connected to the hot water supply , since i have a very old sink and the only other connection i had was to cold water lines . also , the machine is on the floor , under the sink . i bought new hoses to make the connections . luckily , the standard connectors on the back made this easy - the fill is a standard clothes washer fill line , and the drain can take a piece of garden hose . i was concerned with the garden hose holding up to very hot wash drain water , but so far its been okay . ( if i was installing this anyplace else or using this in my home , i might not be so nonchalant . ) my unit was used , from an area where there was very hard water , and the previous owners had never cleaned the innards of the machine . i soaked everything in clr to remove the scale from the sump grill , the heating element and the wash arm , and cleaned the gunk out from under the door seal , and away we went . since we are in an office , we always use the sanitary wash to keep the cooties down . the machine does an excellent job of getting even cold tapwater super hot , and the dishes will flash dry after the cycle is over , if you pop the door open . the machine has no problem pumping wastewater through the drain line and up 3 feet into the sink . one reason i avoided the plastic tub haier is noise . if you load this machine carefully , you can prevent items from clinking against each other too much , and the machine will operate more quietly . we 've found that we can run the machine , have the office radio on , and still comfortably make phone calls without much trouble . my only complaints would be that on occasion , the timer has gotten stuck ( once or twice in 100 washes ) . also , some plastic items have been slightly warped by the heater . capacity is very decent , probably because the machine is pretty large . measure first
0	this steamer performs very poorly . the wrinkles in my shirts just laughed when they saw it coming . now it sits in my closet collecting wasting space
0	the thing did not work right from the beginning and now the tail fell off would not recommend it to anyon
1	i recently purchased the sakura embossed palm 16 pc . dinnerware set for my mom for christmas . she absolutely loves them . they are so unique and when she has company over for dinner gets many compliments on them . nobody has ever seen dinnerware like these before . she is a big fan of palm trees and these fit her collection nicely
1	i think these little candle holders are great for any occasion . and they are n't expensive either . therefore you can buy any color for any occasion to match any room in your house . these can be used for formal occasions or just everyday use
1	i 'm impressed with the quality of these towels . i purchased them because i needed hunter green and could not find that color locally . they are large , soft absorbent towels
1	very nice peeler except it 's missing a feature that every other peeler i 've ever seen has ; a protuberance that can be used to remove the eyes from potatoes
0	i ordered this teapot because at the time it came with a free tea infuser . when it arrived , the teapot was broken , with a large section missing from the side . i returned it and had to pay the shipping to the company to reorder the same item after i received a refund only for the items price . after receiving my second teapot , it was cracked in the exact same spot . i returned the product and complained with no response . i was refunded the price for the teapot , but i am out $ 10 in the cost of shipping . it seems highly unlikely that two teapots would break in the exact same spot , so i would try a different product .
0	i do not think that the batteries were fresh . does n't seem to bother my dog when he barks
0	this towel start falling apart after one wash and a tumble dry on low -- one inch strings were sticking out all over the surface and little balls of frabric ( like dust-bunnies ) formed on it too . perhaps it would be good to use as an oil rag , but not in one 's bathroom
0	this is a lemon/lime press . the oranges in china must be real small , so if your planning on pressing oranges make sure they are small and forget about grapefruit
1	we bought this hand blender to get rid of the problems created by the power cord on our braun corded hand blender . the cuisinart took care of the problem . pros : very good power for blending , good battery charge life , easy to clean , clever modular construction ( battery separates from motor , built-in plug and charger ) , does not roll off counter . cons : larger and heavier than the corder braun . this blender may be difficult to use for people with small hands . very short people may also find use difficult as the blender is over 16 '' long . the surface finish of the plastic housing is very smooth , making clean-up easy . i do n't recommend washing the blending head in the dishwasher as this smooth surface may be degraded over time . the heat of the dishwasher may also degrade the rubber seal around the blender shaft . hand washing is easy and quick . one reviewer suggested that cuisinart 's recommendation of leaving the battery pack/charger assembly plugged in all the time was bad for nicad batteries . this may shorten the battery life , but the charger charges them at a very slow rate ; this protects the batteries from what really damages them : heat from fast charging . as the charger draws only 1 watt of current , some may want to leave it plugged in continuously . current recommendations for care of nicad batteries is to run them down until they no longer supply useful power . do n't run them down completely as was the practice in the past . the cuisinart batteries will charge fully overnight . they do n't feel warm to the touch and this slow charging rate will extend their useful life
1	this mug absolutely comes through as promised . hot beverages stay hot even hours later . it 's totally leak proof and easy to disassemble for cleaning . i am very pleased with this purchase ! the only thing that i am not completely satisfied with is it 's size . i would have preferred something a little wider , but the ability to fit in any drink holder is what the manufacturer was going for ... ..unfortunately it tends to move around in mine , but it does n't spill any thing
0	i have owned a few oxo brand utensils over the past few years , and in general i have been happy with them . but i was disappointed with this spatula when the edge of the head melted the very first time it was used . the product description does warn you that it 's only heat resistant to 250 degrees , but i was flipping eggs in a skillet , which i consider a basic use for a spatula . if it ca n't handle the heat of a hot skillet , than i do n't think it 's a useful spatula . not to mention that it 's neither healty nor esthetically pleasing to have bits of black plastic in your food
1	if you want the retro look and a super toaster ... ..this is the one for you . toasts perfectly and looks great ! i 've had it about 4 months with no problems whatsoever . make sure to measure your countertop area before ordering ... ..it 's a big toaster . shape is unusual ( taller in back than the front ) which gives it a little character ! excellent !
0	i have two cats both less than 5 months old . i bought citikitty training kit hoping it would save me from scooping the litter box . it turned out a piece of flimsy junk that 's way over priced . my cats would rather do their business anywhere but on this piece of plastic . save your money and use it on something more useful
0	the machine looks great . it sat nicely on our counter-top next to the kitchen aid mixer and looked really classy . if that was all i wanted to do with it , then i would have been very happy with it , but i actually wanted to make decent lattes and espressos . firstly , i found the steamer wand to be awkward to use . it rotates , but has little movement up or down . as a result , i found it pretty impossible to steam milk without spilling some on the counter-top when i was finished . it produced good foam though . secondly , the indicator lights are so dim i found it difficult to tell whether the machine was ready or not . finally the espressos i made had no crema at all . i have been making them for 3 years with our current saeco machine with a delightful crema on each one . after pulling the shot it continued to leak water from the filter holder . the machine was constantly leaking water steam when it got up to temperature and the design of the drip tray is such that it is awkward to empty it without spilling everywhere . in summary : if you just want a pretty machine to sit on your counter , buy this machine . if you want to make decent espresso-based drinks , do n't
1	i searched for a long time before i purchased this product and have not regretted my decision to buy . like all ice crushers it is a little noisy .
0	first i liked this press - good coffee , reasonable price . but in 3 weeks operation , the press itself has already broken . the plastic holder for mesh filter has broken ... may be this pres is good for ones a year usage , but not for everyday ...
0	we bought this rice cooker because of the reputable brand name . we have been using it for about 4 months now . it cooks good rice . however , the rice does not stay fresh for over 3 days sometimes regardless of what other reviewers said . we 've got spoiled rice in it a few times already with no understandable reason . and the rice was in `` keep warm '' mode at all times . in addition , if you forget to stir the rice and leave it in the `` keep warm '' mode for a day , the top layer becomes very hard and the bottom layer becomes very soggy . so , you do need to stir the rice quite often to prevent the dryout . i have n't tried cooking porridge or any other kind of rice besides white rice . if i were to decide all over again , i would stay away from this rice cooker . i thought i 've bought a top-notched product , now i regret that i spent this much on a rice cooker
1	this dish rack fits into small spaces and holds a decent capacity of plates , etc . perfect for a small apartment kitchen ! love it !
1	my 13-year-old cat was limping for a few days , off and on , and my vet said it was probably arthritis . a friend had told me that giving her arthritic dog nutramax cosequin had helped him , and i already knew that regular cosequin has helped me with my arthritis , so i bought a box of nutramax cosequin for cats from my vet for my kitty to try . it really made a difference ! he stopped limping and could walk farther and faster on our walks together around our lake . he was so happy , and so was i . on my vet 's recommendation , i continued giving him one tuna-flavored capsule each day , sprinkled over his food , as a good preventative to slow further joint deterioration , all without the side effects which he might have gottten from prescription medication . i would highly recommend this product for cats and dogs as a first line of treatment for arthritis ; and buying it from amazon saved me about 2/3 of the cost from the vet .
0	this waterer is a great concept , but does have some drawbacks . for starters , one of my dogs is scared to death of it and wont come near it because when the water level in the bowl gets low it gurgles just like a water cooler at work . the first time it happened she was drinking out of it and it freaked her out and now wont go near it . the other dog is just fine with it , but then again he 's deaf , so the gurgle does n't bother him . lol . the other issue i had with this is just like all water bowls , it gets dirty . so you still have to clean it as often as you would any other water bowl , but it 's a bit more cumbersome having to take the big jug off , clean the bowl and but the jug back on . so , if your dog is n't afraid of the noise it makes and you do n't mind the extra hassle cleaning it , it 's great . otherwise , just get a large bowl ; that 's what i ended up having to do
1	my dog absoluely loves this toy . we have had one since she was a puppy , over 6 years ago , and its still going . this is the only toy that she will play with for hours on end and gets excited when she see it . definitely worth buying , it gives great excercise . we sometimes use it as a distraction when our dog gets anxious
1	i received this knife for christmas after reading the review in cook 's illustrated magazine and then requesting it on my gift list ! my son ordered it through amazon and it arrived before christmas . it is now my favorite knife and is used daily . after cutting veggies , fish , meats , and fruit , this knife continues to be extremely sharp , well balanced , and easy to use . what a great gift
1	the riedel syrah/shiraz wine glasses are a nice combination of fine glassware , yet also have a sturdy feel
1	i have tried all kinds of feather pillows and foam pillows but just could not get comfortable sleeping on my side . while shopping for a new mattress , i came across the simmons beautyrest pillow . what a difference ! it provides great support but is still soft and comfortable . now i do n't toss and turn all night , and i actually get up earlier in the morning and feel rested for the first time in a long time . i definitely recommend this pillow for people who sleep on their side and are looking for good support
0	the towel is quite soft , however after using it , your body will be covered with small fibers all over . - not recommended
0	i bought this for my husand as a gift and it is awful . it fell apart the first time we used it . it even caught his hand when it fell apart and drew blood . i do not recommend this product at all .
0	the other commentators stress features of this kettle that pretty much any cordless electric kettle will have . it pales in comparison to my old hamilton beach , however , in several respects . well , really , one big one . it 's a plastic object . and it gets very hot . too hot . hot enough that it smells like it 's melting itself . i got this as a gift , rinsed it thorougly , boiled a pot just to clean it - and it stunk like melted plastic . ran it again to try and get the smell out . same thing . rinsed it with cold water and tried again - still melted odor . the outside of the kettle near the heating element was very hot even after it shut off ( a problem i did n't have with my previous kettle , which i lost in a move ) , and when i touched it a melted plastic film tacked on to my finger . you can bet i put this right in the mail back to amazon . i normally would hesitate to return a gift , but i 'd rather the person have his money back than this thing sit on my counter collecting dust
1	i 've had my juicer now for about 3 years , and i have n't had any problems with it . in fact , after having had several juicers , this one is my favorite in the price range . i also do n't understand the customer service problems . one of the rubber feet on the bottom split , and i called customer service . a week later i had four new ones in the mail ! pros - much quieter than most juicers of its type . as well , i did a side by side comparison with my buddie 's juiceman juicer , and my yield was approximately 30 % greater . cons - as with any other similar juicer , cleaning it gets old . that 's probably the only think that keeps me from using it multiple times/day
0	i would not use this unless it had a featherbed on top . i have two other waterproof pads from bloomingdales that are more expensive but much softer
0	the pans look very nice and very durable-but they are not ! ! ! save your money do not buy this ! ! ! i had to put them through the dishasher a second time to remove some more of the sticky residue on the bottom of the pan from the label . when they came out of the dishwasher there were rust spots all over them . i am going to try and return mine as soon as i get a chance . i never even got to use the pans before they rusted . it should be noted that a ) the pans were never left soaking in water or in the sink b ) there was not anything even the tiniest bit rusty in the dishwasher with them to have `` rubbed off '' rust onto them or anything like that . horrible , horrible pans-they should be ashamed to make or sell these ! !
1	i received the 10 pc set from my husband for christmas . i have been very pleased with the quality and how easy they are to clean after use . some veg did stain the bottom of the saucepans . maybe this will disappear if tomatoes are cooked in them . the pans take longer to heat up because of the thickness and the weight but once they are hot they cook evenly . i feel we made a good choice
0	i am extremely happy with this product . it works like a charm for making pancakes and they never ever stick . it 's a superb design and i am very pleased . i would highly recommend it
0	i returned them beacause they are nothing like the good old revereware made in the u.s.a.they are very thin and cheap.i do not recommend anyone buying them , you willonly want to return them
0	while the water tasted better , this model did n't last for more than about two months before leaking and eventually spraying water all over the place
0	i have sold a number of this style timer made by kitchenaid in pink , black and white . almost every buyer complained . all complaints were that the ring is not loud enough to hear if you are in another room , have a fan on or are listening to the tv or radio . replacing the battery does not remedy the problem either . if you want a kitchenaid timer invest in one of the red , black , blue , white or tangerine ones that are entitled digital timer with rotating dial - no one has any complaints over this style of kitchenaid timers .
1	i bought this chocolate fountain for a 3rd grade class valentine 's day party . it was the talk of the whole school . the kids loved it . i used sephra chocolate ( a coupon was included ) , so i did n't have to mess with adding any oil . the chocolate fountain worked great and left quite an impression . the cascading , flowing , chocolate was n't quite as perfect as the pictures on the box , but it probably would have if i would have added a teenie bit of oil , but the pure sephra chocolate tasted devine . i also saved $ 25.00 by buying the chp ( champaigne color ) version
1	these mikasa spoons go perfectly with your demitasse or espresso cups . very delicate with nice finish . we enjoy them every time we use them
0	i am very disappointed with this humidifier and its filter . it consumes about 1 filter per month and if you keep the humidifier off for more than 2 days the filter dries up and you might as well throw it away
1	i really like these glasses . they are attractive and pleasant to hold . i prefer having a wine glass that does n't contain a lot of wine - which is why i got these since they are the smallest in this line
1	i love that it has a mini bowl . so much less storage . also it runs so much more quiet than my old hamilton beach . i am so impressed . love kitchen aid anything
1	this sharpener is exactly what i hoped for . i have used it enough to overcome the learning curve and am very well pleased
0	i 'm a student in college , and when my first hamper ripped , i decided that it was time to buy a sturdier hamper . my roommate rarely does his laundry , so he has huge loads , but his hamper manages to carry it all . i saw the whitney design hamper online , which looked nearly identical to my roommate 's hamper , so i bought it . when the hamper arrived , i put my clothes in it , and prepared to do laundry . the shoulder strap ripped right off . i did n't even fill up the hamper all the way , as is shown in the picture . amazon sent me a replacement , but now i am afraid of using the shoulder strap again , and i have to awkwardly grasp the sides around the metal wires . this hamper may be able to function , but not well . and for a college student , this is definitely not sturdy enough
0	had this grinder for 8 months . two large cracks have formed in the side of the unit , now they are widening and trapping lots of coffee grounds . i 'm tossing it and getting a different brand . all form , no function
0	read the fine ( or missing ) print carefully . this is not a general purpose vacuum purchase . you need to buy the carpet attachment to be able to vacuum carpets ( another $ 100 ) . if you want to return this item , they charge a restocking fee of 10 % and also deduct for the shipment ( even if you got `` free '' shipping ) and you pay to ship the thing back . we ended up buying locally from sears and are much happier with it than from central vacuum stores - which is where the miele came from .
0	this coffeemaker does not keep coffee hot and fresh for hours as the user booklet says , even if you first fill the carafe with hot water and let it set before brewing . if you want a cup 45 minutes after brewing , it is luke-cold ! i was emptying the carafe right after brewing into another thermal carafe that actually keeps coffee hot just to avoid reheating cup after cup in the microwave ! it is hard to clean and very loud
1	very good rice cooker . the steam function is very useful for such a lazy student like me . i can cook the rice and steam my food at the same time . i used it for almost a month but still working functionally . highly recommended if you dun wan na pay too much for a useful rice cooker
1	i internet shopped for a week , reading consumer reports and customer reviews of just about every blender made . i decided on this one based on my research and i am glad i did . i make my husband fruit and juice smoothies almost every day after work and with this machine it is a fast , easy job . ice and frozen fruit are blended into the drink very quickly . it is a little loud but it is worth the noise to have 500 watts of power . i also like the fact the base is heavy cast metal , the pitcher is thick , solid glass with a tight fitting lid and the blade is stainless . i like the easy to use control knob and the fact it has 2 , yes just 2 speeds . i find most machines with 12 to 20 little buttons are fairly useless and all those speeds rarely used , they also take up more counter space because the bases have to be bigger for all the buttons . the fact that the hamilton beach comes in 6 colors is just icing on the cake and the moroccan red is gorgeous .
1	i 'm very happy with this mixer . it arrived in pristine condition , even though the box it was shipped in looked very tired and worn . the machine does what i ask of it with no glitches or complaints . i bought it mainly for bread making , and after a certain amount of practice , i 'm turning out great products . i also have discovered that scoop shaped measuring cups work wonderfully for adding flour and other ingredients , so i think i will pass on the idea of purchasing a splatter guard . my only gripe is not with the machine , but probably with amazon because i did not get the model that was pictured . i got the hd . i have researched as much as i can , and the machine i received is probably identical to the one i thought i was getting , but i just do n't understand what is so difficult about matching the picture with the product that one is buying . seems kind of elementary to me
0	the armoire arrived with the doors damaged and a nick on the top . i was sent new doors but they did n't fit . frustrated , i accepted the promised $ 175.00 off to keep the doors , knowing they would have to be repaired by my husband later . i have yet to receive this refund . the delivery was also a major problem . there was only one guy and he said he was told to leave the furniture in the driveway and go . there was no way i could get this furniture in my house alone , so i tipped him to bring it in for me . i will never buy anything from this company again ! ! ! ! ! !
0	i had high hopes for this nightlight after reading other reviews , but it is n't so hot . the light is n't very bright and quite diffused , and the light sensor is n't sensitive enough - it stays on in all but the brightest light . i ordered two , but have only opened one , and the other is likely to stay in its packaging
1	it does everything i need it to and more ! i 'm a raw foodist so i do n't need something that will `` cook '' foods like some of the other high-powered blenders will . however , if that 's what you need one for , this will do that , too . the l'equip is the only blender i have ever used without the lid ( not advised for households with children ) . i can start it out at a crawl and go up to blindingly fast with a turn of the knob . i liked my original one so much that i bought one to have at the office so my green smoothies could be made fresh for lunch . alton brown was showing off his appliances on `` good eats '' and he has a l'equip , too . made me feel famous
1	these are gorgeous bowls . they are my preferred bowl for baking and cooking . i am very satisfied with them - no discoloration problems and they clean up very easily . and they look fantastic on my pot rack
1	this is the cutest comforter , not the softest , buy my son loves it ! i had n't been able to get him to sleep in his own bed all night but as soon as we got this it was no problem . he loves to sleep in his 'thomas ' bed !
1	i love the large size of these tumblers , as i can get a whole can of pop with ice in them . the thermal feature works good , the ice lasts longer , and they do n't sweat , so i do n't need coasters under them . they are colorful , so each guest can have their own color , no mix ups . they fit on the top rack of my dishwasher , and they do n't seem to be marked or scratched yet . after seeing mine , my daughter-in-law got some , as did two sets of my friends . i am so glad to have found them !
1	have had the granos for about 1 month . great espresso , great latte and great design . i hope all the leak issues i read below have been solved , but only time will tell .
1	perfect for anybody who appreciates no-frills , straight lined , attractive furniture . it 's modern and sturdy and a great match for my kitchen dinette set . i love it ! and the price is right , too
0	sure , it looks nice enough without anything on it . but if you plan to actually hang coats and umbrellas on it , pick something else . it 's tippy and it does n't hold very many coats without the pegs cracking and breaking off . it 's cheap , but you 're getting less than what you pay for . it could n't last a winter when being used by only two people
0	while the wine pourer works as advertised i am disappointed that the company appears to have discontinued the wine stopper i was originally seeking . i was after the pourer that came with a `` flapper '' at the top that acted to preserve the freshness of the wine in between tastings . while the above item fits the bill as a spout i personally find it useless
0	i bought this item - `` drinkwell fresh water fountain and reservoir for cats or small dogs - fountain ( 6 cup capacity ) '' from petsmart at amazon . though the title clearly advertises that a reservoir is included , one did not arrive . i contacted customer service who told me that the reservoir is not included and would only assist me in ordering one . otherwise , the unit is nice , though simple . i will be returning it used to purchase elsewhere
1	i used this skillet for the first time and it was great . i love cast iron but the enamel coating sure made this easier to use . it cleaned quickly and required no seasoning . also , its a really pretty skillet . the sellers were really good also about emailing with order status updates , shipping info and the skillet came quickly through fed ex . very good customer service
0	after just a few months of occasional use the lever to lower the bread would not stay down . i see now that others have had this problem . typical `` made in china '' junk . no more t-fal for us
0	when we first bought it , it worked nicely and smoothly . thought we do not need to buy another opener again . boy were we wrong ! after the third use , it will open only a small gap and the handle will just keep spinning . reminds me of a car turning it 's wheels will all smoke and noise but no results . glad we still kept our old opener from a much lesser known brand . this opener certainly does damage to the kitchenaid name
1	i think i 'm a little crazy for buying this . i just had to find out if the copper-core was really better than an aluminum one . it is , but not by that much . you can buy a pan from cuisinart 's multiclad series that will do the same thing almost as well for a much cheaper price . that being said , this thing is very well designed . the rolled-lip is useful for pouring . the radius of curvature where the bottom meets the sides is large enough to allow for utensils to easily get in there ( a problem with most pans ) . the handle stays cool and is well designed . overall , this is the best 2-quart saute pan money can buy . is it worth it ? that 's up to you
0	its a throw . like a blanket . i would have been better off with a pretty cutain to think of it . it would be better than what i wasted my money on . also dont wash this with anything else . the die leaks
1	this came to me just in time to solve several cooking applications that have been bothering me since the holidays . as a lasagna pan it is the perfect depth to make a stellar presentation . as a roasting pan it works well and holds a small turkey or two 3 lb . chickens . it 's also good for a large casserole for a pot luck . the pan looks good from oven to table . yes - it is heavy to work with because of the cast iron , but i 'm really glad to add this to my pantry .
1	there was no dimensions on the description so i took a chance . it was a bit smaller than i thought ( about 2.5 '' cubic ) , but that happens to work out perfectly for my purposes . it is lovely , and the color really adds to the kitchen . my guests all loved it
0	you never ever use an electric wok to cook chinese food . it is all about the fire and the intensity of the heat . only people that use this are people whom have no idea what they 're doing . do yourself a favor and purchase a real wok
0	i bought this for my mom and had it sent to her address . it worked for two days and then it stopped . on my last visit i fiddled with it for an hour , but it only worked intermittently . she did n't keep the receipt so i 'm writing it off as a waste of money . when you think about it the inexpensive softsoap brand push pump dispensers make more sense . you can see when they are empty and you do n't have to keep up with batteries . i do n't buy the argument that the hands-free dispenser is more sanitary than the hand pumps because after you touch the hand pump you wash your hands
1	for $ 19.99 , you 'll not find many knife sets . i paid that for one kitchen aid santoku knife ! this set includes a long slicer/utility knife , one large paring knife , and a 5 or 6 '' serrated knife . the knives consist of good steel , comfortable grips , and are well balanced . they are very sharp and sturdy . i could n't find a better set for the price . i was looking for a decent utility/carving knife and a large paring knife when i found this set . i use mine as the `` disposable '' knives . for this price , you wo n't have to worry about beating up on them . and they sharpen up quickly , too . the red color is very festive . the grips feel like silicon , so they work when wet and greasy . and pleasantly squish when you grip hard . if you are in the market for a fine , high level kitchen knife , these may not fit the bill . but if you are looking for good quality , inexpensive knives , you wo n't find better in this price range . i paid $ 19.99 dec-200
0	the seals are not air or water tight . there is no problem with the cansiter or the clear window , but i can not store any flour or rice type products as the seals are not airtight and allow bugs in them . the canisters themselves do not rust and the lids are not easy to remove
1	this is wonderful . i have arthritis and my sister got the litter maid , but that ended up having to be scooped on a regular basis which was hard on me . i actually enjoy working with this . the only drawback is sometimes smaller clumps of litter can get stuck below the drawer , but using really good litter , and not too much of it stops that . i told my sister she should replace her own litter maid with this
0	after reading the reviews on this product i thought it would be a great space heater for my apt . i could n't have been more wrong . it barely gets hot - even on the highest setting - and gives off almost no heat ! ! perhaps mine is defective or got broken during shipping , but it was a huge waste of money . i have had to go out an buy another space heater already . it is so frustrating . one word - do n't !
1	i just received this griddle today and am so disappointed to find on the small print on the box ( and not in amazon 's description ! ) that this griddle can not be used on ceramic top stoves . it 's a beautiful piece of cookware , heavyweight and with grease pour spouts at the edges . exactly what i wanted , but very unfortunate that amazon does n't tell you that it wo n't work with some stoves . the warning on the box actually says that using this griddle on a ceramic stove can break the ceramic top . probably would have given it 5 stars if i could have used it
1	it is hard to find spoons for tall drinks . these are excellent quality- nice heft and good looking as well . highly recommend
1	using a chemex requires water to be heated in a tea kettle prior to brewing , and it requires a finer ground than what auto-drip machines ask for . after the water is brought to a boil , it 's important to wait for it to cool just slightly ( about 30 seconds ) and then you need to wet the grounds in the filter , wait for them to drain , and then fill the pot with water . want more than a single cup of coffee ? you wait for your first pour to brew , and then fill the filter again . some advantages over other forms of coffee brewing : 1 . taste : i do n't know how it does it , but the filter does keep your coffee from being bitter . 2 . cleanability : users can keep all necessary components clean ( anyone who 's brewed water and vinegar through their coffee maker to kill off a bitter taste that was n't there when you bought it understands this plight ) . oftentimes , the most aggressive criticism of the chemex is its ponderousness to clean because it 's not possible to get your hand into the reservoir . some people prefer to add hot water and soap and give it a good rinse , which is fine if you clean the moment you empty the pot , but if you 're like me and you let the remaining sip or two sit until a nice coffee stain is on the glass , then you need some good 'ol fashion friction to get it clean . the best thing i 've found : a baby bottle cleaner . it 's narrow enough to get into the reservoir and the angle can be adjusted to scrap the walls , too . brilliant ! 3 . electricity free : as long as you can boil water , you can have coffee . 4 . mud/sludge : french press and stove-top espresso-style brewing always leaves a thick slime at the bottom of an otherwise rich cup of coffee . do n't get me wrong : i think that 's good ( i use a french press when i 'm in the mood ) , but the cone on a chemex does n't allow that at all . 5 . style/size : the chemex coffee pot is a relic ( designed in the 40s ) and the wood cuff with rawhide tie screams simplicity and elegance and it 's a wonderful , minimalist sight on any kitchen counter ( and unlike electric coffee makers , easy to move if you need the space ) . some drawbacks any purchaser should consider : 1 . time : it does take 5 - 10 minutes of labor to get the morning cup of coffee . 2 . cones : you ca n't run over to wal-mart when you use the last filter ; you need to find a specialty store or go online , which means you need to plan ahead . 3 . cold coffee : no electric hot plate ( thank god ) means coffee not poured and consumed immediately gets cold quickly . you can buy a wire guard and a glass lid so your chemex can be warmed on the stovetop . i think that 's more labor added to an already laborious endeavor . just have a warmed thermos ready and use that to store any unused coffee . 4 . learning curve : it does take some time to get the grind right , the amount right and the water level right to find a cup which caters to your tongue . 5 . cleanability : i know this is in the advantages column , as well , but it 's worth mentioning that a lot of people hate cleaning these things . to submerge it does mean pulling off the wood cuff ( which is a small pain ) else it will get nasty over time
1	i bought this knife and block set as a christmas gift for my wife . she loves it . our only disappointment was that the block was a different style than that shown on amazon or , for that matter , on the box it arrived in . the picture showed a block with six slots for steak knives . the block we got is the one now shown in the amazon add . apparently henckel made a change in their set about the same time i ordered it . we can live with the substitution though as the knive set is now selling for $ 50 more than what i paid for it in december 03 . i would have bought the set regardless of the block design but the steak knive slots was a nice feature that appealed to me . the knives are well crafted , have a great feel , extremely sharp and we love them . there were two extra slots in the block that accomodated another henckel knife we already owned and one other . we also love the selection of knives , especially the paring knife and small serrated knife . some other reviewers have mentioned scratches or uneven sharpening but we 've not noticed either of these conditions
1	the price was excellent . ordering was quick and easy . delivery was prompt . the high quality of the muffin rings was matched by their performance in the kitchen . they performed flawlessly on my electric griddle .
0	i tried this knife at sur la table at the furi demo . they appeared to be very sharp . however i did not like these knives for the following reasons 1 ) i dont care much for the cheap plastic-like orange handles 2 ) the finish on the knives appear to be cheap . furi implies that these knives are made in germany . however they are cheaply `` made in china '' . now generally i dont care that much .. everything is now made in china anyways.. but when i am paying so much money for a product , i was hoping it was made in germany or usa . 3 ) the case is even more cheaply made . personally , i would wait for a sale on the global or the wustof knives
1	i read a few not so favorable reviews , mostly stemming from problematic attachment of the stand ( which mine does not suffer ) , but i decided to order it anyway , figuring the potential upside eclipses any issues with the stand ( you can also wall mount it ) . well it has paid off , as the magnets work as promised , the tines stay sealed tight , and the tops rotate to open two different sized outlets for the spices . i pitched the included spices and filled it with my own . as for labels , there are many clear preprinted labels available for purchase here or elsewhere to accommodate your own spices . i honestly have never seen a better designed spice rack , and it has worked beautifully
0	i loved this vacuum initially . you can even see how much dirt it 's picking up ! however , the shape of the filter severely limits suction almost immediately , to where the vacuum wo n't pick up a speck of lint . you ahve to empty the filter every 5-10 minutes . i do not have a terribly messy household , just one with no stairs going to the front backyard
1	this bread tray is perfect plum ! ! the color is amazing , and the tray is so useful for so many things ! ! get several of these !
0	when i first got this item i loved it i used it 4 times and it stopped working
1	i overheard a flight attendant raving about the neckbones and also saw it reviewed highly in shape magazine . i still have not tried it in the car or on a flight , but am excited to . it does feel comfortable , though is bigger than expected , so pay attention to the dimensions before you buy
1	wow , this salter kitchen scales is highly accurate . i always get a perfect bake everytime . i definitely recommend this product . you 'll never be disapointed with its quality .
1	this toaster makes the best toast of any toaster i have ever owned and it looks great ! i tossed my blue plastic cuisinart , which at best made mediocre toast , and had that icky plastic worn out look . this toaster is metal , sturdy and has a great retro look in today 's colors . mine is red . i also bought the matching coffeemaker and the drink mixer - a quick and cheap way to update the kitchen . amazon service has been great and with the $ 25 off i got some great buys
0	i had researched this product for juicing ability and power . i ended up buying this one and after using it *twice* the motor just shut off . i returned this product and waited 3 months for the replacement . i decided to try juicing carrots and celery , and after no more than 5 minutes the motor just shut itself off again . i might be able to forgive this if it was the only problem with it . if you are juicing small things , like berries , with larger vegetables/fruit the unit will get off balanced shake the top loose and damage the blade . i know i read these bad reviews and said , oh that wo n't happen to me ... but it did . i hope you choose a different juicer
0	i set it up for my dogs because they bark whenever they hear a noise or if someone rings bell , i have 3 dogs , i put it on and they went beserk , they started going after each other , i did n't hear anything myself , but i am quite sure the dogs did , like i said they acted very badly towards each other , the tone must have made them lash out like that . i can not use it anymore .
1	this is a mid-size whisk , not a full-size one . if you understand that you 'll be happy with it . it is a simple item , does what it is supposed to , and looks great doing it
0	i wanted a humidifier that was silent , but when i plugged this in , not only could i hear it from the other room , but it 's a high-pitched whine . i do n't know what to do about it . i think i 'll probably just return it for something different
0	the problem with this is that ( as it appears to me ) villaware has tried to cut corners by re-using all but the plates as it has on it 's panini grill ( which for the record is an excellent product - which i have given rave reviews ) . check out the panini grill - unless you had these products in front of you were able to open them up , you 'd never be able to tell the difference between them . i would say , do n't write off villaware products just because of one poor one , as i said i also own the panini grill love it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! however , do n't waste your money on this one - i hope villaware does right by their respected name pulls this off the market completely . one thing i will say , the `` audible warning sound '' that was mentioned in a previous review is actually a click - the same as the panini grill , but listen carefully or you 'll miss it
1	the best product ever ! i have 5 cats ... and let me tell you ... if it were n't for this product i would have gone insane a long time ago ( or i 'd just have a very stinky household ! ) have used it for a long time , and will continue to do
0	i was very hesitant to spend close to $ 160 on a single fry pan , but i had heard so many good things about all-clad and thought it would be a wise investment . for the first 6 months , the pan was great . i loved the large size and used it often . i was just about ready to invest in an entire set of all-clad cookware when my pan warped . i was using it on an electric stove as usual , and the pan just simply warped . i was thoroughly disappointed that a $ 160 pan would warp during normal use . i wo n't be spending this kind of money again . ****follow-up . i contacted all-clad regarding the warped pan-they had me send it in for evaluation , and yesterday a brand new one showed up at my door . i 'm impressed at their customer service and the fact that they stand behind their product .
1	i have never used any other dehydrator 's and found this very simple to use , clean , store , and the price was great . plus it makes my house smell great when i 'm using it . so far i have only dehydrated fruits and vegetables and still have to get used to how long to leave things in the machine and how to prep them however , the instructions really makes it very easy and overall i 'm finding it enjoyable to use .
0	i placed a substantial order , mattresses , sofa set , table set and cocktail tables with this vendor and they cancelled my shipment becuase the cost to deliver the items they said was `` too much '' nothing in their ads states they will cancel your order for such a reason and they state the shipping charge on the items and their site . this was a great inconvenience to me and i feel they are not a reputable dealer and do not conduct their business in an honorable fashio
1	i wish i would have bought the regular one instead of the paperback version . i love this light . i can see everything and do n't get the shadows hindering my reading . i prefer to read in bed and this allows me to do so without waking up dh
1	the refill accessory ( in both 50 and 70 oz sizes ) definitely cuts the refill-maintenance in half . since it doubles the capacity you only refill half as often . you still have to clean the fountain regularly as recommended . a different reviewer mentioned that the clear reservoir is not dishwasher-safe , and that warning is stated quite clearly in the manual . throwing caution to the wind i ignored the warning and now have an oddly-shaped container that with some squeezing still works as expected
1	we 've had this toaster for over a year and my family loves it . it toasts consistently . it accommodates all widths . and the digital selector is great
1	this worked as promised and turned out some very dainty little madelines- cute as a button ! it works the same as the large madeleine pans , and is made from the same heavy weight metal , but the result is darling . would be great for tiny `` garnish '' on a larger dessert , for a tea , or just because some people prefer small doses of good things !
1	love this product , excellent cheese cutter , three choices of thickness . highly recommended
0	my order was cancel because company will not ship to a fpo fp address , really unclear as to the reason , but i am sure it is a fine product , my turtles will continue to bask on their rock
1	love it that it keeps the butter soft and spreadable and fresh . this one holds a larger amount than others i have had . it is a bit more awkward to hold , however . it has a wide lid with no handle so you need to grab on to the sides of the lid to pick up . love the emile henry colors
0	this product is the worst there is . i purchased it in a target store going by the oster name . it takes forever for it to heat up and then another long wait for the waffle to be almost done . needless to say i am taking it back .
1	i got this for our 3-year-old daughter 's room as for some reason she does not seem to like the sound of a radiant heater . it does a decent job of boosting the heat level in the room , which she needs because she tends to kick off her blankets during the night . i would n't rely on this alone to heat a room unless it was a very small room . the top and back do get hot , although you 'd have to keep your skin in contact with it for several seconds to actually get burned ; bumping into it should not cause any burns . i have n't noticed any odors or noises from it
1	we bought this topper to replace a worn out topper of a different brand , that after 2+ years was no longer bouncing back into shape . this serta topper is just fine , as comfortable as our last one . my big complaint is that someone at serta ( though serta is n't the actual manufacturer ) needs to measure a queen sized bed , because this topper falls about an inch short on all 4 sides . if you place the topper in the included protective cover , it 's several inches short on all 4 sides . i know 1 inch sounds minor , but if you 're a stomach sleeper and tall enough where your feet hook off the end of the bed , the topper does n't protect you feet from the stiff edge of the mattress . as far as toppers in general , we have found that a huge advantage is the how much they help isolate movement across the bed . you do n't feel your partner moving around nearly as much with a topper ( though presumably with a full tempur bed isolates even more ) . definitely choose a topper with the highest density you can afford , and the thickest you can afford
0	i bought this item because other comforters from this seller had good reviews , but it was a complete mistake ! it really was dingy like described by other reviewer . i returned it , but lost over twenty five dollars in back and forth shipping costs for this item . i highly recommend against this product or seller
1	i bought this for my grandmother who cooks for two . it is small and compact enough to put in your cabinets and does n't take a lot of counter space while you are using it . its the perfect size to make pancakes , eggs and bacon ! we used it to make grilled cheese , and they came out perfect ! this would be great for singles , college students , and anyone who likes great things in small packages
1	the product came in a slightly damaged plastic cover pouch ... there was a smudged dirty smear across the damaged pouch area , which came out with laundering . other than that , the sheets are great . the lace needs starch and ironing . the fitted sheet fits over two twin beds that are made for individual remote adjustment positions of the mattresses , these two beds are put together to make a king bed . this product was a christmas gift and it was well received
1	this maker pours well and has a soft handle . we actually found one at a department store so we were able to see it in person before ordering it online . nice little coffee make
0	i returned this -- absolutely unusable . could not keep bottle engaged while pulling down the two rather unforgiving arms
0	i 've own my x3 for about 2 years now and overall , it has been used to make one double espresso daily . so when it stopped working a month ago , i was heartbroken . called ff , after some back and forth i sent the machine in for repair . the cost of repairing it is about $ 200 , incl . the shipping . add that to the $ 499 i paid for it and this turns out to be one very expensive machine . after several days of back and forth with customer service , i still do n't know what exactly is not working in my machine . apparently , there are 3 items that have failed , one being the thermostat , a washer and something else , that cs was unable to explain . i really liked the machine when it was working , so i gave it some serious thought of shelling for repair , but at the end decided against it - i rather purchase a new rancilio silvia . when i called the cs with me decision and asked them to send the machine back , i was told that on top of the $ 12 shipping there will be a $ 13 handling charge for packaging the machine . i refused to pay that and the rep turned outright nasty . long story short , i finally got them to send the machine back with just a shipping charge , but that was one very unpleasant experience . it is a whole another issue what additional damage they might have done to my machine after the nasty fight i had with them . i really liked the x3 when it was working , and i would love to have it back , but it is just not cost effective at all . what is really confusing to me is that with the low usage my machine had and the maintenance i provided , it has 3 parts needing replacement - if this was a good quality machine , it should have worked a lot longer without any problems .
0	as of today , 3/24 i have not received this product . very disappointed with delivery
1	i 've have looked for a very long time for this lighter quality and easy to wring out washcloths . they are also a nice large size . so many of the thicker washcloths can only be used once or maybe twice because they can not be wrung out properly . the colors of the towels are also beautiful . i 'm buying more for our guest bathroom . thank goodness i searched on amazon . i do n't believe these wonderful martex new splendor items are sold anywhere else
1	great to have crust all around on your cornbread slice ! ! ! you have to spray the pan really , really well with cooking spray then heat it before you put the batter in to allow the cornbread to come out in one piece . i run a little spatula around the edges before i dump the pan . gave one as a gift at christmas and it was a hit ! ! !
1	when i got this i was a little worried it would be too cheapy b/c the materials are light-weight . but , i set to putting it together and the directions were very easy and all the pieces were there and when i got done i was estatic . it was just so easy and looked so good ! i have a very small laundry closet and it fits perfectly next to my dryer and stands about 3 inches below the top of the dryer and is the exact depth of my dryer . unlike other reviewers , i find it rolls very well and is not flimsy or wobbly at all . maybe they overtightened it and stripped the bolts
0	i bought this underwater lighting system with four laser beams and when i installed it one of the beams came defective and did n't lit on ; i did n't matter because they look beautiful underwater ... one week later i noticed that another light went off and two days later the other two shutdown too ; i replaced the beams but they stop working days later . it 's my opinion that this is the worst product you can buy to your aquarium . ( unless you only want to use it for one or two weeks )
1	this is a well built pizza peel . i gave 4 starts instead of 5 because it showed that it was in stock and would ship with 2 day delivery . they actually were out of stock and it came a week after i really needed it .
0	i did a lot of research and chose this juicer based on reputation , motor power and style . i exchanged the first one and am now going to have to exchange/return the second one because it automatically turns off after about 90 seconds , even if nothing is being juiced and the motor just runs ! it is not the electricity as i have used several more powerful appliances in the same outlet
0	my husband brought home this neat black coffee maker , deliberately choosing one without a timer - the less bells and whistles the less can go wrong . . .right ? how can this company not even get the on-off button right ? ? ? it 's so cheap , when you push it , the `` lighted button '' just pushes right in , and does n't turn the coffeemaker off or on . why did n't we keep the box and receipt , so we could return it ? ? $ 20 down the drain do n't buy this
0	these sheets feel like sandpaper ... .they didnt fit my pillowtop either , thankfully , so i had to return the
1	instyle magazine takes its readers into the lives of celebrities and makes them accessible . the features are very informative and fun . i enjoy the man of style feature and the entertaining guide best ! for more on mags , visit my blog at magazinediva.typepad.com
1	i 'm pretty critical and picky about the magazines i read and elle is one of the few that raise the standards . a lot of the information given , whether its clothes or advice , is very practical
0	the amazon ad said next day shipping . took over a month for the first magazine to arrive . do not buy this from amazo
0	but that 's the lowest we 're allowed to give . this magazine is more for 16 year olds and up . too much focus on getting a boyfriend and making out - every 10 year old 's top priority right ? plus my daughter found extremely crude language in the latest issue - magazine refused to discuss the matter when i emailed and called them ! says it 's geared for girls 8 and up but that 's a huge age span . better off with american girl magazine - this one 's to mature for younger girls .
1	when i was little , my dad always said good things about this magazine . my attitude was always `` i 'm not gon na buy a magazine to bore myself some more '' - i mean , c'mon , it 's a history magazine . i was absolutely wrong . i picked up this magazine one day and i was hooked . i would say that american heritage has found its way to make history interesting . one way that it does this is to somehow weave issues of current interest ( as subtle as they may be ) into its articles . on the second thought , i should have listened to my dad from the beginning - he 's an anesthesiologist - he knows what put people to sleep and what does not . this magazine keeps me awake - sometimes i would put my paper/project aside just so that i could finish my copy in one sitting . it 's unfortunate that this magazine only comes out every two months . american heritage makes history grrreattt ! ... even for a non-history buff in his early 20 's like myself
0	please see tj-mccarthy 's review elsewhere here ; he is , to borrow a phrase from across the pond , spot-on in his comments . just this week i cancelled my 10-year subscription to pc magazine . one thing not mentioned elsewhere is that the new editor , jim louderback , has dropped the old tagline on the front cover , `` an independent guide to technology '' . i conjecture that the reason for doing so is that this magazine is no longer independent and is , in fact , just a marketing vehicle for various products . if you are like me and you do not like stealth marketing , stay away from this publication
0	this magazine fell apart so quick . they are no longer a unbias magazine . instead they are a interscope propaganda machine . just look at the covers ? every year shady/g-unit gets a automatic 8 covers . every album from that camp gets automatic xxl and xl ratings . even the horrible tony yayo album got a xl maybe the most disgraful rating i 've ever seen in hip hop . as a hip hop reader i can never take anything they write serious because they are tainted and corrupt . i suggest you search else where if you want a good hip hop mag
0	this mag needs a new editor . i have n't seen anything interesting in better homes for six months . maybe they are spread too thin with their website and contests
1	although the target audience is stated to be 8-12 year old , my seven year old is completely fascinated with this magazine . she has thanked me countless times for the subscription and looks forward to each month with anticipation . not only are the stories lively and entertaining , they are educational as well ( i am also learning various things about history and culture that i did not know before ! ) . there is a good mix of fiction and non fiction stories as well as poetry . since receiving this magazine , i have noticed her excelling more at reading comprehension and her own story writing skills . these reasons are why i believe it is well worth the money and i wll be renewing our subscription for a very long time .
1	car and driver is the multi-purpose auto magazine . it is a hybrid between magazines like road and track , which focus on the exotic and the extreme in the auto world , and magazines like motor trend , which focus on the more practical . the magazine is always a fun , intereseting read , and keeps you up to date on teh auto world . i must , however , say , that it does not do as good of a job at rating cars as motor trend , and it does n't have quite the coverage of the exotics as road and track ( and definitely falls short of road and track 's superb photography . )
0	if i could give it a zero or negative rating i would . when vibe was introduced , it was a relevant , interesting magazine that exposed me to new alternative , r and hip hop artists . the mag featured all kinds of artists not just who 's hot right now , it also featured hard hitting expose articles that were relevant to not only the hip hop community but the world . lately i 've noticed that it 's nothing more than a fluffy version of the source . i hate a lot of new rap music that 's out and did n't appreciate mags with rappers i dislike on the cover . and is it me or does it seem like since mimi took over , all of the female r singers ' covers and stories are horrible ( we wo n't even discuss that disgusting brandy cover ) ! this magazine sucks now and the only time i check it out is while i 'm in line at the grocery store . yes , the subscription rates are cut to the bone now but that is because the quality is supremely lacking . i 'd advise the curious to check issues out at newstands or where ever before wasting your hard earned money on a subscription
1	i like this magazine but i like simple scrapbooks better . it seems as though they have the same featured scrapbookers layouts in there all the time ... just from what i 've observed anyway . i like the layouts , they have good ideas , great tips on tools and some good tips on digital scrapbooking
1	jeff goldblum 's character in `` the big chill '' said that he could n't write an article longer than the average person could read during a , er , `` trip to the library '' ( wink , wink , nudge , nudge , know what i mean ? ) . the writers at details seems to have the same marching orders . in these hectic times , maybe that 's not so bad . the articles i have read are well researched and nicely bite-sized . i actually finished the entire magazine between pm mail delivery and breakfast the next day . the topics they covered in my first issue ranged from fashion to health concerns . and , again , they cover the topics in very few , well-written pages . i do think the models look like under-fed children but at my age , that could be tunnel-vision ( grey hair , i remember filmore east , you get the picture ? ) . my suggestion , take a look . it 's a magazine with an interesting voice and it may be for you .
1	first , i received this subscription as a gift for the holidays and can say that it is the gift that just gives , and gives , and gives . this magazine has been a wonderful source of ideas for in the kitchen , on the grill , around the house , in my garden , in the state as well as all through the south for traveling . being a woman who moved from the detroit suburbs to florida so i could be with ailing family , i was really a duck out of my elements . i had no idea of what was where within the state ; what are good places to visit , where are some of the great attractions outside of orlando , the keys , and the everglades and who does what where . in this magazine , there are sections devoted just to florida ( which i suspect they do for each state per subscription ) -- what to plant when , what festivals are going on , what 's hot and what 's not - a whole derth of information devoted just to the state i live in . and that 's not all ... not only do i get to learn more about where i am today , i can explore and learn about where i 'd like to go tomorrow . one month , it 's `` welcome to alabama '' and all the wonderful gems it has to offer . another month , i am poring over beautiful georgia . a different topic ? seafood of the south . how would you like to learn about fantasic , but yet unknown , places for bargains and great finds ? now - i am also an avid cook at home - and i can not tell you how much i love to read through and try/improvise on all the de-lish recipes found each month closer to the back of the magazine . how many differnt ways have i learned to make potato salad alone is worth the cost of admission ! i have learned so much more about grilling , vegetable side dishes , breakfast treats and savories from all over the south , tempting , lip-smacking desserts - and everything in between . i have always known the south was the jewel of the states when it came to cooking - but w.o.w ! so much history and fun can be shared whether it be in the kitchen or on the grill . and it is a great compliment to what i learn from other books , the food channel , and beyond . it speaks to where i live , what i can get down here , and what the heck plantains are anyway : - ) i love looking through many of the decorating ideas , the travel tips , and vignettes of different states , or towns , or themes . the only reason this magazine does not get a 5 from me is that it sometimes caters/addresses a crowd which can afford more than i can in the way of travel , decorating , etc . i am more simple , down-to-earth folk , and do not share much with `` decorating your summer cottage '' , or what to do with that spare $ thousand plus dollars on a cruise , or splurge excursion . sometimes , and since they are not making this magazine specifically for me i am not going to be able to relate to everything , i am not the crowd they are talking to . otherwise , this magazine is a 10 in my book : - ) well worth the money - but even more so - the anticipation of next month 's `` explorations ''
0	a friend of mine got me a subscription to this magazine because i like cooks illustrated . this magazine is nothing but ads for snazzy expensive foods and restaurants . there are so few recipies in it i would n't call it a 'cooking ' magazine . what few recipies they do have do n't explain why they chose the ingredients used or give much detail at all . if you consider yourself a 'foodie ' who likes to go to fancy restaurants and likes to know what 's hip on the latest gourmet food and wine , then this magazine might be for you . if , however , you like to cook and know what you are doing and why you are doing it , try cooks illustrated instead .
1	i 've been reading men 's journal since the first issue . i 've always enjoyed its mix of content . mj interviews a wide range of interesting individuals . over the years i 've incorporated some of the workout tips from mj 's fitness pages into my workout routine . i especially enjoy reading the product reviews . the travel recommendations are always well written , if not sometimes beyond the budget of most readers ( myself included ! ) . overall , men 's journal offers a great mix of well written content
0	i found this magazine to be helpful for an introduction to advanced computing . that 's about it . this mag seems to be biased towards certain products & amp ; manufacturers . they neglected to open my eyes wider . the reviews/articles that are published seem to favor big money companies ( microsoft , dell , etc ) . they do n't give credit to smaller , better , less-well-known companies and technologies . all the info is pretty basic for intro users , but if that 's what you are interested in ... then this is a great non-comlicated publication
0	esquire is a subpar men 's magazine , in my opinon . more than half of the magazine is advertisements , and when you finally get to the articles they are rarely entertaining and/or thought-provoking . if you like ads and cologne samples , pick it up . after all , it is pretty decently priced
1	in christmas of 2005 i decided i wanted the most interesting and best cooking magazines out there . but which ones to pick ? after buying one here and there i found three that i absolutely love . saveur was one . the recipes are nice though some i would n't touch with a ten foot pole ( ethnic ingredients that do n't appeal to me ) . but the stories and the pictures ... they are n't just amazing , they 're astounding ! where national geographic talks about certain things or places , saveur takes you to different places and shows you what 's there and how they eat . they showed me ireland and i even made colcannon ( a mashed potato and cabbage dish ) everyone loved it . i made a french dish last night that was amazing . it was a little time consuming but worth it ! i do have admit i was a little disappointed with my first issue i received from them with my subscription . it looked like a dog ate it then ran through the water with it . it 's readable but i was n't happy . they also promise two exclusive magazines for new subscribers . i 've never seen them . but i have been getting my magazines and they look good . i was thinking about it the other night , my three magazines i picked ... one was articles and recipes about healthy eating ( eating well ) , one was easier recipes with no articles ( everyday food ) , and then saveur . if i could only pick one to keep ... it would be saveur . it 's really that good of a read .
1	still think that marie claire is a cut above most women 's magazines
0	i was very disappointed with this magazine . the tech reviews have absolutely no depth to them . most articles are rather pretentious and boring . in the 5 issues i have received so far only the may 2006 issue had any thing interesting . and it only had two articles which were worth it . the first was `` robbed blind '' which was about rfid chips and the second article was `` diy ways to go green ''
0	good housekeeping does not send a notice to the person receiving the subscription in a timly manner . it should n't take 2 to 3 weeks to receive notification
0	well , imagine my surprise when i picked up the february 2004 issue , and found that things had drastically changed . mainly in the editor 's letter . it used to be 1 page , now it 's just a small little column now , that is exactly like other ziff davis game mags , now the redesign isnt as bad as other zd game mags , but the removal of the 1 page editor 's letter , really steams me up . at least they didnt bother executive editor robert coffey 's scorched earth column . it 's still 1 page . it 's on the last page usually . and yes the redesign is really bad in terms of readability . most of the time they have a red or blue or yellow background , and it 's really hard to read the text at times . now at least their disc will auto-load , unlike pc gamer . and what really pisses me off , is when a magazine has a hot 100 section , or a best pc 's or videocards , or peripherals section , and they hardly ever change the captions or descriptions come with it . i 'm sorry if i got off track a lot , but i felt the need to . i hope this review helped you . edit : 5/8/2004 pc gamer recently changed editor 's and the editor-in-chief was re-assigned to become the editor-in-chief of the official xbox magazine . the new eic of pcg is the former executive editor , and i hate him , so this is why i say cgw is now the best pc games magazine
1	this magazine provides interesting stories and information about american history and cultural life . most often it is very pleasant reading .
1	i 've received the whole dog journal for the past year . i have found it to be refreshing as it has no advertisements . it 's pure holistic news , information , health , nutrition , training , food testing , and anything else pertaining to dogs ! i would recommend this magazine to new dog owners as well as seasoned . one thing about the world of dogs is that it is ever changing . it 's not always easy to get information that is up-to-date , helpful , and necessary . with the whole dog journal one can be certain that they will have the best knowledge
1	this magazine is ... well ... sweet . i love it . i picked up a subscription in january and i think it 's great . they get previews on a ton of games , even those that are n't that gossiped about . they bring a vieraty in opinions when it comes to there reviews . they get a scoped up article on new games very fast . they 're not centered on only the good games , but they also include a `` shame of the month '' ( lowest scoring game of the month ) award . they include three scores from a scale of 1-10 and the reviewers simply put out the truth and down right say that a game sucks . they have full coverage on new platforms and games . they also include posters and stragety guides with some of their issuses . this magazine is alot better than the dragonball z obssessed , gamepro . its fast and relibel . definetly a great buy .
0	i am utterly disappointed in the direction that gamepro has taken over the past two years . i actually stopped my subscription for about 1 year , but came back to the 20 issues for $ 10 at their ( 10 ? ) year anniversary . i forget . but the magazine is really bad . one thing i laugh is , the retro corner . they have info about issues from 5 and 10 years before , and they always announce the number of pages from 10 years ago . i think the most recent issue , they said : 140 pages ? huh ? i think my last issue was around 100 . and do n't try to tell me they 've lost 40 pages in advertising . too bad on-line reviews and websites , are taking over the subscriptions of the hardcopy magazines . i 'll stick with hardcopy until the end of my life . or until the quality of these types of magazines gets so low , i ca n't stand it anymore . or until my subscription runs out on this craptacular effort . you guys were pretty good 5 years ago , but you 've gone to pot these past two years ! i 'm talkin ' to you watchdawg ! ! ! you guys are suckin ' lately ! ! ! mc white said : you guys are suckin ' ! !
1	i highly recommend highlights for children . it 's a great way for children to begin reading in a very fun way . watch your child 's eyes read with delight as they have fun with puzzles , hidden pictures , games , and fun and entertaining stories . cynthia marie rizzo , author of julie and the unicorn
1	ok. for those of you who continue to believe that new york is the center of the united states , hell , the world , who forgot the map cnn kept flashing with the two different colors after the election that might infer there are several schools of thought about the polycentric views of the us , for those of you who can take a little criticism from the midwest , the dark states , middle earth , the elba of the 21st century , you 're not . there 's a whole world out here . people have jobs . yes , it 's true . we work , send our kids to school , even go to church on sundays . and on other days too . we vote . oh , yeah , you already know that . so having an interview with an actor who goes on about how he meditates , is a vegan and thinks about trees and birds when he has a particularly stressful scene with ashley or uma or diane , you know , it just does n't carry a lot of weight with the serfs . but . . . . it 's a great magazine . andy lives . photography is tight and realistic . the ads are sexy and provocative . the sidebars interesting and insightful . it 's wordly . it covers music as well as rs . it 's ( do n't get all riled up now ) a fun magazine to read . however , the interviews which we are led to believe are the heart and soul of the magazine , seem to be along the lines of 'damn , it 's so good to be me and i guess you 're ok too . ' or , 'i see you 're wearing a $ 15,000 versace with a plunging neckline and . . . you 've selected old , black , converse all stars to wear with it ! how noveau ! how tasteful ! ' come on . where 's the bite ? where 's the interview with alex rodriguez that says 'how come you went to therapy . . . it 's only new york ? ' or with marv alpert 'hey what 's on your fashion agenda now ? ' chris berman from espn says he was on maui a couple of years back and he was walking with his kids one dawn and he ran into steven stills with his kids . now that 's a conversation i would have liked to hear , not one that ends up with me thinking the two parties to the conversation ( it sure is n't an interview - see columbia university 's interviewing 101 in their school of journalism ) are off to pick out furniture . it 's new york . show your teeth . flex . 5 stars . larry scantlebury
1	as a library administrator i get to see and read an awful lot of woodworking books and magazines . i have been a personal subscriber to woodworker 's journal for a year now , and an off and on reader of the magazine for about 5 years . in that time i have grown to appreciate this as a very good woodworking magazine . is it my favorite ? no , but i still like it well enough to recommend it to others . i also regularly read fine woodworking , workbench , wood , popular woodworking , etc . and like all of those , this magazine has its strengths . i find that wj is very into power tools , tool reviews ( theirs are among my favorites ) , and shop projects . having said all of that , i also must confess that the best piece of furniture i ever built came from a plan in wj magazine ( an arts crafts style wine storage table ) , so do n't pigeon-hole it too much . try it for a year and i bet you wo n't be sorry !
0	i bought into a subscription of this magazine sight unseen . that was a bad decision . after having received two issues , i continue to be disappointed . the quality of the art design , and products displayed overall are dreadfully amateurish and in most cases incredibly tacky . i would be hard pressed to think that anyone in pursuit of help with romanticing their home would be inspired by this magazine .
0	i echo the same gripe that other reviewers have voiced here : the magazine covers the same handful of people week after week after boring week . how many times is a reader going to see no talents such as jessica simpson , lindsay lohan , the tom cruise-katie holmes joke , and the most overrated , overhyped people of all time brad pitt and angelina jolie on the cover and not get tired of it ? it 's nice to know what 's going on with certain celebrities once in a while but every single week ? can you say `` overkill ? '' i 'm glad i never got a subscription to this magazine . i picked it up every once in a while on the newsstand but stopped because i was so sick and tired of reading about overrated , overhyped and glorified b-movie `` actors '' and `` actresses '' who were lucky to be in one successful movie and have n't done anything of value since . i picked up a copy today and have sworn it off forever . do n't waste your time or your money . - donna di giacom
0	i am sure this will be a great magazine , but i have not received my first issue yet
0	so i ordered the magazine in nov. 6 , 2005 . its now feb. 22nd , 2006 and the magazines ( since i also ordered the smithsonian and scientific american ) are nowhere to be seen . of course , my account was quickly charged and at this pace , i 'm guessing the whole genomic structure of all living organisms in this planet will be decoded before i receive any of them ... so if you actually want to read this excellent magazine , it might be a better idea to get somewhere else..
1	well i echo what all the other reviews have said about this magazine . subscibing to this magazine is making sure that unbiased articles can still exist for all makes and models of sports cars . you see there are extremely few ads in this magazine and so even though the mag is a bit smaller than say a car and driver magazine it is loaded front to back with reviews . one after another . the photography is fantastic and just looking at the pictures makes you wonder what some of the other mainstream magazines could be like if they could just try to put out a better quality product . even the cardstock of the paper is first rate . it makes the car and driver mag feel so cheap in comparison . both come to my address and i honestly can say that i look forward to both but for different reasons . i first stumbled upon this magazine at an airport 6 years ago and i am so glad that i did . i would love to see more articles with affordable sports car alternatives as they print at the end of each issue . i remember an article about what used sports cars you could buy with certain dollar amounts and this was to me ( a man on a budget ) a rather nice look at the market as a whole that year . also we are not all 16 year olds out there subscirbing to this magazine so it would be nice to see road tests on at least one moderatly priced non exotic each issue . thank you for putting together such a high quality magazine for your readers to enjoy .
0	i was one of entertainment weekly 's charter subscribers way back in 1990 . it started out great -- a different , intelligent and witty approach to entertainment coverage . but financially , things were shaky , so the magazine was dumbed down a bit to reach a wider audience . i could n't blame the editors . it helped them reach the needed tipping point , and they gained their needed mass audience . ew remained better than any other publication with an entertainment focus , and i kept resubscribing . until 2006 . these last few months , ew has fallen off a cliff . it has become entirely superficial and shallow , with hardly any substance at all . the publication design has also been degraded into a teen magazine format . i can only imagine the editors have decided that anyone over 30 is no longer part of their target audience . so , i 've let my subscription lapse -- reluctantly , mourning the enjoyable magazine that used to be
0	this magazine seems to exist solely to promote their advertisers and their products . their articles focus heavily on their sponsors and the ads far outweigh what little content there is . when they do focus on the best work of the design community , their examples are puzzling . they choose work that is often genuinely awful , and you rarely see any of the work that wins awards in other publications and award shows ( comarts , adc , graphis , aiga , one club ) . while that would be admirable had they found other good work , most of the work they highlight is mediocre at best . there is a reason this magazine is free

1	men 's health magazine provides informationand tips on men 's fitness , health , sex , career , relationships , nutrition , recipes , weight loss and muscle building.no matter how much you know about men 's health , there 's always room to know more about ways to a better lifestyle , the top men 's health concerns , and the importance of getting medical care and regular screening tests.so you deserve to pay more attention to yourself ! take better care of yourself physically , mentally , and emotionally . or if you are a woman searching for ways to help the men in your life , tell them about the men 's health . one way to start is to use the resources you 'll find in the magazine here.this magazine is dealing with all aspects of the daily lives .
0	where are the critiques ? the articles lack any critical substance . whoever is hot at the moment will get their behind kissed . it does n't matter that the album is usually not worth all the hype , vibe will go along with the flow . on top of that , there are more ads now than ever before . even articles that could have been decent are cut down to a page or so for the sake of saving advertising space .
1	sports car international never loses focus on its mission : providing insight into everything that defines a true sports car . i do not need to waste time flipping past crossover reviews or cup holder size specs . from the absolutely most exotic and expensive supercars to the new hard-top mx-5 , it just sticks to real sports cars . seems simple , right ? yet no one else gets it quite as right
0	this magazine used to be very thorough , and it used to be very good at providing me with tons of deals and tips that i never would have found on my own . it was great , and very opinionated . but last year sometime , they changed the look of it and now there 's a lot less text . it 's much more a style magazine now , and that 's not what i want in a travel magazine that i have bought to tell me about money saving ! worse , except for the 40 best vacation bargains , which are still okay , most of the articles forget to incluce a lot of money-saving tips and instead they too often suggest i do expensive things . since when is a $ 225 a night hotel considered budget ? ? the headlines and captions are expecially smart-aalecky . it 's not as good with the expert advice as it used to be ! i noticed that arthur frommer is n't editing it anymore which maybe is why -- bring him back ! my search for a true money-saving travel magazine has unfortunately resumed again
0	i subscribed to this magazine for a year and found it a waste of money . every issue has a girl in a bikini on the front ( ca n't a woman look sexy in anything but ? ) and every issue claims to have `` the best ever exercise for ... . '' ok..what about the last 10 issues that claimed to have the same thing..those exercises are no longer `` best ever ? '' i did n't like the fashion sections , and i also do n't like how there really are n't any articles . when i subscribe to a magazine i 'd like to be able to read it , not just look at pictures . the only thing i liked about it were the success stories..and even those seemed repetitive ... are we only allowed fruit and grilled chicken ?
0	i ordered the magazine `` all in '' on october 10 , 2006 for my boyfriend for a christmas present it is now jan. 15 , 2007 and we still have n't received the magazine . my checking account was charged for these magazines the very day i purchased the magazines so ... ... ..i payed for something 3 months ago and still have n't received them . i dout that i will purchase anything else from amazon.com on line penny stephen
0	i ordered this magazine as a gift . not only was there no gift card sent , but the company sent the magazine to me instead of gift recipient . it took about 20 minutes on the phone with the subscription company to fix the problem and not once was there any mention of an apology for the inconvenience . the biggest disappointment was not having a gift on time !
1	inc. magazine is a publication designed to guide small businesses on their path to prosperity . with inc. , you get timely advice on taxes , marketing , financing , and many other important considerations and challenges that business owners face every day . probably the strongest point of inc. is the way it presents important information to readers . the authors of this magazine get directly to the point . they do n't waste your time with petty discussions and attempts to soften the blow of an undesirable fact . even when the news is bad , like with regulations , taxation , etc. , inc. lets you have it in a direct manner . this is good , because i get annoyed by magazines that try to ease the reader into hearing some unwelcome news and then try to downplay the facts . inc. writers are direct , and i respect them for that . if there were some criticisms to be made about this magazine , i can think of only two : the lack of articles geared toward startup businesses and the tendency of the magazine to highlight success stories that , while nice to read about , present personal success that is a little out of reach of most business owners . inc. is designed for small businesses that are already established and need some guidance for growth . this is fine , but i would like it a little better of there were more articles on getting a new business off the ground . and , every now and them the magazine goes off on a tangent and interviews someone who is very rich . again , this is ok , but i would prefer to read about ordinary people who are only moderately well- off because these stories and the individual level of success they portray are more realistic . still , inc. is a very good publication for small business owners . it provides some good , timely advice on how to help your young business grow and how to handle legal issues and concerns . the price to subscribe is low , too , making inc. magazine a must for owners of small , growing companies .
0	please see tj-mccarthy 's review elsewhere here ; he is , to borrow a phrase from across the pond , spot-on in his comments . just this week i cancelled my 10-year subscription to pc magazine . one thing not mentioned elsewhere is that the new editor , jim louderback , has dropped the old tagline on the front cover , `` an independent guide to technology '' . i conjecture that the reason for doing so is that this magazine is no longer independent and is , in fact , just a marketing vehicle for various products . if you are like me and you do not like stealth marketing , stay away from this publication
1	the author of the declaration of independence and promoter of a bill of rights for the u.s. constitution , thomas jefferson once wrote : `` i read no newspaper now but ritchie 's , and in that chiefly the advertisements , for they contain the only truths to be relied on in a newspaper .

'' and so , dear reader the nation is filled with sunlight that too many americans can not stand to look into directly . it is much less painful for them simply to say : `` ... the nation 's political bias is so far to the left that it repeatedly errors in its evaluations of the american and world - situation . '' for those who wish to know the simple truth of what is going on in america and the world read the nation . it prints the patriotic , incisive truth .
1	i was so happy to pick up meridian . it 's a great mix of fiction and poetry and i could n't put it down until i finished it
1	found this magazine when i visited australia and subscribed to it immediately . i have every issue and i refer to them all the time ... the recipes are easy to follow and have relatively few ingredients ... .and are always delicious ... .a real winner and her books are great as well
0	it took forever for this magazine to get to the address and it also is shipped a week to 2 weeks after the magazine is already on the stands . what 's the point of having a subscription if you get the magazine later than everyone else ? i will never order a magazine from amazon again , i 'll go through the actual magazine company instead
1	this magazine is a must have for professional poets
0	i would n't know if this was a good magazine , i have yet to receive it , after waiting three months . it is cheaper to order through food and wine website anyway
0	frst of all i kno nothin bout this magazine but wen i came across readin this kids review sayin tat yayos nd jeezys cd were garbage forced me to write a review ... frst of all yayos cd has at least 4 hits on it.. - so seductive - eastside westside - pimpin - curious - i know you do n't love me - live by the gun and for jeezy 's album i admit there wasnt as many hits if any but the cd was one of the best albums tat came out this year w/ a new flow of southern rap and a lot of good songs ... .trapstar..my hood..bang ft t.i ... .thug motivation ... .and then what ... all good songs ... im not sayin jeezy is one of the best rappers or at the top not close..but if he comes up w/ a new album better than thug motivation 101 he will be up thea cuz of his new flow of souther rap and high energ
1	i love entertainment weekly . this is a magazine that has everything current ... outline of plot , reviews for movies , music , tv , dvds , books . it keeps you current . it is the one magazine that i go through from cover to cover
0	psychology today purports to deliver the latest trends in psychological studies to the layman , but what it really delivers is pop psychology and a whole lot of advertisements . i give the magazine one star for a very snazzy layout , and a second star for hiring writers that do n't insult the reader 's intelligence by abusing alliteration ( unlike another magazine supposedly aimed at intelligent adults ) . however , the content is consistently concerned more with pop culture than with the lives of real people . i have also noticed a bias against introverts in article after article that attacks shyness as a serious character defect , rather than simply a personality trait ( so , introverts , if you want to avoid yet another lecture on how your way of relating to the world is intrinsically wrong , avoid this rag )
1	this subscription is the way to go if you are sick and tired of finding the last copy of q magazine for sale on the newstands is missing the 'enclosed ' cd because some chump has stolen it before you could . this rock music magazine is superior to others on the market , in my opinion , because it has excellent production values , i.e . luxuriantly thick and glossy paper and high quality reproductions . as a bonus , the writing is superior and highly imaginative . an expecial favorite section of mine is the 'man on the streets ' section in the back where concert goers are canvassed for their opinions on the show they have just watched . i like it because the reporter is sure to get a good cross-section of the audience and it clues one in on the reaction different types of people have to the band . in addition , this magazine covers us and worldwide bands that may not be as well-known here in the usa as they are in uk ; often these are bands that we might want to know better . the reviews section is always great , and usually the magazine will highlight a mini-section e.g . 'best r & amp ; b albums from the 1970 's , in which lost gems are rediscovered for the reader who may be too young to remember or even know about these artists . this magazine will have you finding , buying and liking albums by bands you 've never heard of , and who can beat the home delivery aspect for nickels more than the newstand price
0	i 've been a people subscriber for 2 years now i quite agree with the majority of reviewers ... same celebrities , different week . if it is n't tomkat/kitten , it 's branjelina or benifer 2 . oh , and we can not forget `` mrs. oops , i did it again '' spears-federline . very little on real people/human interest stories anymore , very little ... as for the actual magazine , it seems i 've become , through no choice of my own , one of people 's quality control employees . after subscribing , i informed customer service of my allergy to their scented inserts . i was told a note would be made to my account and i would no longer receive inserts in my magazine . here is where my job of qc employee came in , with my having to remove these inserts several times the first year , then again the second year in which i made another call to customer service . they apologized . stated there was a note on my account regarding my request then they offered to extend my subscription for two more weeks . next problem and part of my `` new '' job requirements ... reassembling my magazine . i received at least 4 or 5 issues of people put together either backwards , upside down or with half of the magazine in the front the other half flipped over in back . in order to read and enjoy these issues , i had to remove the staples , try and rearrange the pages then line the pages up by the staple holes to reinsert the staples . again i called customer service to complain . again they apologized then offered to extend my subscription another 2 weeks . i 've since written to cancel my subscription . i 've not heard a word back from people inc. , regarding this . we 'll see how it turns out
0	this magazine comes with lots of advertisements - 70 % or more . plus , articles ( less than 15 articles in every issue ) in the magazines are not very useful . i subscribed the magazine because it is inexpensive and it is rated high by other subscribers . now i realize i made a mistake .
1	i 've been a faithful subscriber to `` america 's civil war '' since 1993 , and i 'd say that it 's easily one of the best history-related magazines in existence . i read each issue cover-to-cover , even the letters to the editor . long after i first started studying the civil war almost 15 years ago , i 'm still learning a lot from this and other magazines like `` civil war times illustrated '' ( which is also great ) . in each issue of `` america 's civil war '' you can find a variety of articles in the following categories : personality ( which focuses on a specific soldier of officer ) , eyewitness to war ( great first-hand accounts from both soldiers and civilians ) , men and materiel ( weapons and equipment ) , reviews , commands ( focuses on individual units ) , preservation ( of artifacts and historic sites ) , and of course several articles which can cover a wide range of topics , from battles and leaders to politics and slavery . although i wish more would be written about the neglected western theater , i feel that the articles cover most aspects of the war very well . i love the artwork and outstanding maps that accompany the articles . and , `` america 's civil war '' is all about pleasing the readers . back in 1997 i mailed in a questionnaire from `` america 's civil war '' after writing that my favorite issue had a great article on the famous irish brigade . a few months later a new article on the irish brigade ( by the very same author ) appeared in their magazine and i was very impressed by this . bottom line : if you are a civil war buff this magazine is just what you need
1	i have been very pleased with family handyman since receiving my first copy . the featured articles are particularly well done . i especially like how each project they present is well photographed and labeled . if you want a monthly installment of ideas and guidance that will really help you learn and execute some great home improvement projects give family handyman a try
1	as with any profession or avocation or just down right fun habit , it is only as good as the tools you use . this magazine helps you keep up with the latest in the knitting world while still offering traditional patterns and methods . there are lots of glossy shots of fibers and models with well defined patterns and suggestions . you can find many great ads and reviews of other reading material .
1	to the defunct and much missed armchair detective magazine . comparisons aside , strand is the best of a large group that range from glossy to fanzines newsletters covering the mystery genre . very enjoyable ! ! and do n't sell some of them short either ! john row in1ea
1	i have not yet received my issue of creating keepsakes . i have viewed previous issues at stores and have enjoyed all the creative ideas and layouts .
1	muse is one of my all-time favorite magazines . i 'm 15 ( which is above the recommended age ) and i still enjoy it . one of my favorite activities is learning and my other favorite is reading . with muse i can do both at once . what more could i ask ? i do n't know what that midwest educator is on , but i recommend you stay away from it , kids . it ca n't be good for you if it turns you against muse
0	i trashed the issue when i saw the shot of trashy paris hilton . there is enough nudity already in your publication and seeing that sad piece of work ( her ) on the cover just turned me off completely . sorry you thought her 'cover worthy ' . probably missed some fine articles . sincerely : deane everett
1	`` discipleship journal '' does what many other christian magazines do not do . it provides instruction , and challenges the reader to be directly and fully engaged in a christ-focused faith . while others may talk about christianity , dj asks you to pursue christ through responding to scripture . this is n't an evangelistic magazine , like `` decision , '' or an encouraging magazine , per se , like `` moody . '' it is for the christian looking to grow in his or her faith by examining themselves and what god 's word says . it is not for the passive pew sitter . this for the christian who wants his or her faith to impact the days between sundays . there is nothing watered-down here . it is published by navpress , who , like their counterparts , the college ministry navigators , know the crucial necessity of biblical study by the everyday christian . whether it is a discussion about satan 's favorite lies , how to study a particular book of the bible , or an explanation of what prayer is an is not , dj is the sort of publication that will cause you to pause mid-page and realize something new about our lord and his ways . this is a great tool for two or three people to use together . even a small group ... to go through the articles , week by week and discuss them and what this means in real life . i 've even heard of ccd and sunday school classes asking everyone to read selections from a certain issue as fodder for the next week 's class . i fully recommend `` discipleship journal . '' expect your faith to grow . anthony trendl editor , hungarianbookstore.co

1	i personally have always enjoyed reading time magazine long before i became politically aware . i started reading this magazine since i was in my adolescence.do i think it is liberal biased as some of the other reviewers claims that it is ? i do n't know and i do n't care . i do n't read it from a particular point of view . some of the cover stories in the past may be highly questionable given how shallow they might be but i do n't take it personally . one of the best articles i have read in a long time is the issue on high school drop outs . i thought that was quite thought provoking . i did n't think much of the 100 most influential people in the world list . katie couric ? ! c'mon . that woman is to hard journalism as paris hilton is to music . i wo n't even get into rachel ray . if people think time magazine is too liberal , then go read the national review . i do n't see time as hard journalism . half the stuff they publish is fluff pieces .
1	this is one of my favorite magazines , and the only magazine subscription i 've ever given as a gift . my list of recipients should tell you a lot about for whom this magazine is appropriate . i 've gifted the floss to my 73-year-old retired grandma , my 23-year-old writer sister , my 40-year-old trivia buff co-worker , and my 15-year-old high school sophomore cousin . you might call me lazy for using one gift to knock off a good portion of my christmas list , and you 're probably right . but there 's something in mental floss for everybody . i pick up a half-dozen conversational nuggets each month . i probably subscribe to 10 mags , and i 'd say this is the one i actually read every month . great stuff . my highest recommendation .
0	great for filling the doctors office magazine selection - if it 's free - but not worth your money to own . i bought if for gardening inspiration and there is really nothing about gardens or gardening in here . oh , once in a while they remember to put a garden shot in the magazine , but not consistently . the home section is n't that inspirational either . go for it if it 's free , but if it 's not , do n't buy it
1	this is not my favorite fitness magazine . this is the size of a reader 's digest , but is packed with ads just like a beauty magazine . i find this a bit disappointing considering the breadth of information they tend to cover . they share reasonable and attainable goals , and suggestions for us normal people . the magazine seems to cover a wide age group , with information that is good for both young and old . they do offer recipes , workout suggestions , and much more . the magazine takes little time to read , and seems to only serve as a springboard for more follow up on topics you enjoy . i think this is a better magazine to browse through at the supermarket than to purchase
1	five `` big apple '' stars ! ! new york magazine is a mind trip to new york city that anyone can take by sitting down for a brisk read of about an hour anywhere in the world . but it 'll take much longer to digest the detailed topical sections in the back portion of the magazine . and it covers everything : from a throughly researched , interesting , and eye-catching cover article , to departments that cover movies , the latest broadway play reviews , the night clubs , and a restaurant and club section 'that goes on and on ' . i can literally plan forays into the 'big apple ' using this magazine , from the latest trendy hotel , the latest 'unique ' meal in an established or a new reataurant , the newest on or off broadway play , art movie houses showing great independent movies that you probably wo n't find anywhere else in the us outside of los angeles , what artist is appearing at what jazz or rock club and the times of the shows , `` cover '' or `` no cover '' , etc , etc , etc . and yes , tons of glitzy ads . it 's just a `` new york state of mind '' in a magazine that you can use to plan a physical trip or just mentally take the trip . and it will keep you up to date on the current issues in the city . new york magazine sets the standard for all of those other city and state magazines . i love new york city and i love new york magazine . five big stars !
0	i would like to rate this magazine with at least a good rating but that is not possible since i have never received my subscription . i have waited over 4 months since i first paid . i have called and was told i would get a call back telling me when i could expect to start getting it but never did get the call nor the magazine . that was 4 weeks ago . if you want to find out about this magazine go somewhere else . it is not here and no telling if it will ever be here
1	i like getting good stuf in the mail and one day i received this mag from my grandma and i really enjoyed it , seeing as i had just enter hi skool and there we tons of things i wasnt real sure on ... however my mom discontinued it , saying i was too young for it ... many reviewers say this , so i will say what many of them fail to specify : this magazine is geared more for girls who have entered the high-school , teenager period , and deals alot with makeup and boys , a bit of fashion , and keeping close to your friends . i will take a stab at saying its mostly for teens , if not for the younger ones , ages 15 and up ... but realy , dating and makeup are things a girls will decide on when shes ready ... i have neither dated , nor wore makeup , and im an older girl , and the only reason i am more interested in boys and trying to put on eyeshadow is age-curiousity ... the mag has not affected me in any way ... except provide a few hours worth of reading and quiz-taking , plus help on everyday worries ( ie , body , social probs , and so forth ) great mag if you know you have a mature daughter who doesnt change overnite to please people at skool ... age isnt the real big issue if u are maturer ( 15 and up , or have just matured 5x faster than most girls ur age ) and want a mag that is more real life than just made up stories ( they have a fiction section ) , more diverse girls ( all kinds of body types and ethnicities ) , and all around more mature theme , pick up seventeen ... its a great mag , but parents beware ... is talks about sex and has real life stories that can be very disturbing ... just to warn u ... my rents didnt realy like it , but if ur well rounded and have good morals , u realy need not worry ... see y
1	i am not a big magazine reader -- never have been , never really had time to ! however , a friend of mine at work kept bringing me copies of this magazine to read ... after falling in love every time read it i finally i had to get a subscription of my own ! this magazine covers everything ! it 's got tips for life , cooking , decorating , organzing , and getting the best deal for your money . a lot of the stuff in here -- shortcut cooking ideas , for instance , are stuff that i use and apply to my normal life . for example : the july 2006 issue has a dessert shortcut for peach cobbler . the result of that recipe was a wonderful dessert for my family of four that took me ... less than 15 minutes to prepare and tasted great ! they do n't endorse products nearly to the same degree that most magazines do , and when they do it 's in an article where they had comparisons done ... always a recommendation , and usually more than one . the important thing here is they do n't say `` buy this product '' they say `` buy products that have such and such feature , make sure it has this in it for silky smooth hair , and oh here 's an example of what we 're talking about . '' they make you an informed shopper instead of just throwing products at you withotu reason or rhyme . so , in conclusion , if you 're like me and can use a few extra ideas about everything in your life ... this is a great magazine . the information is helpful , applicable to normal everyday life ... and it 's not so full of ads that you want to choke the advertisers
1	overall , this is the best gaming magazine i have read . it covers all consoles , gives sensible ( and funny ) reviews , and previews the hottest upcomming games . most games are reviewed by two people , adding to the accuracy of the score . it has a rating of 1-10 , 10 being the best , a rating which precious few games recieve . the previews section gives you a sneek peek of upcomming games . some of them are one page long , some ten . they all include pictures , and most have an estimated release date . also , there is a section on news in the game industry . ususlly near the beginning of the magazine , they include news on developers , consoles , and the big names in the industry . all in all , this is a great magazine , and well worth your money , because each issue is well over 100 pages
0	i got this magazine as a gift , starting a few months back . i really ca n't say i 'm impressed . admittedly , i 'm much more left leaning than this conservative ( sometimes very , very conservative ) magazine . dispite my bias , i can still recognize good writing and well made points - this magazine generally lacks both . this is n't to say that i 've never seen a good point or anything , they 're just fairly rare . if you want to read a well-written , well-argued , conservative mag this is n't it
0	this magazine used to be very thorough , and it used to be very good at providing me with tons of deals and tips that i never would have found on my own . it was great , and very opinionated . but last year sometime , they changed the look of it and now there 's a lot less text . it 's much more a style magazine now , and that 's not what i want in a travel magazine that i have bought to tell me about money saving ! worse , except for the 40 best vacation bargains , which are still okay , most of the articles forget to incluce a lot of money-saving tips and instead they too often suggest i do expensive things . since when is a $ 225 a night hotel considered budget ? ? the headlines and captions are expecially smart-aalecky . it 's not as good with the expert advice as it used to be ! i noticed that arthur frommer is n't editing it anymore which maybe is why -- bring him back ! my search for a true money-saving travel magazine has unfortunately resumed again
0	as someone who is very interested in healthy eating and living , i was actually appalled by this magazine . it is ostensibly health conscious , but upon closer examination it ignores important health information . for example , in one issue , it had a whole article about diabetes and how , thanks to the miracles of science , diabetics can now eat sugary foods . it proceeded to give a table of artificial sweeteners explaining when to use which . a truly health conscious person would know that aspartame is suspected of causing cancer , and that the only real way to avoid diabetes is to only include a reaonable and moderate amount of sugar in your diet . i was disappointed with the magazine
1	i love this magazine great travel ideas , and fun to read even if you never make the trip ! a recent issue on the yucatan really helped make our vacation there so much more interesting . we visted ruin sites we would have never seen other wise . this magazine and `` tourist in the yucatan '' ( thriller/adventure ) really made my vacation special
0	i just cancelled my subscription and recommended that my daughter cancel the one i bought for my 14 year-old grandson . for some reason ziff-davis marketers think that full page ads selling sex videos are appropiate for pc magazine . ( dec 27 , 2005 , p 122 if you want to check it out ) . previous issues had partial page ads selling `` sex pheremones '' which i could almost overlook , but full pages scantily clad lap dancers is over the line .
1	i was a loyal reader for many years , and i 've always been very impressed by their insightful , deep investigations into various scandals and national political events . they _always_ knew more than the newspapers . they 've been just excellent , very well-written , and i always felt like they could back up their opinions and their open and earnest political biases right to the 6th level of abstraction , so to speak . their pursuit of the objective truth , whether their target has been bush or the dnc , has earned my respect . the new republic kept investigating and muckracking while over the last decade major news institutions have one by one become purveyors of infotainment and pre-digested pablum . my sense is that with media consolidation and various new press liability laws , news sources have become air-tight and we 've been getting our news from company pr flacks and lobbyist firms with agendas . in this environment the real investigative work becomes like gold . middle-brow types read time , but the writers at time and others who want real knowledge and context on what is happening on the ground all read the new republic . the magazine has been vastly more influential than it 's 100k+ circulation # 's would imply . but..the new republic was _for_ the war in iraq , despite their natural antipathy towards bush , which i share . i have n't read them lately - i 'm sure they 're appalled at how things have gone over there . the magazine has never been a cluster of soft peaceniks usually associated with the left , but here i feel like they 've let loose their inner hawks given bush the benefit of the doubt ( always the _wrong_ decision ) .. so what does that make them..quasi-neocons ? utopians ? dupes ? they 're often much too closely focused on israel , and this also may have clouded their thinking ..along with colin powell 's great song-and-dance at the u.n. last year . i felt i needed to try something new . lately i 've been reading the new yorker reason ( it 's right-of-center doppelganger ) some other magazines , but i still think the new republic is an excellent source of news and very worthwhile . definately - you should buy an issue on the news stand try it out
0	i am a low income disabled person and require copious amounts of bathroom reading material , 'wired ' is even too tedious to fill that need . its sponsors tend to run the lengthy ads reminiscent of old picture filled national geographics of questionable scientific value . on the other hand the articles , for example in the latest issue , 'are higher gas prices good for us ' ( paraphrase of title ) offer little information and if i had time to do the research this one is particularly like a sheaf of 1970 nixon press releases in conjunction with the announced operation independance . the intention at the time was to free the u.s. from dependance on foriegn oil . oh we of short memory , condemned to sacrifice our sons and now daughters ! of interest may be the dumb means by which i obtained an unending subscription to this and some other almost as pointless magazines , playstation magazine - now x box magazine , the completely amoral men 's health , garden club , cooking . i simply check the highest income level on every form i fill out on the internet and everything else short of a tax form or loan application . typical of something recieved for nothing wired is not a publication for which i would recommend laying out any money or time . including bathroom time .
0	this magazine is great just for keeping the spirit . it 's filled with many success stories . but hardly any of those success stories include the details that led them into success . it 's also extremely geared towards franchising . every other article , and every other ad is about franchising . i have a one year subscription and at this point i 'm bored . i 'll keep the subscription , but it 's highly unlikely that i will renew next year . *** though one should check out their web site at entrepreneur.com . you will find that it is the total opposite of the magazine , and will prove to be a great wealth of information
0	look at the price of this magazine ! over $ 30 for 6 magazines ! i once read one of these magazines at the library and i hated it ! there were no articles about celebrities , tv , music , or beauty . there were some good advice questions in this , but it did n't give any advice for them ! it said , `` find the answers to these questions in the next issue of new moon . '' also , in the mail bag , someone wrote , `` why did n't you put martin luther king day on your calendar ? '' they wrote back , `` sorry , this magazine is only about girls and women . '' this magazine is really anti-male and disses girls that act like normal teenagers . if you want to get a good magazine , try girls life for almost half the price that new moon is
0	this magazine is not for the average car buyer . they might as well call this the robb report . they only test highend cars and the `` best '' ones are the ones that go 0-60mph the quickest , not ride nice or get good mpg
1	i was on vacation in miami last december and picked-up a copy of this magazine-bw.it is the best photographic magazine i have ever seen or read.it is the best tribute to black and white photography as an art form . the prinitng quality is equally as superb and highly compliments the new technology in printing.it gives new meaning to the words photo finish . unfortunately the magazine is only avaliable in the united states so i have had to subscribe using my son 's address in miami . it has inspired me to further improve my work as an artist , photographer , who considers black and white photography as the only true art form and dismisses digital photography as not being photography . norris hall , belmopan , belize , central america
0	( i sent the following letter to their customer service last week ) after about 15 years of getting your magazine , i have decided not to renew my subscription . it is a shame that your once great publication has become such a joke . after receiving your november issue , and spending 10 minutes removing all the inserts and gimmick ads so i could actually read it , i found no substance . instead there is a fashion section ( yikes ) , a `hot list ' with young barely dressed men and women ( hey i 'm not against a little sex and skin , but i 'll subscribe to vogue or maxim for that ) , an article about larry david 's wife that might as well have come from people magazine , an aussie travelogue that i am convinced their tourist board paid for , all sandwiched in between so many ads for monster suvs and other crap that you need a compass and a map just to keep up with where the articles worth reading continue from one page to the next . what happened to the great writers like krakauer ? what happened to having any environmental conscience ? where are the stories of adventure that are real and make you want to go there ? maybe i am just getting older than your current demographic . i have n't lost my sense of adventure , which is why i live in durango co and spend a lot of time outdoors . i used to look to your magazine for inspiration . now i half expect the cover to tout stories on `killer abs ' . you 've become the clear channel of the outdoor magazine world . get real again and i may come back
0	i ordered kiplingers and us news on march 25 and was immediately charged for both subscriptions . today is october 12th and i 've never received us news . i 've complained several times and been given a variety of excuses and promised a refund and free subsciption which of course i have n't received . when i requested a refund of course i was given the wrong amount . if you want to order magazines i agree with the last reviewer go to another site because while amazon is great for books that have n't got the magazine business straight . also , the customer service phone numbers are wrong and this is a total mess .
1	harper 's is easily my second favorite fashion magazine , second only to instyle . it is great and packed with great fashion . it actually does have some good articles too that i thoroughly enjoy reading . ( the articles are much better than the ones in elle . ) if you can only get one sub , get instyle . if you can get two , get instyle and harper 's bazaar . it is well-worth the money
1	the smartest , best-informed , and most , well , entertaining writing about entertainment and popular culture . i read it cover to cove
1	i highly recommend highlights for children . it 's a great way for children to begin reading in a very fun way . watch your child 's eyes read with delight as they have fun with puzzles , hidden pictures , games , and fun and entertaining stories . cynthia marie rizzo , author of julie and the unicorn
0	once upon a time this was a good magazine worth reading cover to cover . unfortunately they 've slowly been replacing content with more and more advertising . as the magazine currently stands you could probably finish reading the actual `` content '' in about an hour . the rest is advertising and bs . this magazine jumped the shark a long long time ago . just let it die already like it 's supposed to
1	this is an excellent magazine . my young son has been recieving this magazine and has enjoyed it every month . it provides factual information in an interesting format . it has lovely pictures . there are stories , crafts and games that all teach about one main theme with the over lapping idea being all about nature . it is educational and yet it is not boring or overwhelming wtih facts and figures . it is great for the age 7-10 crowd .
1	no doubt , wired is one of the best tech magazines in print , but the subscription for wired for amazon is apparently managed by a company called synapse . i subscribed for a year 's subscription in july and my first issue did not turn up even by mid november . i had to call and cancel my subscription . i now subscribe directly
1	it 's true that entrepreneur mag is loaded with ads -- but those ads can be interesting in themselves . i always find it fascinating to see what ads pop and what ads are junk -- and it 's easy to see the difference . this is an opportunity to develop your own advertising strategy ! as for the content , there is certainly room for improvement . i personally enjoy the entrepreneur profiles , though i wish they were longer . i would like to see more meat here . having been in business for several years now , i find the most value in this magazine comes from the front section where they list interesting tips , new products , and survey results . not a month goes by that i do n't bookmark a page so i can follow up on a new product or check out a website mentioned in a short piece . for that alone , the low subscription price is worth the investment . there is a lot of information on franchising , which is great for those interested in this business model . though this is not my personal cup of tea , i still find it interesting to read the lists of franchises and notice the trends in popularity . who knew there were so many pet service franchises available ! sure , it could use more real-world advice , but i still consider this one of the best general magazines available for entrepreneurs . not every topic can appeal to every reader since we all run different kinds of businesses and seek different information . if you 're looking for something more specific to your industry , a trade magazine would make more sense . but i still recommend you keep your entrepreneur mag too so you can keep an eye on the climate of the small biz world .
1	this magazine single-handedly taught me how to dress with style- and believe me- that 's no small feat . i love how lucky shows how to put pieces together to look fabulous without mindlessly following the crowd . if that 's all i had interest in , then i could 've simply bought the lucky shopping guide book . but their reviews of up and coming clothing and jewelry designers , hair , makeup , home decor , and the `` how i 'm wired '' sections keep me coming back to the magazine . plus the lucky breaks are awesome . my only complaint is the average price of their featured raved-about items . what lucky is for me is a fantastic template for fashion and style that i can use to find similar items at cheaper prices in stores like h , target , etc . it 's so worth the $ 12/year , and i look anxiously at the beginning of each month for its arrival in my mailbox
0	articles were n't anything new . mostly fluff and cosmetic/clothes ads . better info and exercises in oxygen and women 's m
1	this is one of the many different magazines that you can find at discount or grocery stores with lots of hairstyle pictures . this particular magazine is about 60 % color pictures . at least the issues i 've bought were . this is something you would buy if you wanted a new hairstyle that would involve a new cut . a majority of the styles in these magazines are shoulder length styles and above . this is a nice item to have in a hair salon for clients to get ideas while they wait . since this magazine is pictures of celebrities you can also use it to keep track of their hairstyle changes
0	after 1 month i have n't receive the product . it 's to give a good review until it arrives
1	my wife brought a copy of strand home yesterday . the editorial and production quality look excellent . the personality interview , scholarly article and the short stories are very good . i plan to subscribe
1	most of the beautiful gardens i see are in washington or oregon or back east somewhere . having lived in washington , i do enjoy seeing some of the plants that i am missing here in colorado , but it would be nice to see a more varied selction of gardens becasue we all ca n't live in the pacific northwest . i have a subscription to sunset so i guess that will have to suffice , but i do wish bh would take that into consideration . otherwise , i love this magazine . i used to get several magazines , but this was always my favorite . it is chock full of ideas that we can really use . and i love the photography . what sets bh apart is that you can see a hint of life in these beautiful houses . slippers on the floor , newspaper on the table and often the owners of the home are in the pictures too . they are sometimes blurred from movement which is actually nicer than a posed shot . it helps set the feeling that this home is lived in and is attainable . i would say get this magazine right away . i would have given it 5 stars except for the whole garden thing .
0	disney , just about the worst company on earth , has many lines of magazines . this is just used to suck even more money , even though they already have so much money that they 're kids drown to death in money . then disney goes on to cancel dave the barbarian and teacher 's pet , the only good disney shows
1	the high price is predominately due to the shipping costs as this magazine is produced in the united kingdom . a subscription over there runs about twenty bucks . however , even with the added expense to get this delivered stateside , icreate is a great looking magazine with excellent editorials . top-notch magazine and highly recommended . just wish imagine publishing would recognize the potential of this product and start producing this , as-well-as a few other of their excellent magazines , here in the states
0	let me first say i am one of martha stewart 's biggest fans ! i have enjoyed msl magazine for years and loved the format of the `` old '' show ( the new one is taking awhile to get used to ) . i jumped at body and soul when it first came out , but have been repeatedly disappointed in the obvious exclusion of anything `` male '' in the articles . not to mention , the articles on relationships and love have never mentioned same sex partners which i find totally unacceptable , unforgivable , and just plain stupid from a marketing standpoint . why exclude men and gay people ? i have also noticed there are no ads from advertisers marketing to men either . most if not all of the articles are nothing more than `` new age '' pablum , either `` borrowed '' or stolen from much better magazines such as alternative medicine . do n't waste your time or money on this one . this is n't even good enough to line my cat 's litter box
1	i have been a subscriber to family fun for 4+ years and i have always enjoyed the magazine . i do n't remember ever being disappointed in an issue . i usually will read a magazine once just for entertainment value and then go back later and sort out the articles ideas i want to keep on file for future reference . in most magazines this equates to a few pages to hang on to at the most . with family fun i always end up with a huge stack of ideas that i want to hang on to . what is even better is that these are tips and bits of information that i actually use and apply in our everyday lives . practical , useful and fun are all words i would use to describe this publication . my favorite features include : `` my great idea '' - submitted by readers `` family almanac '' - seasonal activities and resources and the travel ideas . we have discovered many great places that our on our list to visit someday and we have even been able to add some wonderful and educational fun to trips we have already had planned . some reviews have complained about the magazine being owned by disney . i 'm not sure why that is such a problem , but i do realize some people do n't like disney . the truth is that some major corporation owns just about everything major magazine out there anyway . at least the disney company has helped family fun gain a bigger audience and provided a fantastic web site as a resource companion to the magazine . i do n't find that disney is overly promoted ( a rarity in the world of disney i know ! ) in this magazine . there are plenty of reviews and references to very non-disney products such as the harry potter series , shrek movies , and hundreds of travel ideas that have nothing to do with anything related to a disney enterprise . this magazine has definitely earned the 5 star rating
0	this magazine shows the negative side of black men . i find the magazine an embarrasement to the african-american community . it seems out of all the races of men in the world , black men seem to want to display their lack of self control , their love of fancy cars , overpriced clothes , which in no way helps create wealth in our communities . and i am also offended that this magazine rarely shows black women on the front cover . until , black men understand that this kind of pathetic display of supposed masculinity is stopped , they will always be stopped by the police , be passed over for employment , and looked down upon . i wish someone would create a magazine for black men which shows the positive side of being a black man such as being leaders in their community , showing respect and love for their women , and showing that everything is not hip hip !
0	the heft and page quality of this magazine is impressive , but it 's mostly advertising . very disappointing . it does have some useful info and i do enjoy reading it ( which is why it got 2 stars from me ) , but i definitely wo n't be renewing my subscription
0	on the whole , bicycling is a huge disappointment . i agree with some writers that the occassional tidbits of information are good , but i do n't pay for a subscription for a sidebar or two -- i read those in the newstand . further , as i will mention below , once and a while there is a real gem of an article . in the meantime , almost everything else they do is poor . the entire magazine is pitched at the readership as though we were all budding pros , training obsessively and fighting with that last 1 % of body fat . the reality is , what bicycling 's readership principally is is rich -- in their own pages , they recently listed average household income of a subscription at $ 115,000 . so it 's not people with the ability tor ride like the pros ride , it 's people with the ability to buy what the pros ride . the result is a majority of articles and reviews that focus on just this -- $ 3000+ bikes ( and , as one reviewer said , the occassional review of more reasonably priced choices around $ 1500 . wait , $ 1500 is *not* chump change ? ! ? ! ) , advanced training and eating techniques , etc. , as opposed to real world riding -- centuries and club rides , touring , commuting ( gasp ! ) , etc . even it 's racing coverage is terrible -- its recent spread on the san fran gp , one of the three most important races in the us , was 6 pages of photos , 4 of which were of people watching the race , not the racing itself . for me , though , the worst part is its hypocrisy . in a recent issue , there was a truly excellent article on what the author called `` invisible riders '' -- low income laborers who depended on their cheap bicycles to get them to and from work sites everyday . yet : the author mentioned several times ( albeit with embarrassment ) that he was riding a seven while doing research on people whose lives depended on $ 100 bikes ; the author commented on the significance of these riders commuting everyday , a movement which riders like bicycling readers had never been able to mobilize ( maybe because they all drive to work and the magazine does little or nothing to encourage bicycle commuting ) ; and the five bikes reviewed in that issue ranged from $ 3500- $ 7000 . really , really sad . one star for `` invisible riders '' and the like , and that 's it
1	for $ 10 a year , at least i can look at a magazine that is n't dominated by spongebrand squarepants or dora the commercialized explorer and that realizes not every parent thinks the disney princess pastel hegemony is the only way to go for a nursery . will i pay $ 200 for a sweater ? very doubtful , but if i did it would be something i could pass down as an heirloom . true , i may spend more per item on my daughter 's clothes and toys than most , but i also limit the number of things she does receive . i 'd rather spend $ 100 on one unique toy i found in cookie than give her twenty pieces of plastic at $ 5 a pop from some toy megapolis . cookie covers quality over quantity , style over branding , modern over mainstream and for that i 'm grateful
0	although i found the magazine itself to be interesting and colorful , with a good series of articles on marriage and relationships , i found that customer service was very dissapointing . i missed an issue back in october , and have contacted customer service 3 times to have them resend the issue i missed . it is now march , and i still have n't received my replacement . just a heads up !
0	do not ! ! order from this website ! i purchased a subscription for oxygen magazine on jan. 30 , 2006 , and i still have not received the first issue . i am very dissapointed , to say the least !
1	men 's health is one of the most popular men 's magazines because it meets the various expectations and needs of the modern man . you simply have to know about fitness , dieting , supplements , fashion , gadgets , etc . the annual subscription makes it a bargain and you get so much information for a few bucks . one of the most interesting sections is the one dedicated to bedroom activities . the tips are definitely useful and yet i highly recommend in addition the bestseller `` scientifically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex '' for the latest secrets in this area . another key feature of the magazine is that it motivates you to stay healthy , lean and fit . there are weight loss tips , advice on how to eat and exercise in order to see results fast . this is important part of keeping sharp appearance . overall , i can reasonably say that you will learn a lot , have fun reading it and most probably it will help you up to a certain limit to be a good looking man and great lover .
0	this is definitely the inferior rag of the big trio of science monthlies . filled with poorly-written articles . i actually went back to home depot once to get a refund for this magazine . it is indeed worth the gas and time to get a refund if you actually pay for this magazine . this magazine promotes commercial products , and no i 'm not talking about the advertisements , but the actual articles themselves . the magazine is not a news magazine , it is just one big advertising rag where manufacturers have paid to get in . if you like paying for ads , go for it
1	there 's a lot to like about lenswork - the selection of images , the quality of the printing , bill jay 's `` end notes '' - but the thing i like the most is that there is almost no discussion of equipment . brooks jensen ( the editor/publisher ) does n't appear to care what camera you used to make a photograph , or how many miles through a raging blizzard you hiked to make it . all that matters is the image . and after you 've finished looking at the images , you 'll find a lot of wisdom and practical information packed into each issue , too . highly recommended
0	time magazine named george bush as person of the year , despite the economic , international and ecological damage he has done and will continue to do over the next four years . speak and be heard . cancel your subscription .
1	i love this magazine ! it has up to the minute , need to know celeb news . honestly most of the time what they say in these `` tabloid '' magazines turns out to be true- jessica simpson split , and brad and angelina , jen and vince , just to name a few ... .also there 's movie/dvd/music reviews , makeup and fashion tips , and the clothes they have in there are affordable so you can dress like your favorite celeb . i look forward to each week getting this magazine
0	this magazine was given to us as a gift subscription when our son was born , but both my wife and i quickly tired of it . the previous review that pointed out their lack of scientific research in a good bulk of their advice and their tendency to misquote and distort studies is just plain irresponsible . the magazine seems to be firmly stuck in a fantasy 'pc ' world of lofty goals and ideals for your children that have very little real world application . articles about disciplining your children that read along the lines of 'if your 2 year old hits his brothe rin the face with a soccer ball , look him straight in the face , make eye contact and tell him that it is not nice to hit ' . thanks for that pearl of wisdom . anyone with a 2 year old can atest to the futility of reasoning with them . never would parents magazine advocate something that might actually work like say taking all of his toys away and marching his butt to the corner where he gets to stand for say 9 years or until he is adopted by the neighbors : ) seriously , the magazine writes for a fantasy land scenario where june and ward are the parents and the kids act like the munchkins on a disney tv movie . if you happen to be the cleavers , go for it..
0	i used to enjoyed discover , but the past several months of their radicals changes , got me to think a real dumbing down.once in awhile , they would put together a good article - but not constantly.how can we enlighten ourselves and improve our intelligence on science etc in the world stage.there are still many of us that do not want to be glued to the computer for science as we would for the tv.discover 's editorial staff ought to get their magazine back on track or the circulation and subscriber base is going to go down the tube . thank goodness scientific american , astronomy , sky and telescope , science news havent fallen down.i am not renewing my subscription unless discover 'rediscovers ' itself.how dumb americans are !
0	when i first heard there was an american version of l'uomo vouge i was really excited . i thought `` finally an american men 's fashion magazine that 'll be edgy , risky , creative original ! '' i could n't have been more wrong . this magazine is virtually indistinguishable from lackluster men 's magazines gq , esquire details . european men 's fashion magazines are works of art with cutting edge photography , bold reporting beautiful advertising . you wo n't find any of this in men 's vouge . the editors of this magazine have greatly insulted the intelligence of american readers . if i could i 'd give this magazine a negative 5
1	great conservative political journalism . would 've liked to read it when william buckley was editor
0	i wish that when i purchased this subscription i would have read all of the reviews . unlike the description included on the amazon website , the subsription does not include the cd-rom , which costs an additional $ 1/issue . and , if you want to purchase the cd-roms for past issues , they cost $ 4/disk . sometimes a bargain is n't really a bargain . buyer beware
0	i ordered the magazine and immediately received my first issue , but unfortunately over the course of the year i only received a total of three issues ! the magazine is great , but i wonder what the problem is . i have no received much help from amazon or modern bride . guess i learned my lesson not to subscribe online anymore .
1	i 've been subscribing to plusa since 1984 , the same year i started powerlifting . it contains a wealth of information for the beginner to the elite lifter . interesting strength articles , interviews with the champions of the sport , results from meets , and the list of upcoming contests . it also contains all the different powerlifting vendors for your equipment needs . its a must to have this magazine for anyone into or starting out with powerlifting . its the original mag
0	i am also a longtime subscriber , and i am quite outraged at the new changes that have been made with the magazine . i have written a letter to the editor containing my list of grievances , if you will ( i would hope they would be redressed but they will probably ignore me ) . anyway , please read : i am a current subscriber , and was quite suprised by discover 's new look ( to all reading this review on amazon.com : amazon.com does not display the updated version of what discover currently looks like ) . i did n't quite care for it , but as long as the material stayed the same i was going to be allright with it . unfortunately , the articles in discover have degenerated into `` top 20 things you did n't know about ... '' lists , piles of trivia , some sexual humor and editorializing on recent news . sure , reading about gay astronauts may be a little humorous . is it appropriate for what discover stood for or what i have expected from this magazine ? i would disagree . occasionally there is an intelligent article . the cover story still seems up to par with the stories from the old discover . i really did once enjoy this magazine and it was the most expected item to arrive in my mailbox . i 've kept all my copies from the last five years in the best condition i possibly could because i truly did enjoy reading them , and still do . maybe this new discover is for a `` new generation '' or meant to lure in younger or less mature readers , but i think the change in articles has taken a turn for the worse . i think the ordinary person , the `` lay man '' if you will , would appreciate at least intelligent articles about new , interesting and groundbreaking discoveries in the scientific community . i remember the string theory article ( i forget which issue exactly ) as one of the most well-written articles on that topic.it was very exciting , and most importantly it [ i ] got me interested in the science [ /i ] . i doubt i will ever see anything that good from discover magazine again . i 'd really hate to give up on this magazine : all i ask is for the old discover back .
0	i hate this magazine . i subscribed sight-unseen based on the good reviews , and find the recipes are for food that no one in my house would ever eat ... way too exotic . if you like good ol ' american fare , do n't buy this one
1	science matters . you already know that . you want to stay on top of what 's happening in medicine , space research , earth studies , and more . that 's because you know things like aids , earthquakes , and changing weather patterns all have huge significance to human needs and social policy . but you do n't have the time or the specialized knowledge to plow through piles of academic journals every week , hunting the nuggets that mean the most and translating them into the language of normal , educated reader . you want science news . it 's brief and readable , so you do n't have to dedicate half your week to keeping up with what really matters . it 's weekly , which matters in a world where month-old news is old news . and it 's written so that any concerned citizen can understand the science and the issues . the editors do n't write down to the readers , but they do n't assume specialized education either . intelligent high-schoolers or precocious tween-agers can grasp the important parts of each story , but specialists ( including one university prof i know ) use it to keep up with news outside of their research areas . try a few issues at your local library - you 'll probably find that you 'll want your own . //wiredweir
1	i have read this mag thru and thru , and for some 20 + years now it has continued to be at the top of the crop . it is the most superbly laid out and designed magazine with excellant content , that i have ever seen . to be totally honest , i would much rather read and browse this any day over `` print '' magazine . this is almost like a graphic design book , that just gets published every 2 months where the best designers in the world are given each about 30 pages to just go nuts on . i found it deep in the stacks of the university library one day and have been hooked ever since ... also for those of you who can read/write japanese , german , and english you can have your pick while reading..
0	i have to agree with those who did n't care for it . the only thing i liked was one article written by a dad who was skateboarding with his son . it was witty , insightful and inspirational . the rest of the mag just seemed totally irrelevent to my life . it is aimed at people who dry-clean their childrens clothes . does anyone do that ? i do n't want my kids to be that concerned with clothes and money . the few issues i read made me mad and depressed . i 've never written a review before but felt compelled to do so regarding this lame magazine . give me break with that $ 400 cashmere hoodie for my son ! my son likes his vilified character t-shirts and that is what matters . he is not a reflection of my style , he is a reflection of his own . get over yourselves
1	no doubt , wired is one of the best tech magazines in print , but the subscription for wired for amazon is apparently managed by a company called synapse . i subscribed for a year 's subscription in july and my first issue did not turn up even by mid november . i had to call and cancel my subscription . i now subscribe directly
1	sports illustrated is a great magazine , the premier magazine for sports . the writing in it is spectacular as well as the clear and helpful visuals that go along with every article . to make this short , i highly recommend this a subscription for any sports fan -- it 's a great gift for a husband , boyfriend , or just any sports fan
1	my husband and i started with a free subscription to this magazine and fell in love with it . we both read it from cover to cover
1	after reading a few of the other reviews , i am again baffled by the left/liberal take on things . this is a conservative magazine ! ! liberals , open at your own risk ! you just might encounter a differing view point than you own ! goodness . the articles are informative , indepth , humorous , and thoughtful . it 's a good read .
1	excellent selection of recipes anyone can prepare , in just 30 minutes . no need to be out of ideas for any party or get together , just open the book to any page , and you 're set and ready to go , or should i say cook !
1	we subscribed to this magazine for our 7 year old . our 3 and 5 year olds like it as well . we all enjoy sitting down together to read it as soon as it comes in the mail . i enjoy flipping through it myself . you 're never to old to learn fun facts about nature ! ! a perfect gift
0	two months after ordering the magazine i have yet to receive a single issue
0	psychology today is just another glamour/cosmo/people disguised as a magazine discussing issues in psychology . this magazine used to be well-written and had more scientific data . however , since the appointment of the new editor , headlines became similar to that of tabloid magazines all over . if you are interested in scientific data and research , this is not the magazine for you . i used to subscibe to psychology today but stopped renewing since i took more psychology classes becuase i found out that the magazine had no new insights to offer in the field of psychology at all
0	i have received this magazine from it 's start and have always found it to be full of great recipies , however , the company that produces this magazine has horrible customer service . i have battled with them for over a year about a billing mistake on their part and they still have yet to make it right . i have cancelled all subscriptions with them and refuse to do business with them any longer . if you subscribe be very cautious about ordering any books from them
0	i 'd always heard about interesting articles in this magazine . but the mess of ads and people magazine gossip that lands ( with a big , heavy thud ) on my doorstep every month is the most worthless magazine i 've ever made the mistake of purchasing . it 's pretentious tripe aimed at a small group of nyc media insiders , self-regarding movie celebs , and those people who 'd like to be part of that world . even when they occasionally hit on a compelling subject , the writers are so narcissistic as to be truly repellent . it 'd be more accurate simply to cut `` fair '' out of the title
1	in touch is a weekly glossy magazines that retails at newstands for $ 1.99 . it is very similar to star and us weekly . they offer fodder on the hollywood flavor of the moment , so expect lots of stories about julia roberts , britney spears , brad pitt , jenifer aniston , j.lo and the usual suspects . it is very worth the newstand price . they rarely , if ever have human interest stories , most of the stories are all about celebrities , style , make-up , or fashion . they also have contests some times . a lot of times i notice they run the same stories and pictures as us weekly so if i had to choose between in touch and us weekly 1 year subscription is less i would choose us because it still seems like they get more exclusive stories that in touch . also , some of the news they run sometimes is weeks old , i often think they end up filling space close to print time . it 's an okay magazine an worth the cover price
0	i was gon na make a point , but fabz made it for me i was gon na say that nowadays an cd is considered tight just because it has a couple of hit singles and yayo 's hit singles werent really hits his songs were on the radio tv for probably about a month or two if thats what you call a hit then you crazy the fact is it takes more than 4 good songs to make a good cd he said that there were 4 hot songs on the album but failed to mention that there are 17 songs on the cd a couple of good songs dont make it good cd you want to see what other people think of the yayo album read the reviews for it and jeezy please he always been garbag
0	i can not review this item because a month later , i still have not received the first issue of my subscription . sorry frank caldero
1	vogue fantastic high fashion photos . if you love to look at beautiful clothing and shoes you need to look at vogue . however , as other reviews have indicated , the articles are quite lacking . they are often flat without much substance on topics that are frankly not interesting . so , you get vogue for the pictures . if your looking to ogle pretty clothes or for inspiration for an art project this is a great magazine , if you want something to read get something else
0	i would like to rate this magazine with at least a good rating but that is not possible since i have never received my subscription . i have waited over 4 months since i first paid . i have called and was told i would get a call back telling me when i could expect to start getting it but never did get the call nor the magazine . that was 4 weeks ago . if you want to find out about this magazine go somewhere else . it is not here and no telling if it will ever be here
0	there are very few serious articles in this magazine -- just tons of tidbits ( stats/facts/tips ) . by the time you get to the end it 's difficult to recall anything from the magazine ; it 's that shallow . occasionally there 's a good recipe , but that 's about it
1	this science magazine should be held as a standard for the intelligent general science minded person . articles are good , not overly technical in depth . at times it gets in its doldrums of articles , but generally it holds it own . you do n't have to be a specialist in the field or hold degrees of the same . but it doesnt treat you like you were an idiot . it does at times takes some thought of getting used to . their 'special topic issues ' may be avoided unless you want compendium issue of that topic.well received for the high-schooler either as the magazine or the website . at least the layperson can be science informed . the title of the magazine says it all
1	very interesting with nice pictures . gives a lot of information for travelling all over the world
1	old mac usr , new mac usr , matters not . there is something in this magazine for everyone . and , icreate has a pretty good online usr forum too .
0	a friend of mine got me a subscription to this magazine because i like cooks illustrated . this magazine is nothing but ads for snazzy expensive foods and restaurants . there are so few recipies in it i would n't call it a 'cooking ' magazine . what few recipies they do have do n't explain why they chose the ingredients used or give much detail at all . if you consider yourself a 'foodie ' who likes to go to fancy restaurants and likes to know what 's hip on the latest gourmet food and wine , then this magazine might be for you . if , however , you like to cook and know what you are doing and why you are doing it , try cooks illustrated instead .
1	i love this magazine ! it tells you about every new game that comes out brand new
0	i was going to buy this and then stumbled on it in the doctor 's office . i love instyle , lucky and other shopping mags , but the tone of this is mean and snooty . there are too many ads , and very little content . there 's a q section about sex after baby that 's just mean , threatening that if you do n't jump back in , `` one of you will start sleeping with the girl in marketing ... '' way to put an anti-feminist tone on sex after baby . yuck .
0	i subscribed to this magazine in august and just received the september issue now ! budget travel 's customer service is terrible , i 've complained several times but am still missing the august , october and november issues , have asked for a refund but have yet to have my account credited
0	i 'm not sure why this magazine is so highly rated . sure it 's an o.k . magazine , if you like immersing yourself in hype , marketing-speak and incredibly superficial language . admittedly the pictures are pretty and as an obsessed mountain biker i can say we like bike porn . i just can not read any of the articles . chock full of over-the-top adjectives and 'xtreme ' language . i do n't trust a magazine that calls every new incremental advancement in biking technology 'revolutionary ' or 'amazing ' or any number of disgustingly inappropriate modifiers . they ceaselessly use vapid 'technical ' jargon made up to sound high-minded and high-tech , but is nothing more than marketing spew . the tech advice column is full of suspicious letters that have the stench of stealth advertising . if there 's one thing that 's well thought-out about this magazine , it 's how best to bombard the reader with sales pitches , half-truths and hype . in short , this magazine is blatant industry propaganda . my first advice : do n't buy it . if you do buy it ( for the love of god ) do n't take anything between those covers seriously .
1	i love this magizine and i have read every issue . it has great fitness tips for you whole body . i would definately recomend this magizine to you
1	my husband and i both love to cook , and some of our new favorites come from this magazine . the reviews are informative , the recipes taste great ( and are not overly complicated ) , and the basic cooking suggestions are helpful . the magazine likes to pick a theme for the month ( or several ) which has a couple of benefits . 1 . you can cook a meal right from one issue and it all tastes great together and 2 . you have several options for one basic idea . for example one month there was a whole article on rice pilaff which starting with the basics ( so you could modify the basic recipe your own way ) and then gave several variations . best i have found out there so far
0	not nearly as appealing as the other magazines i have read : motortrend , car and driver , automobile mag , sport compact . i do n't like any of the long racing articles and anything on old cars . car and drivers off topic articles tend to be more interesting and occasionally very funny
1	golf digest is the big daddy of a well-populated family of golf publications . it 's self-styled tag line -- 'the # 1 golf publication ' -- is well-earned . where other weeklies report the golfing *news* , golf digest is a monthly celebration of golf as life , or at least of the golfing life . it 's golf-star-celebrity-packed articles tend to wear titles in the imperative ( 'do n't stretch your wedges ' ) , giving the sense that the golf world is populated by feverish self-improvers . even those of us who are less than bent on links glory , the photography of this publication looks extraordinary . this aspect reaches its zenith during the magazine 's frequent published admirations of the finer courses around the world . no doubt about it , golf digest is a lifestyle magazine as much as anything else . yet the semi- to really-serious golfer will find its pages rich with suggestions on improving his or her game . golf digest anchors the world of english-language golfing publications . even better , you can frequently pick it up for the price of a few frequent flyer miles
1	good housekeeping is a wholesome , clean , serious magazine . various topics that may be found in an issue - how to raise children , household tips , financial help , or marriage advice - suggest that the magazine is geared towards the middle-aged to the older woman . i 'm married and only in my 20s , but i still get so much out of reading the articles and advice anyway . i absolutely love this magazine ! i was looking for a magazine with good , long articles to read , and i found this great one . they even re-designed the look , and it 's excellent . everything is more organized , clearly separated into their respective sections , and each page is clearly marked with the section header so i 'll always know which section i 'm on . i particularly enjoy the articles about real-life triumphs and tragedies , talk to me by joy behar about relationship advice , and peggy post 's etiquette dilemmas
1	this magazine is one of the alltime best mags for men . it has everything you want , including hot babes , cars , gadgets , and sexy bikinis . it is also very cool in that it can turn you on to some cool stuff , like the new watches they showed by fossil and dkny , and some excellent martini recipes , and then they turned me on to a dvd called `` new sex now '' which has greatly enhanced my reputation with the ladies . i , for one , am hooked .
1	of the big 3 ( fortune , forbes , and businessweek ) , i like fortune the most . businessweek feels like it 's always copying someone or dying to jump on the bandwagon for the next big thing . forbes is a good magazine but sometimes is so original that it veers too far from its original purpose -- -to report and analyze the business world . fortune profiles the people it chooses and writes about current events without just summarizing the way businessweek does
1	this newsletter is a great resource for dog people . the articles are well researched , detailed , and best of all , applicable . i keep them in a binder , and often refer back to earlier issues if i have a health or training concern about my dogs ( and have been known to share them with friends . ) both the positive training and the holisitic health information is great . i definitely recommend this newsletter to anyone who loves their dogs .
1	great monthly information on the latest design trends and figures . sadly it only comes 2x 's a year
1	i have been a reader of motor trend for most of my life . i am 50 years of age and since high school art/design classes there has been nothing like motor trend for past , present , and future car , truck , and other motor vehicle design like this publication . ***** j. e. hoove
0	i used to sell and fix macs since the original mac 128 , i have owned 14 macs over 21 years so i have seen it all . mac addict is ok but only because our choices are so slim . mac user was always the best and i could n't bother renewing macworld after they got nasty with my late payment after i bought it for almost 20 years . i quit buying macaddict because of all the free disks . they were full of buggy freebies and ii turned me off . to keep up with macs , read the ny times in the circuits section and david pogue 's column , web site . also . if you can afford the wall st journal , read walt mossberg for all techy things . he gives a fair review and answers any questions he can , mac pc , camera . the wash post on line has a good tech writer for mac stuff.we reallt do n't need a magazine with the web . happy mac-ing and order tiger . i just got my new ipod photo 60 gig and a 1gig shuttle which i use every day in the gym . buy applecare and apple will cover the ( probably ) 2 batteries . i have an original ipod ( 10gig in 01 ) and the battery still works and i abused it on many plane trips . it still runs and is my bedroom pod hooked up to my bose cd/radio . yeah i love toys . roger taylo
0	i thought i detected some deterioration in the quality of discover magazine in recent months , so i went to the web to see if anyone else had the same notion . indeed they have . sad .
0	i got this magazine for a year and a half before i had to quit my subscription recently . i liked all the fashion tips and articles on how to dress for your body size and style , and that is why i subscribed to begin with . but i was not expecting the bombardment of amoral opinions forced on me . ( not to mention an overload of advertising- which you will get in most fashion magazines anyway , so that 's not a complaint ) . sure there was a few lines here and there that were nonbiased ( telling the facts of stds and such ) , but 90 % of the articles on sex , were opinion and not fact . girls today are having sex with anyone and getting hurt emotionally and physically because of magazines like seventeen who say that sex is good if you 're ready ( what 15 year old girl is ready to have sex and get an std or a baby ? ? please . ) , and that condoms are 100 % effective . they are not , but that 's what most teen girls believe because of stupid magazines like this . they need to take advice from their parents and doctors , not magazine articles . i was disgusted at the opinions presented as truth to basically promote teen girls doing whatever they want without consequences .
0	nice cover pictures and headlines , but way too many ads . there 's a reason its only twelve bucks , this is an ad-sponsored mag
0	as you can tell by the title , i 'm not enamored of this magazine . i 've been playing video games since the early 80s , and have read many , many gaming magazines . my reasons for this negative review of gamepro follow in no particular order : 1 . ) their numerical rating system stinks . 1-5 points is just not accurate enough . most mags/web sites have a 1-10 system with decimals . not gamepro . 2 . ) the written part of the reviews are way too short , and often are written borderline incoherantly . it 's as if they hired the proverbial 1,000 monkeys to type them out . 3 . ) often times they cram two or three reviews on one page . screen shots provided with reviews are often the size of a postage stamp . 4 . ) the number of ads in relation to content is distinctly high . once when i was bored , i counted all the ads in one issue . out of around 110 pages there were 60+ pages of ads . 5 . ) their article layouts are confusing , and occasionally they print on colored backgrounds that closely match the text color . forget about reading it if you 're colorblind . 6 . ) their gaming tips are either so obvious that a brain dead chimpanzee could figure them out , or plain do n't work . i suspect that the ones that do are ripped off from various web sites . 7 . ) gamepro costs the same as better gaming mags , such as egm and game informer . so , in closing ... if you want a good gaming magazine , just about any magazine other than gamepro would be an improvement . many great gaming magazines have come and gone , why a turd like gamepro continues is a mystery to me
0	do not buy this magazine ! for any price , it is too expensive . marie claire has harassed me repeatedly to pay for my subscription . it was paid for in advance thru amazon . i have sent them copies of my amazon receipt twice . they are reporting me to a credit agency for non-payment . avoid them , avoid them . they are scam artists and will falsely and with malice destroy your credit rating .
0	it takes too much time to receive the first book . i have n't received the first book yet
1	this magazine has been consistently good for many many years . ca n't live without i
1	this is perhaps my favorite photography magazine . the printing is fantastic as is the subject matter . i really like the fact there are no ads in it at all . so many photography mags are just an extended catalog for b or adorama that this is a breath of fresh air . the photography itself is second to none . always something interesting and fresh
1	it always seems like a holiday when my utne arrives . it has never failed to delight me in my long tenure as a subscriber and fan . nowadays , with so much of our `` news '' actually being political spin and hype , with that forced-fed feeling , it is so refreshing to be able to read interesting , tasty , thoroughly satisfying stuff that is not the run-of-the mill , banal , overly celebrity-focused junk . [ hey , i like celebrities just as much as the next guy , but i like to take a break once-in-a-while . ] utne respects your intelligence . it seems to arrive just on time , every time . the focus here is on improving one 's life and , perhaps , one 's corner of the world ( or just a corner of a room ) . sure , there is a progressive bent to the content ( it used to be dubbed `` the best of the alternative media '' ) : there 's ample pro-environment , pro-organic , pro-diversity , pro-spirituality content here . [ have they made `` progressive '' a dirty word , too ? ? ? ] i find it consistently conducive to recharging my batteries . go for it . you will be amply rewarded . like entering a fresh , new world every two months . you will likely read it from cover-to-cover
0	this overpriced magazine is for the weekend warriors who would like to start a new hobby . there is nothing wrong with this , we all started somewhere . however , one can only stand for so much of new tool ratings and how to build the same old challege-less pieces of furniture . please do n't waste your money . try fine woodworking , woodworking , or even popular woodworking . you will be greatful you did , and will be on the road to becoming an expert weekend warriors
1	i 'm one of those people who always looks up product reviews before buying anything , so it was on a leap of faith that i bought natural health magazine without reading anything about it . a friend suggested it , and since this particular friend has never led me wrong before , i caved in and bought the july/august 2005 copy immediately . let me start off by saying that i 'm an extremely picky person . i have extremely high standards for every purchase i make , and i absolutely will not cut a manufacturer any slack if i find a fault . now that i 've gotten that out of the way , i will mention that i was thoroughly impressed with natural health . long ago , i subscribed to new age magazine ( now known as body soul , which i do not care for ) . it was among my favorites solely due to its wide variety of content and true-to-focus natural lifestyle tips and advice . i can not stand redundancy , incorrect information and excessive advertising . i found that natural health was much more long the lines of the former new age magazine , filled with dozens of little gems that make it worth much more than the $ 3.95 i paid . to give you an idea of what the magazine includes , here is a small sampling of the articles i found in the july/august issue : small articles include : - `` to bee or not to bee '' , a breakdown on aromatherapy ingredients that include bee pollen , royal jelly , propolis , and honey , stating just how effective and natural these ingredients are . - `` how can i get relief from pms ? '' experts ( including a naturopath , gynecologist and dietitian ) answer this question with excellent responses . - `` medicine cabinet : attack of the weekend warrior '' natural remedies and aids for those like myself who love to be weekend warriors . - `` clothes to pose in '' great yoga gear ! - `` medical breakthroughs '' - `` healing supplements : 8 ways to beat anxiety '' - `` fitness fix - knee savers '' longer articles include : - `` healthy appetites : savvy strategies for eating well '' delicious , healthy recipes and tips . - `` good medicine : a clean , healthy mouth '' a well-researched article on `` mercury fillings , fluoride toothpaste and the best at-home remedies '' . - `` five paths to peace '' five simple meditation techniques . - `` eat to beat the heat : yin foods '' more great recipes ! - `` sacred spaces '' - making your home your personal retreat . this is only a sampling ; in fact , that 's less than half of the magazine alone . some articles are fairly short , but provide just the right amount of information to get the point across . my personal favorite was the last page , `` make one change '' , where this month 's change is to `` upgrade your z 's '' . it included simple tips that i was able to implement immediately . the amount of advertising seemed slightly less than usual ( probably about the same amount as you 'd find in a yoga journal , but not nearly as many as in oprah magazine ) , and they seemed to be in line with the natural health focus . judging by the past reviews on natural health , it seems the magazine had a bad run in the 2003-2004 timeframe . let 's remember that magazines change editors frequently . i found none of the past complaints to be true in this issue , but that may not be so in future issues years from now . as for me , i want a subscription asap
1	revolver 's competing magazines in the heavy metal magazine world are hit parader and circus . i have bought all three of these magazines several times , and revolver my final judgement is revolver is the only magazine that is good enough to subscribe to . the other two i still buy occasionally , but only for wallpaper ( i cut out the pictures of bands in the magazines and hang them in my room . ) this magazine is , in a way , like a combination of circus and blender magazines ; it combines the best aspects of both . revolver still has plenty of great pictures , but it is also much longer and much better written than circus . it is not quite as long or stuffed full of information as blender , but make sure you note that revolver only reports on one genre ( heavy metal ! ) whereas blender could ( theoretically ) report on every genre ( rap , pop , rock , etc . ) chances are , if a hard rock band ( especially a big name hard rock band ) is about to or has already released a c.d. , revolver will do a story about it . the stories/reports are very entertaining but they also are informative and sometimes a lesson is learned from them . if it 's a cover story , an interview with the band is also included ; if it 's not a cover story , the writer integrates quotes and answers from the band into the article , anyways ( even though it 's not a formal interview ) . revolver writers frequently go on tour with a band ( i.e . lamb of god ) . in that case , they take the reader backstage , on the tour bus , and in a concert ( with a rundown of the show ) . when i first started reading this magazine , there was a sexual theme to it . there would be a picture of a `` hot babe '' in a t-shirt , and one side of the poster would be a woman-usually half-naked-in a sexual pose . in the past year or so , revolver phased that out ( probably to appeal to a broader audience ) . i sometimes miss the pictures of the `` hot babes , '' but this way there 's more room for real heavy metal pictures . yet , even though sex is n't a theme anymore , revolver is probably a bit too sophisticated for anyone younger than a teenager . plus , there are usually profanities ( mainly the `` f word . '' ) so , i would say this magazine is for ages 13 and up . monthly articles : -cover story -3 or 4 other biggish stories - `` fresh blood '' column ( where a small biography is given on a band you probably have n't heard of ) - ask vinnie ( an column where readers write questions , and pantera/damageplan drummer vinnie paul gives advice ) - hard rock news and notes - black and death metal news and notes - `` in the studio '' ( an update on bands currently recording new music ) -free poster ( in the middle of the magazine , there 's a fold-out poster of one or two bands . ) the poster is n't very wide , but it is about two pages long -free music downloads - '' ink spot '' ( a story about a musician 's favorite tattoo ) - '' favorite sh*t '' ( an interview with a musician , with questions such as `` what 's your favorite color ? '' ) -joke from a band ( revolver has just recently started doing this ) - reviews ( reviews of c.d . 's , music dvd 's , and video games ) pros : -- plenty of good pictures and a free poster -- professionally written with well known writers ( yet it is not too intelligent for teenagers ) -- edited well ( i have n't found any mistakes or typos ) -the `` fresh blood '' column usually introduces me to a band i have n't heard of , but i should probably check out -- revolver is accredited and well known enough to be allowed to go on tours with bands and be first for interviews -- news columns ( on both mainstream and underground metal bands ) -the stories are always done with quotes from the band that the report is on -- free music ! ( revolver has started doing a page that gives the reader a password , which he/she can then access free music downloads online . ) -- no stupid questions in interviews ( they ask up to date questions , and sometimes-i.e . in the interview with puddle of mudd-the writers are n't afraid to ask daring , cutting questions ) -- the `` in the studio '' segment is always informative -- helpful , reliable reviews ( they do n't automatically praise every heavy metal c.d . ) cons : -- if you 're up to date on your music news web sites , the news columns should n't really be anything new to you . -- not all c.d . 's are reviewed ( they give a rundown on the c.d . in the article about the band , but c.d . 's from bands that are on the cover of the magazine are n't usually reviewed . ) -concerts are n't reviewed -my biggest gripe is that it 's only issued once a month . the bottom line is , if you 're a metalhead , this is the best magazine you can get ! it is more than well worth the ten dollars you will spend for a years worth of entertainment
1	organic gardening ( og ) is an excellent gardening reference for gardeners of all skill levels . in addition to hints and tips for growing flowers and vegetables naturally , each og issue is packed with all types of interesting , insightful , and often humorous articles covering a wide range of topics from composting to building a bat house . from farmers to container gardeners , og has something for everyone
1	this magazine is so delightful ! fantastic tutorials-great photos and wonderful info . i enjoy it very much and would n't hesitate to subscribe again . i heartily recommend it
1	if you need to keep abreast of financials and business on a monthly basis , forbes and fortune are the two conventional choices . i started reading fortune - and subscribing - four years ago when i realized that the business people with whom i associated regularly simply assumed that one knew any news or analysis that broke in its pages . it fits as a must-read monthly overview in my reading habits . fortune represents a generally bullish and strongly pro-business perspective with just a touch of cynicism about corporate leadership and its trends . you wo n't find anything radical here , but you need to have read it if this kind of news , analysis , and opinion fits your job description or personal interests . there is a smattering of 'toys for the businessperson ' in each edition . for me , the highlight is stanley bing 's delicious , irreverent , and every so slightly jaded backpage column . i routinely scan it or mail it to a relative who laughs out loud at bing 's corporate lunacy as i do . fortune is behind the eponymous fortune 500 and other derivative lists . for me , one of the most valuable is the magazine 's annual '500 largest corporations by revenue ' , though this is dictated by the scope of my own interests . other readers will tear out or access other fortune lists online with equal interest . if you 're in business or work with people who are , you 'd better be reading fortune or forbes or both
0	i was looking forward to a magazine that took a good look at different subjects than those covered in the mainstream media . what i received was a manual on how to think the `` right '' way . i 've never delved deeply into politically labeling myself , but i vaguely considered myself a liberal . man , was i wrong . clearly , liberal means much the same as the demonized `` conservative '' . this magazine has a single viewpoint , that of an ultraliberal ex-hippie who has found themselves wealthy in the 21st century . it is full of articles about `` finding meaning '' and `` reassessing life '' that seem to have been written by folks who drive chevy suburbans and pay too much for a cup of coffee . the magazine gives off a strong smell of covert superiority , and it made me nauseous
1	i have been subscribing to this mag for a couple years , and think it 's one of the best gaming mags available . i have several different consoles , and appreciate that they review games for all platforms . i like the rating system ( 1-10 ) instead of the too-hard-to-pin-down 1-5 , and find the reviews well written and objective . while i have been gaming for years , i am not necessarily versed in computer lingo , but i never feel like an idiot after reading this mag ; the writing is erudite but very easy to understand . i read several different gaming magazines each month , and feel this magazine strikes exactly the right balance between the more serious and more frivolous gaming magazines in the industry . one suggestion : if you have a gamestop or affiliated store in your neighborhood , get your subscription through them . for about $ 15 you receive a 12-year subscription , and a card that gives you 10 % off used games at these stores , as well as an extra 10 % trade-in value on your used games ( sometimes there will be a coupon in that month 's mag to upgrade to 20 % for both ! ) .
1	this is simply the best woman 's magazine i 've ever read ! and i can say that i 've read a lot of them - both in the us and in germany . i 've read it for over 12 years and i can say that i never got bored with it . i 'm still excited about any new issue . the articles always matter and they catch just the right balance between being serious and entertaining . it 's for the modern young woman . to name a few subjects : career , love , sex , family , style , wellness , travel reports and interviews - every article going a bit deeper than the usual woman 's magazine . there 's really something to read for days . and on a side not : there 's more articles than ads !
0	i subscribed to this magazine in january for my husband . it took 5 months to get the first magazine , then i never recieved another one
1	if you have your own small business or start-up , or are even slightly thinking about starting one , this magazine is well worth the small cost . i usually bring mine on the plane along with a couple others
0	i ordered this mag back in june , now it 's december and i 've yet to receive it . this equals a big fat zero in my book .
0	this magazine is almost as bad as consumer reports . their comparison tests never adhere to their thesis about what the tests is measureing , for example a comparison test is said to be about quick acceleration and on point handling and then the car with the lack lust performance in handling and acceleration would be # 1 in ranking . often , the car reviews are always mentioning information about a car that is n't relevant , or does n't make sense , or the review is n't consistent with the posted viehicle stats . the magazine also seems to be biased . some vehicles are criticized with more irrelevant information than others to say its awful . after further reading of many issues , you would think they are playing favortism towards certain brands or recieving kick backs from manufacturers , for example , you will always see the domestic brand being referred to as basically `` trash '' and a japanese brand or a bmw is always the way to go , when once again the posted stats and sometimes photos say different.this is more noticeable when you can predict the out come of their reviews . ultimately , its a bad guide towards getting any information on automobiles period . its the pat robertson of auto magazines . if it were possible , i woudl n't even give this magazine 1 star .
0	sure i like a mystery- who does n't ? but when you a read a magazine like hitchcock you end up losing faith in the short mystery story . the tales are hard-edged and lacking in style and substance . we seem to have a wealth of mystery writing talent but time and again hitchcock magazine is a disappointment . the value for money is horrible , the magazine is printed on newsprint paper and the ink just needs to be touched to smudge- alfred hitchcock would not be proud
0	awful ! ! ! this is just page after page after page of ads for grotesque jewelry - mostly gaudy watches and necklace sets - and clothing . there were two `` articles '' at the very end of the magazine , and they were awful . one , on christmas in the english countryside , should have been beautiful . instead , it contained just a few pics and very little text . what a disappointment . do n't waste your money . first pick up a copy in the supermarket before you waste money on a subscription . once you see how really ridiculous this magazine full of nothing but ads really is , you wo n't waste your money on a subscription .
0	for ads only pretty much . there is not much to read or learn for the common reader . it seems like it 's mailing for the fashion elite not for everyone .
0	this magazine is chock full of supplement advertisements . advertisements in fashion magazines are annoying , but supplements can be unhealthy and dangerous . these ads may have something to do with the target audience of the magazine ... it seems to be directed to women who are hard core about weightlifting and fitness , to the level of competition . a recent article in the magazine was talking about what percentage of body fat was too low for women . some of the women had body fat below 10 % - i 'm trying to get mine below 30 % . it 's just a different fitness/weightloss league completely . i like magazines like fitness and shape better because it sets more reasonable goals and provides more reasonable advice . i can substitute toast with jam for bagels with cream cheese . i ca n't drink protein shakes for breakfast and lunch , eat 10 servings of protein a day , and pop potentially dangerous pills . i am very disappointed with this magazine..
0	i should preface this reveiw with the fact that i am an accomplished home cook . i have been cooking for 25 years and own more than 500 cookbooks . i do not buy commercially prepared products like breads , crackers , mayonnaise or salad dressings . i make these items myself . i suspect that i am not the target audience for this publication . the may/june 2006 issue is 32 pages in length in total . given that there are only 6 issues a year , i was expecting a little more than a mere 32 pages . the may/june 2006 issue contains the following information : simplifying moroccan chicken bringing home fish and chips grilled tomato salsa grilled london broil main-dish vegetable stir-fries how to cook pasta foolproof veal scaloppini a new twist on chicken salads garlic and olive oil mashed potatoes utimate turtle brownies best strawberry cream cake the scoop on vanilla ice cream a review of tongs if you are an experienced cook their is n't much about cooking in this issue that will be new to you . this issue contained not a single piece of new information for me about cooking . however , i enjoyed the equipment reveiws and did find them informative and useful . this magazine would be helpful if someone is an inexperienced cook . bottom line , i will not be renewing my subscription unless future issues have a little `` more meat '' in their content . i think that this magazine is overpriced for what you receive . i would suggest saving the price of the subscription and buy their `` best of '' cookbook instead . it costs about the same amount , contains many more recipes , has many of their equipment reviews and is bound in a hard cover so that it will hold up longer . additionally , check out an issue of `` fine cooking '' which is another test kitchen type of publication , just with more depth .
1	this magazine is amazing ! ! it keeps getting better and better , unlike all the other sell-out magazines such as muscle fitness . it 's a shame it does n't have more readers ! if you like the mag then pass it around , people work hard to put it together ! a great buy !
1	i saw this magazine while browsing a local bookstore and it was a magazine that stood out for some reason ... i picked it up and flipped through a few pages and came across an article on maggie gyllanhall . i had recently watched `` secretary , '' and i liked her , so i bought it . i 'm not much for fashion magazines but this is much different from others like vogue . after buying my first flaunt magazine , i wanted to buy more , but needless to say , the bookstore has not gotten any in for a long time ... : ( this magazine will be great for readers who are bored with the same crap churned out in every other magazine out there..
1	i have been subscribing to alfred hitchcock 's mystery magazine for many years . i find it an excellent periodical . the genres range from humor , cosies , hard-boiled detectives , to locked room puzzles , with an added dessert of a `` mystery classic '' at the end of every issue , some dating from the 19th century . i especially enjoy the absence of gore . the stories are just the right length to satisfy your `` mystery craving '' before bedtime . another kudo : the ahmm is notably hospitable to aspiring short story mystery authors
0	we received first issue of guitar world and there was no bonus cd-rom . called the magazine and was told that since we purchased the subscription from amazon at $ 19.95 that there would be no monthly cd-rom . they charged us another $ 10 to have the monthly cd-rom added to the subscription for the rest of the issues . but that cd-rom is mentioned in amazon 's editorial review of the magazine . you get the impression that you are getting a deal on this magazine , but you are not because you do n't get the bonus cd-rom . it turns out to be the same rate as if you buy directly from the magazine
0	love to review history today , but have n't seen a copy yet . any ideas
0	i liked time magazine a lot until they named george bush person of the year ? oh my god , where were all the educated editors/writers when they let this moron write this article
0	this was a gift for my daughter . instead of receiving the new yorker , she is receiving people . you need to fix this
1	successfully blended satire , high camp and yet another sexual taboo into a really funny movie . 
0	unlike trey parker , sandler doesn't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself . 
1	the real star of this movie is the score , as in the songs translate well to film , and it's really well directed . 
1	it is different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches ; it primarily relies on character to tell its story . 
1	jackson tries to keep the plates spinning as best he can , but all the bouncing back and forth can't help but become a bit tedious -- even with the breathtaking landscapes and villainous varmints there to distract you from the ricocheting .

0	to build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved .

1	an interesting psychological game of cat-and-mouse , three-dimensional characters and believable performances all add up to a satisfying crime drama . 
0	the trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through . 
0	it appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen . 
1	visually imaginative , thematically instructive and thoroughly delightful , it takes us on a roller-coaster ride from innocence to experience without even a hint of that typical kiddie-flick sentimentality .

0	i've heard that the fans of the first men in black have come away hating the second one . i wonder why . they felt like the same movie to me . 
1	a beautiful , entertaining two hours . you get the idea , though , that kapur intended the film to be more than that . 
0	in trying to be daring and original , it comes off as only occasionally satirical and never fresh . 
1	this surreal gilliam-esque film is also a troubling interpretation of ecclesiastes . a rewarding work of art for only the most patient and challenge-hungry moviegoers . 
0	even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity didn't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by avary's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest . 
1	[shyamalan] turns the goose-pimple genre on its empty head and fills it with spirit , purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count . 
0	at best this is a film for the under-7 crowd . but it would be better to wait for the video . and a very rainy day . 
1	delirious fun . 
0	this goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring
0	consider the film a celluloid litmus test for the intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director i admire . 
0	if swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh . 
0	the director mostly plays it straight , turning leys' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder . 
1	an engrossing and grim portrait of hookers : what they think of themselves and their clients . 
1	this isn't a retooled genre piece , the tale of a guy and his gun , but an amiably idiosyncratic work . 
0	as social exposé , skins has its heart in the right place , but that's not much to hang a soap opera on . 
1	not only is undercover brother as funny , if not more so , than both austin powers films , but it's also one of the smarter , savvier spoofs to come along in some time . 
1	chicago offers much colorful eye candy , including the spectacle of gere in his dancing shoes , hoofing and crooning with the best of them . 
0	forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining . 
0	in the real world , an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a résumé loaded with credits like " girl in bar #3 . " 
0	astonishing isn't the word -- neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap . indeed , none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is deuces wild . 
0	the actresses may have worked up a back story for the women they portray so convincingly , but viewers don't get enough of that background for the characters to be involving as individuals rather than types . 
1	whether you're moved and love it , or bored or frustrated by the film , you'll still feel something . 
1	the movie has an avalanche of eye-popping visual effects . 
0	the intent is almost exactly the same [as the full monty] . all that's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight . 
1	shiner can certainly go the distance , but isn't world championship material
0	 it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes . 
0	to my taste , the film's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation . 
0	i can easily imagine benigni's pinocchio becoming a christmas perennial . coal isn't as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children's stockings . 
0	a vile , incoherent mess . . . a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg's brilliant 'videodrome . '
1	rich in shadowy metaphor and as sharp as a samurai sword , jiang wen's devils on the doorstep is a wartime farce in the alternately comic and gut-wrenching style of joseph heller or kurt vonnegut . 
0	fairly run-of-the-mill . 
0	looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights . 
0	this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long . 
1	what time is it there ? is not easy . it haunts you , you can't forget it , you admire its conception and are able to resolve some of the confusions you had while watching it . 
0	bullock's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
0	in terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused . 
1	y tu mamá también is hilariously , gloriously alive , and quite often hotter than georgia asphalt . 
0	[the film's] taste for " shock humor " will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of tom green and the farrelly brothers . 
0	it's sweet . . . but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end . 
1	a must-see for fans of thoughtful war films and those interested in the sights and sounds of battle . 
0	it's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex . 
1	tunney , brimming with coltish , neurotic energy , holds the screen like a true star . 
0	being author wells' great-grandson , you'd think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material . but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film . 
0	the transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull . 
1	the more you think about the movie , the more you will probably like it . 
1	for all its failed connections , divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood is nurturing , in a gauzy , dithering way . 
1	a triumph , relentless and beautiful in its downbeat darkness . 
0	the film is surprisingly well-directed by brett ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act . 
0	very stupid and annoying . 
0	this thing is just garbage . 
1	hugely accomplished slice of hitchcockian suspense . 
0	overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek's novel by some way . it settles for being merely grim . 
0	boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome . 
1	so vivid a portrait of a woman consumed by lust and love and crushed by betrayal that it conjures up the intoxicating fumes and emotional ghosts of a freshly painted rembrandt . 
1	turturro is fabulously funny and over the top as a 'very sneaky' butler who excels in the art of impossible disappearing/reappearing acts
0	in the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate . 
0	stale and clichéd to a fault . 
1	with we were soldiers , hollywood makes a valiant attempt to tell a story about the vietnam war before the pathology set in . 
1	it's a much more emotional journey than what shyamalan has given us in his past two movies , and gibson , stepping in for bruce willis , is the perfect actor to take us on the trip . 
0	pompous and garbled . 
1	adaptation is simply brilliant . 
0	to the vast majority of more casual filmgoers , it will probably be a talky bore . 
1	for the first time in years , de niro digs deep emotionally , perhaps because he's been stirred by the powerful work of his co-stars . 
1	the premise of jason x is silly but strangely believable . 
1	a lot of the credit for the film's winning tone must go to grant , who hasn't lost a bit of the dry humor that first made audiences on both sides of the atlantic love him . 
0	though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by james spader and maggie gyllenhaal , i felt disrespected . 
1	those prone to indignation need not apply ; those susceptible to blue hilarity , step right up . 
0	this is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions -- a lunar mission with no signs of life . 
1	a pleasant romantic comedy . 
0	a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse . 
1	funny and , at times , poignant , the film from director george hickenlooper all takes place in pasadena , " a city where people still read . " 
1	what makes this film special is serry's ability to take what is essentially a contained family conflict and put it into a much larger historical context . 
1	the date movie that franz kafka would have made . 
0	este é apenas mais um ( longo ) episódio do programa da mtv . a única diferença é que , desta vez , a paramount teve o mau gosto de exibi-lo nos cinemas . 
0	is " ballistic " worth the price of admission ? absolutely not . it sucked . would i see it again ? please see previous answer . 
1	thrilling , provocative and darkly funny , this timely sci-fi mystery works on so many different levels that it not only invites , it demands repeated viewings . 
1	baby-faced renner is eerily convincing as this bland blank of a man with unimaginable demons within . 
1	hu and liu offer natural , matter-of-fact performances that glint with sorrow , longing and love . 
0	brown's saga , like many before his , makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie . 
0	i'm not saying that ice age doesn't have some fairly pretty pictures , but there's not enough substance in the story to actually give them life . 
0	birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it . 
0	comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class . . . . designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , " crossroads " instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns . 
1	at once a testament to the divine calling of education and a demonstration of the painstaking process of imparting knowledge . 
0	the movie's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself doesn't stand a ghost of a chance . 
0	truth to tell , if you've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there's nothing here you haven't seen before . 
0	a dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any hollywood fluff . 
1	moore provides an invaluable service by sparking debate and encouraging thought . better still , he does all of this , and more , while remaining one of the most savagely hilarious social critics this side of jonathan swift . 
0	with a tone as variable as the cinematography , schaeffer's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters' quirks and foibles never jell into charm . 
1	this cd reminds me once again why russian liturgical music is one of the treasures of the world : beautiful , profound , awe-inspiring , uplifting . for the most part , the pieces are well chosen and the performances excellent . i am delighted to see that many of the tracks are from the classic recording of the rachmaninoff vespers made in the early 1970s by the ussr ministry of culture chamber choir directed by valery polyansky , and released in the usa by angel-melodiya . i wore out my copy of the lp years ago ; although it has been reissued on cd , it 's out of print and very hard to find . so it is wonderful to see a generous selection from that recording available on this disk . listen to track 11 , `` praise the lord o my soul '' , sung by the chamber choir and mezzo irina arkhipova . you would have to have a heart of stone not to be moved as she sings `` slava ghospidin '' ( praise to the lord ) . and listen to how the basses descend to b-flat at end . it just does n't get any better than this
0	with the exception of `` my heart will go on '' by celine dion , horner 's soundtrack is not a masterpiece but a bunch of stinking skunks who are masked by a field of sweet smelling flowers . for a soundtrack score it is not riveting and really lacks any emotional connection to the film . overall it is just really overrated and the hit single got played so much that the masses just fell into a typical zombie trance and went marching to the store to buy it . this was after they kept returning to the theater to see a fictional tale of love built around a tragic , awful event . it did n't stop them though ; they could not get enough of seeing all those depictions of people freezing to death in the water . overall a below average soundtrack that road the coat tails of a hit single that was shoved down our throats for an entire year
1	if you like music you ca n't help but like mariachi from mexico . it is superb . is there another volume ? if so , tell me about it
0	ok , at long last public enemy has finally let me down by allowing a bunch of sub-par average , non-innovative , non-avent guard , dj 's mix there stuff up . even dj spookie 's mix was not that grand . everything sounds like beats that i discovered in the early 90 's . on the other hand , this album is only a couple bucks used , so i would highly highly highly suggest buying it if only for 54321 boom which is perhaps one of the best pe tracks ever to come out ! not only are the beats right on , but the lyrics are some of the hardest i 've heard yet ! and for the note , my review has nothing to do with me not being flexable to change of sound . infact i love the new pe ( whirl odor ) even though it has club friendly sounds , mainly for the fact that they are not your mere average club beats ( they are very multi-layered ) and of course the lyrics once again only get harder and harder and harder , and more direct and to the point as we aproach the last times of this world ( lyness )
1	this is without doubt the most beautiful , moving song i have ever heard . i cry every time i listen to it . i will ask my family to have it played at my funeral . the lyrics and symbolism are born of emotional genius . the solo vocalist and the instrumentation are flawless . this selection is the hope diamond of contemporary music
0	the problem with america was that started out great . the first album was fresh and different from everything . three young boys and accoustic quitars was a song all it own . `` horse with no name '' and `` sandman '' , was what pave the way for them . the problem was that each album after that they got farther away from their roots and into the middle of mainstream pop . they should of left `` muskrat love . '' to the captain and tennille . this album does a fine job of showing their career from beginning to end . the problem was that there was their first two albums , ( america and venture highway ) and there was their others . my recommandation would be to pick up the first 2 and leave this for the die hard fans
0	i do not understand why people are so waxing poetic about this album . there is nothing new or 'fresh ' or 'original ' or at all thought-brovoking about this music , unless you happen to be easily pleased by any simple pseudo-pop sound . i have only recently discovered the world of no-wave music , but i was introduced to it through artists like arab on radar and scissor girls . so when i tried out my first sonic youth album , i was way more than dissapointed . i do n't know how this can be classified as no-wave anymore . sure they show some trait in a few wailing off key guitars and an occasioinal shouted spoken word , but they are all only half-assed and are muddled up in cliche indie pop love tunes that have only been done in every other band . the most notable anything is the catchy medlody of becuz . it is really catchy , yet it managaes to be unique enough to rise above the typical `` catchy tunes '' ethos . xiu xiu 's `` knife play '' would probably be considered more of a pop/no-wave sound that does not sacrifice the aggressive anti-music drive of no-wave ... and still retain the emotional pop sinsibility . i do n't know.. all i know is that wasing machine is a letdown . it does not reach me artistically by a long shot . emotionally , i can think of am million other artists ( mars volta , emerson lake palmer , clouddead , ulver , edvard greig ! ) who can put me on a much higher cloud and help me get in touch with the human condition . this however is far to cheezy , and i do n't know , but i think it reeks of that shallow indie fashion clique..
1	this is a great cd . back where i come from , is on of those feel good songs that gives me chill bumps every time i here it . chesney is a extremely talented artist whose passion is shown in every song . i recommend all his albums
1	this mos def album is a good album to listen to . he shows off his lyrical skills and gives social commentary that is on point . why listen to a bunch of guys who have `` lil '' in front of their names when you can listen to a man give his views on life , love , and this country we live i
0	listening to this c.d . first gave me a headache , then it made my stomache churn . it is so uninspired , it 's not even funny ( or listenable ) . yeah , it 's loud , but i can be loud , too , if i had some pots and pans and a `` guitar . '' do n't get this , it 's nothing but d-r-i-v-e-l
0	boston have to be one of the worst bands ever ! ! the singer screams and they made some of the lousiest songs like rock n roll band , and the horrible more than a feeling . they would not hold a candle to smart bands like metallica who rock ! i just got metallica 's 4th lp today . get and justice for all by metallica insted
1	these 3 discs ( there is a limited edition 10 disc set which has obviously sold out ! ! ) are a continuation of live dead . if you have n't heard the dead live then start with this or live dead . you will realise why to many they were america 's greatest improvisational rock band . the playing , the interplay between the musicians - particularly garcia and lesh is staggering . and how about a big hand for bill kreutzman on drums
0	i just purchased my sacd player and picked up boston and billy joel 's the stranger at the same time . after listening to the stranger , my mouth dropped . billy 's voice coming from the center speaker and all the other instruments and melodies coming from every different direction . then i put in boston and could n't tell a difference from the cd version i already own . i think it 's one of the best albums , but if you already own it on cd , do n't bother upgrading - there 's nothing special about the sacd version
1	i have seen joe many years ago when he had played in a group called bloodline and he is even better now
1	this cd has tons of power , and soothing energy . it really shows off how well part understands the human voice

0	being an osmond fan can be very frustrating at times ... this cd has nothing new to offer . there have been several osmond compilation cds in the past 10 years . what 's so different about this one besides the photograph on the cover ? nothing . i agree with the reviewer who wishes the osmonds would put some of their old albums on cd instead of putting out hit compilation cds all the time . been there . done that . bored to tears
1	its just realy sad that hip-hop dont sound like hard to earn anymore ... gang starr still gets daily airplay on my stereo and im glad i support these guys
0	the lack of someone lurking behind prince 's shoulder while in the recording studio and having the courage to tell him when he produces second rate nonsense has been missing since the departure of the fargnoli management team . this is a poor track incorporating biblical references that have little relevance or sense of genuine compassion to the katrina disaster . musically the lack of emotion conveyed by the unnecessarily complicated chord changes and irrelevant reference to sade also make the feel of this track disjointed . while prince fans will generally hype this track , the reality is that `` 4 the tears in your eyes '' this is n't and to add a charity track with an instrumental showing off your musical skills is just pure self indulgence and frankly crass . lets hope this is not an indication of the upcoming 3121 .
1	anais is one of the best cingers . i have seen her since objetivo fama , and she is just great . do n't listen to people who say this cd is bad because the are just hating . this cd is just great
1	i have to admit that , at first listening , i found some aspects of ms.belle 's interpretations of these pieces disorienting . however , as i listened to these covers repeatedly , i can now say that i understand better what the vocalist is after . not that i always agree with her and with george duke , the arranger/producer , but i agree with their choices and their totally new project and enjoy having had my horizons broadened . ms.belle has immense talent , superb technique , and a clear idea of each piece , and she delivers the goods without faltering or compromise . i admire that a lot in a performer . her choices ask us for a reaction and we are free to accept or reject what she has offered us . when i first heard these renditions , i was quite stand-offish , but over time i have come to appreciate them more and more - almost to the point of addiction - and am grateful to regina and george for their strength of conviction as well as their superior musicianship.they do not want us to listen in a passive way , they are waiting for our reaction..and god , this is really so , so good ... .that 's the true spirit in which an album should be recorded . i 'd encourage you to get this album because it is about strong , powerful and personal interpretations of some great jazz standards by regina . you may love everything about it , or you may reject aspects of her interpretations . but in any case you will not remain indifferent ; you will be enriched by hearing these pieces in a clear and beautifully personal way . that is an important aspect of why i love this imaginative , innovative quality music and why this recording is invaluable . and it can not be said enough that her backing band is incredible , giving this album the necessary push to take it over the edge . it is a success because it skilfully avoids being categorized . regina has had the courage to break out of the traditional mould and make a successful cross-over , which some purists may not approve of ... only time will tell ... .
1	i just purchased this album , my first misfits album and every song on it rocks ( i especially like where eagles dare ) . i just bought two more albums , walk among us and static age and i wish they would hurry up and get here in the mail because i cant wait . my only complain is the sound quality . it sounds like they put a dollar store tape recorder in the corner and started rocking ... but i guess that makes it sound more real too . metallica covered a couple of their albums on their garage album but it just isnt the same .
0	this whole post crap grunge is crap . if you want real rock check out gnr , acdc , and any band pre grunge . i know this is a review but how does this grab ya . oh and i wo n't mention the thousands of stupid bands that sing like their trying to go to go to the bathroom . `` oh how did we wind up like this ? '' exactly what i 'm trying to figure out . tesla 's got more talent then all these bands and they ca n't get any airplay give me a break
0	if any kid music annoys you , this cd is not for you . these are good old classic songs , but almost ruined with strange styles and irrelevant talking to intro the songs . i 'm throwing it away . i want my two-year-old to know the songs i know and love , but this was a bad buy on my part .
0	even as dedicated of a radiohead fan as i am , i really do n't care much for this album . i say thank goodness for `` creep '' because we may have never heard from them again ( or at least not in the same way ) if that song had not become as popular as it did
0	i loved shedaisy 's first album the whole shebang . and i also really enjoy their christmas albumn . they have beautiful voices and i love the three part harmonies they come up with . i was very excited to get their newest album but i was sure dissapointed . this is a very dark and depressing album . almost every song is about lost love . also , all the songs but 1 are slow . where is the upbeat shedaisy i fell in love with ? ? ? i would suggest passing this one up and instead just listening to the whole shebang again . still , i look forward to what the future may bring from them . these sisters have alot of talent
1	the soundtrack is great but some of the good songs from the movie arent on it . overall it is a good produc
0	carter burwell 's soundtrack music to `` rob roy '' was an early sign that he was not just getting it right . the score is all wrong but so is the movie . this movie needed an uplifting score . carter burwell could not deliver it
1	i got ta be honest , when i first listened to this album i was dissapointed . but like any truly amazing album , it just took some decoding , listening to the songs multiple times reaaaallly helps to appreciate what these guys are doing . essentially , gat are four people who are amazing at what they do , and we should feel lucky that they have found a way to mesh together perfectly . their first album , emphasizer , blew me away , but i felt it lost steam around halfway through . this album does no such thing , and what is more impressive is that this is an all acoustic album , which means skerik is using the natural sound of his sax as opposed to the various effects that he is known for . this gives the album a much more natural feel and it shows that these four are able to make amazing music without any wizardry in the production department . but dont get me wrong , this cd sounds amazing . anyway , i saw them live last night in nyc , and they blew my mind ... i recommend this cd to anyone , and see them live if you get the rare opportunity !
1	as a fan of both celtic traditional and bluegrass music i was wary of a cd claiming to be a hybrid - too often it means an unsatisfactory compromise where original flavours become watered down and insipid . i need not have worried - tim o'brien has produced one of the most amazing and rewarding musical journeys i 've followed for some time . not only do the players from the two traditions blend instinctively and harmoniously but the tracks , mostly songs , are marvellous vehicles for new and exciting directions . there are superb performances all round , vocally from o'brien with guests paul brady , maura o'connell , kathhy mattea , del mccoury etc and musicians altan , frankie gavin , jerry douglas , earl scruggs , seamus egan and a host of others and the sound is fresh , acoustic and vital , requiring no production gimmicks or effects . standout songs for me personally are `` mountaineer is always free '' , `` lost little children '' , `` wandering '' and `` john riley '' although there is not a weak track on the cd . it is obvious that for tim o'brien this has been a labour of love . if you like acoustic music , from any tradition , either side of the atlantic , you 'll love it . several of my friends have bought it on my recommendation and agree it is brilliant
0	with the caliber of musicians playing on this album , i expected a hard hitting original . instead we get re-arranged covers and lots of `` filler '' salsa . no surprises here . the classic salsa albums are worth your cash but if you are curious , you 'll play this one once
1	the title gets it right - this is a very fun album . there are a lot of great songs on here . infectious lyrics and music - it still surprises me that matthew sweet is n't more popular than he is . one other thing ... it 's a sin that `` we 're the same '' was n't a bigger hit than it was . truly a great song
1	this disc dates from monk 's early period before he achieved recognition and started to descend into a long series of formulaic recordings for columbia . so it 's valuable from that point of view . it 's also a wonderful chance to hear him showcased without horns although the standard is perhaps not quite as high as the trio blue note recordings that immediately preceded it . the best tracks both from a musical and recording quality view point are an extended blue monk , which many consider the definitive version , and a lovely unaccompanied just a gigolo , which anticipates later solo masterpieces such as alone in san francisco . sweet and lovely is in a similarly reflective vein . much of the rest of the album has a forceful , driving quality , with aggressive use of dissonance in places - even for monk . a particular highlight is monk tearing through these foolish things
1	thoroughly enjoyed the cd . have some of the songs as performed by other artists , but it 's nice to hear them as performed by the writer . i 'm always impressed by one with that kind of creativity .
0	just like in my other review i ca n't figure out the madness over these guys . i will ask in this post as well for somebody to actually explain to me why they should be heard and are relevant in a creative way . honestly people you ca n't call these guys artists . an artist creates something from a idea or two these guys take those ideas and just lump them together . it 's as simple as that . and to top it of they do n't have the chops as musicians to be relevant in that form either . a comment like `` they rock '' or `` the lead singer is soooo hot '' are n't examples of a great artist or band . from the dates of the last post my words might be in vain , kind of like the validity of this record . because there has n't been a post on here for two years . if a fan of banking benjamins does stumble upon this post i invite you to check out my other reviews , and checkout some relevant and great music
1	... else if michigan was on vinyl i would have worn it out by now . illinois was my first venture into the sound-world of sufjan stevens , and no doubt it his most impressive outing to date . however the subtle spendour of the earlier michigan has ousted it as my favourite . perhaps less eclectic and entertaining than illinois , but more soulful and beautiful . ultimately it 's the one i 'd take to the proverbial desert island . there 's not a single track in this 74 minute cd that i 'd want to skip or drop from my mp3 playlist , but highlights for me are romulus ( gentle and heartbreaking ) , sleeping bear ( musically gorgeous ) , and vito 's ordination song ( like being gently hugged ) . p.s . so often the 'bonus tracks ' on a cd can seem superfluous and substandard but the 2 extras on my cd ( marching band and pickerel lake ) are both excellent .
0	i like meav 's voice , and this cd is ok , if you like this kind of stuff . think slow and somewhat depressing . i think irish music has moved on so much since bill whehlan of riverdance brought it into the modern times , and came up with this vocal sound , i guess to hark back to earlier times , which worked well because riverdance has so much contrast in it and the choir songs only appear as relief to the other music . this is all a bit samey and dull . i would say saved by this lady 's fine voice though
0	you win some and you lose some . this purchase was a definite loss . what a dissapointment
1	while not dissimilar to other excellent acts such as coldplay , keane , and pete yorn , travis have distinguished themselves as a band with their own unique style and sound . this , their 2nd album , is the best of their music : melodic throughout , with catchy tunes , solid lyrics , and tremendous guitar work that captures the listener from the first chords of 'sing ' to the fade-out from 'the humpty dumpty love song ' . if you buy an album once you know three or four or more of its songs are excellent , then i confidently recommend the invisible band to you . rating each song individually for one 's ipod : 1 . sing , side , the cage , afterglow and the humpty dumpty love song are each worthy of four to five stars 2 . pipe dreams , flowers in the window , safe , follow the light , and indefinitely are three to four star songs 3 . the balance are two to three stars each . the only poor effort is probably `` last train '' , which is too plodding relative to its counterparts the invisible band is basically a healthy mix of folksy , hopeful songs mixed with just the right amount of melancholy . nowhere is this better reflected than in 'the humpty dumpty love song ' , which defines this mix perfectly . while this is the best of the album , the rest is well worth listening to repeatedly . highly recommended
1	i used to listen to a friend 's copy of the original `` metal box '' of ep 's , when it first came out . years later the `` second edition '' came out on lp 's for those of us who had n't sprung for the metal box before it sold out . eventually the second edition came out on this cd . so i finally could own a digital copy myself . pristine , audio quality at least as good as the original metal box in my opinion , if i remember correctly . you do need to listen to this . you do need to buy a copy and get other people to listen to this too
1	this cd is soo cool ! ! i love all the songs ! they are all good efforts . i especially like mr. coffee you have got ta hear that song ! other than that this is a great cd ! ! buy it today ! ! you 'll enjoy i
1	this album is a classic , but its really short . dead prez are the best duo in rap in my opinion . i highly recommend this and all of dead prez 's other albums
1	with all the 'neuvo flamenco ' and its accompaning popularity . it is nice ( and a relief ) i might add , to hear the flamenco guitar in its purist form . not only does this cd contain sabicas and nino ricardo . it also contains four very rare perfomances by manolo de huelva . which are difficult to find anywhere . also included are melchor de marchena performing six pieces . this is truly pure flamenco at its best
0	based on the reviews for this cd i decided to buy it without having sampled it . big mistake . i love , among others , marshall crenshaw , don dixon and peter holsapple , but what happened here ? this was so not fabulous
0	although prince is an utter genious ! this cd is merely a boring contract filler . i suggest you buy one of his older albums or the new album `` musicology '' instead
0	the schumann that is presented here is a forgery . do n't get me wrong . i 'm not railing against schumann at all . the question here is what makes schumann great , and the way that bernstein presents these symphonies says schumann is great for the wrong reasons . the real schumann that lived was a completely different person than what we might assume from listening to this particular presentation of his music . schumann was not a hopeless romantic . he was one composer in a long line of `` classicists '' which ended with brahms , yet at the same time he was an innovator , pushing forward , trying to find new stylistic and technical means of expression . he had plenty of dignity , and he did n't write his music as a desperate plea for the world to like him , which is exactly what it sounds like here . bernstein trudges through these fine works as if he were dying . yes , many of these performances are the slowest on record , but this is a bad thing . these beautiful works lose value immeasurably when they are saturated with thick , waxy , overly romantic textures and phrasing . tell me , did schumann ever write : `` to be played extremely histrionically and melodramatically , with the greatest possible amount of cheese and theatrics '' in his score ? no ! he did not . these performances are not more expressive than others in the real sense of the word , and any person in his/her right mind should be able to see this . you may be able to hear the orchestration more clearly than in karajan 's filth , but that 's not saying much at all . and for this slight favor bernstein does for the music , he makes it infinitely worse when he stretches the fabric of these works beyond their limit . the most blatant example is the third movement of the second symphony , taken at half tempo . all semblance of melody and motion is lost . this movement is supposed to be several minutes shorter than the first , and not the longest movement of the symphony , not to mention the longest movement in the entire set . in fact , almost every movement of every symphony could stand to have at least a minute hacked off of its timing . also , while looking at the scores , you might notice that bernstein does away with detail work this time around . carefully laid out phrasing and the dynamic arch are thrown out of the window in favor of grand `` romantic '' gestures . observing details in schumann , ironically , helps to make the music speak more freely and honestly . this is n't honest music-making here , only a self-indulgent conductor once again plastering his image over the face of great art
1	this is a great collection of hits from the 70 's . it is packed with hits . it is a great addition to a 70 's hits collection
0	i gave this a good listen , but did not find it all that funny ... or memorable
1	no collection of blues/rock is complete without `` a piece of your soul '' . there very simply is not a weak track on the entire disc . from the raunchy ( `` bitter rain '' ) to the uplifting ( `` good day for the blues '' ) to the bittersweet ( `` cynical '' ) to the soft ( `` share that smile '' ) storyville encompasses the entire range of musical expression with a style that is as provocative as it is unique . put this disc on your list of music to have on a deserted island
0	michael jackson is one of the most gifted songwriters/singers of our time . you can discuss his person , you can discuss his behaviour , and all the other stuff , but you ca n't really take that away from him . and that 's exactly why this album is so unacceptable , coming from someone like him - when you 've reached superstardom and gone beyond it , you do n't release a record that 's so horribly mixed up and full of second grade tracks that it 's bound to be a faliure . at least , you should expect to hear for it . and hear for it he did , cause the critics did n't go lightly on this one . and it 's not that bad , actually . i mean , that 's what i have my program function in my cd-player for , and my cd-burner . the album starts on a fair streak - unbreakable , heartbreaker and invincible - are all fair tracks - below average for mj , sounds like a watered down selection of discarded tracks from dangerous that were then discarded for history and then discarded for blood on the dance floor , and full of badly placed guest rappers to top it off - but apart from that , if you forget who made this music , these are actually good , funky dance tracks . for michael jackson they 're passable , but nothing more . *skip* on to track 8 - speechless - arguably the strongest moment on the record . one of only two tracks that jackson actually penned himself , and it shows . the amount of emotion in his voice will knock you prone , and actually proves very well what the rest of the album lacks : joy for the music , and personal emotion . the lyrics are like a poem , and one of the most beautiful love declarations in all their simplicity . top grade to jackson for this one track , and if you are into his music , buy the cd cheeply just to get this track . track 9 - 2000 watts - is another of the stronger moments of the record . this one is simply plain fun , and that 's another important lesson jackson should have lurned - to let go of the reigns , and stop caring whether it 's hip or street or down with the trend - because it is n't - but this is darn good pop music , and nigh irresistable . *skip* on to track 13 - cry - penned by r. kelley . the same r. kelley who is guilty of writing one of the most horrible songs of all times ( i believe i can fly , if you had doubts ) , but it seems that with jackson , he can do no wrong . he wrote the endearing you are not alone - major hit in europe - and this track is possibly even better . oh , forget about the sappy lyrics , and just enjoy the wonderfull music . this is pop writing in top class , and if jackson sounds like he takes the marthyr role a bit too seriously , it 's still one of the best tracks on the record . track 14 - the lost children - is the other song penned by michael alone , and it 's not a bad effort - had it not been for the children choir and sleezy intro , you could probably have ignored the lyrics and enjoyed a nice pop tune . as it is , it falls somewhat flat , and becomes completely choking in the end - but yes , it 's a nice tune . thumps up , mr. jackson . track 15 - whatever happens . ok , that 's one weird track . michael jackson featuring santane . wtf ? well , kudos for doing this , and it actually works , in a sort of absurd way . not single potential , and not a classic , but it 's not embarassing , and as an album filler , it 's completely acceptable as a cureosity . well , what about the rest of it then ? lead single you rock my world was never my favorite - the spoken intro is downright embarassing - but the track is not bad . i can accept that on the record . the same is not true for the horrible ballads break of dawn , heaven can wait , butterflies , you are my life and do n't walk away . one is worse than the next , and every time i just try to listen to them , i start chocking to the degree of loosing my last meal . yes , it 's that bad , no really , it 's horrible . i . ca n't . stand . these . songs . period . there are simply no redeeming qualities for me . and then the two monstrosities - privacy and threatened - that just sound like a very - very - bad joke on the man himself . tabloid junkie from history actually worked , because it packed a great punch , and well , had not been heart before . well it had been , it was pretty much the same as why you wan na trip on me from dangerous , but still . it worked . ghosts was a good track of blood on the dance floor . forget about the movie that was - well , embarassing . but the music was good . these tracks are n't . they sound dated , repetitive , out of place and utterly boring and uninspired . get over it jackson , we do n't want to hear more about the media nagging you , it 's not going to make them go away . well , all in all , what do we have ... to take the album from a to z : unbreakable - 6/10 - a fair dance track . heartbreaker - 6/10 - same . invincible - 6/10 - same . break of dawn - 0/10 - horrible r'n'b overproduced . vomit . heaven can wait - 0/10 - same . you rock my world - 5/10 - well , at least it sounds new . butterflies - 0/10 - more vomit . speechless - 10/10 - the flower in the dirt . one true mj song . 2000 watts - 8/10 - very enjoyable , and stands out tall compared to the rest . you are my life - 0/10 - even more vomit . privacy - 2/10 - yawn . repetitive and dated . do n't walk away - 0/10 - end of vomit . cry - 9/10 - beautiful showmanship , kelly + jackson works - again . the lost children - 6/10 - well , it has potential . whatever happens - 7/10 - interesting , and well , refreshing , if somewhat strange . threatened - 2/10 - same as privacy , and exactly as boring . this yields and average about 3.6/10 , or 2/5 stars , which actually matches my fealings for this album fairly well . yes , i 'm harsh , but from a man as gifted as jackson , you just expect more . quality control next time , please , mr. jackson . on the bottom line : outtakes the way you love me and we 've had enough showed up on the 2004 ultimate collection and outranked 2/3 of this album by far . go figure
0	do you know why this double cd is often in the bargain basement ? simply because it is an inferior product . for some very odd reason , the compiler at the record company decided to put 13 live songs instead of the studio versions that we all remember . for all we know , it may have been a copyright problem . i bought this for my dad about 5 years ago , but we were both unaware of the live recordings until we played it . the live recordings on this cd are dismal and not related to the awesome `` hot august night '' . fortunately for me , i own the right neil diamond cd 's which contain the studio versions . these are still available . the first is called `` 12 greatest hits '' ( a black and white photo a young neil ) , and the second is called `` 12 greatest hits volume 2 '' ( a colour photo of neil sitting on a sofa ) . both of these contain all the studio versions - and not one live recording in sight ! ! ! just released is a new compilation called neil diamond gold , as part of the gold series but i do not know if it too contains the dreadful live recordings . all i know is that it is missing a lot of key tracks
1	some of the catchiest melodies and harmonies ever from curt . lots of cool instrumentation . pete anderson did a great job with the production . this has n't left my cd player since i got it 4 days ago
0	this cd is pretty awful , you wonder why leona even got the chance to record a cd , one of the worst songs ever is calling , , it sounds like taunting from elementary school kids on the playground , na na na na , na na na na , i agree with the reviewer who said she is a very weak edie brickell sounding singer ... ... ..
0	i absolutely love charlotte church 's voice , but i could n't stand even 1 song on this cd . she 's lowered herself to a `` brittany spears-wanna-be . '' monotone songs , horrible bass , every song sounds the same . i am extremely disappointed in this collection of music . buy this one and you 're just wasting your money . would the real charlotte church please come back ? ? ? ?
0	i really really really really like allison moorer . have been a fan since her first record , have road-tripped to see her numerous times , and love her songwriting and singing . that said -- `` getting somewhere '' is by far the least satisfying of her records . no memorable songs . over-produced . no `` guts '' , as another reviewer said . when the allison moorer/doyle `` butch '' primm songwriting team called it quits ( in more ways than one ) , their lennon/mccartney-caliber teamwork was lost . not that moorer sounds like the beatles , but allison and butch complemented each other well when composing music . this cd is not only unmemorable but i doubt i would care to ever listen to it again . such a shame . i 've never had anything negative to say about allison in the 8 years i 've been a fan . but this cd left me cold . it hurts a bit to say this , but i can not recommend this cd . the closest analogy i can think of that relates to how different this cd is from her earlier work is the b-story line from an episode of `` the larry sanders show '' . in that episode , sanders ' head writer phil ( played by wallace langham ) finally got himself a girlfriend and was happy . as a result he lost his edge . when he was a miserable person he was an edgy , cynical , funny jokewriter . when he was a happy person he stopped being the kind of funny that he needed to be to do his job . same with moorer . since her recent changes in her social life she has started `` singing a sweeter tune '' in her life , but it came with a cost . she does n't seem to be the same songwriter anymore and it was that `` other '' songwriter who was so good -- a little edgy , sad , sometimes bitter , or at least that 's how i interpreted it . granted , that was n't her entire oeuvre , but it is what made her songs special for me . now she 's happy and she might as well be writing songs for barney the dinosaur
1	jeff beck is far from the typical rock guitarist . he never took the easy path of showing how fast or virtuoso he is . instead , he is full of intriguing and explosive ideas that make you want to listen to this cd over and over again . that 's what musicianship is all about , and jeff has plenty of it
0	i just want to slap who ever keeps coming out with these.hard.okay , there are some song that deserve this.to be ruined by off key 10-year-olds with annoying high squeaky voices.but come on ! they killed 'my immortal ' ! that is a beautiful song ! i 'm listning to it as i write this ! and also , little 6-year-olds can not properly appreciate it ! and , let 's face it , 'my immortal ' is not exactly a kiddie song.i mean , do you want your little 4-year-old boy listning to 'your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams , your voice it chased away all the sanity in me , these wounds wo n't seem to heal , this pain is just too real , there 's just too much that time can not erase ' ? please , stop buying this crap ! not only do they ruin the great songs of our generation , but they also put on some really innapropriate songs.i mean , come on ! go look up the lyrics to 'toxic ' ! that is definatly not a good song for little children . of corse , the only reason any child would like this is because their older sibling listens to it.then someone should sit them down and explain why this is not for them . die kidz bop
1	this album is hard ! e-40 always come sic wit it . if you do n't got it , ya betta git it . it reminds me of his ( my fav . ) '' i a major way '' album . sluppin ' from intro till outro . he is the bay area 's finnest . please belave it
1	this is a good compilation of afi 's songs over the 10+ years they 've been together . it 's easily worthy of 10 stars . this cd allows newcomers to listen to the progress leading up to sing the sorrow , and to get more intimate with the band . i hav n't purchased this album yet , because i already have all their albums , but plan on it . the new tracks are from the answer that , and very proud of ya era . they 've finally been released on cd . this is a cool little feature fo newcomers also . anyway , buy this album only if you hav n't heard any of afis music but want to give it a try
0	on the liner notes to one of the two blues albums ( i think it is shaker ) it is said that the original idea was just to perform some of these songs in a one night concert . that should have been as far as it went . to foist these songs on an unsuspecting public at 19 bucks a crack is highway robbery . if these are blues songs , then i am robert johnson 's illegitimate son . `` death letter '' is good , maybe even great , but can not compare to the original or to any of the covers i have previously heard . the rest is a waste of time . the cover art is excellent but hardly the reason you would be expected to buy the cd . these are my first 2 reviews by the way , but all these 5-star reviews for both cd 's finally got me motivated . go buy a muddy waters or lightning hopkins cd and save 10 bucks in the bargain
0	boo-wop ? haha ok , anyways i bought his through middle-piller distro . and it 's got a couple of o.k . songs on it . the problem is the singing and the overall production . this is definetely a home-recording on computer deal . the vocals are waaaaay weak . what exactly is a `` re-worked '' debut album ? ? ? i thought once an album was out it was done , set in stone ? apparently not , so mister monster gets to pull a blitzkid ( who changed their first album cover years after it came out ! ) and take the cheezy way out . a definete step up from bands like blitzkid , but still in the cellar of rock n roll . do yourself a favor and buy some good old deathrock from the golden years
0	whilst leo kottke plays guitar like a man with three hands and john fahey like a man with at least 11 or 12 fingers , robbie basho plays like a man with about eight thumbs . that this kind of tuneless twanging should be mentioned in the same breath as anything by kottke or fahey ( or peter lang ) is puzzling to say the least . but , credit where credit 's due : it 's not easy to make an acoustic guitar sound this unpleasant
0	why is dylan taking sole credit on an album featuring a fair percentage of other peoples song writing ? shame on you bob
1	being quite the fan of grace slick , jefferson airplane , and other 60s groups , i bought this album only having heard two songs on it -- '' daydream nightmare '' and `` outlaw blues '' . at first i was a little puzzled -- the great society sounded different than any band i 'd ever heard before . after listening to it about two more times , i realized this uniqueness was a good thing ! they sound a little rougher than your average 60s band , and they were -- grace , her first husband , and her brother-in-law assembled this band out of a few of their friends and it only was around for about a year . the great society definitely is n't a band for everyone , but if you love interesting-sounding music , want to hear some of the earlier forms of psychedelic rock , or are just curious about how grace slick sounded before the *smoother* recordings of jefferson airplane , this is the band for you ! a quick review of all the songs : sally go 'round the roses : a great way to open this cd . pay special attention to the instrumental break in the middle -- it 's amazing ! ( any time this group does an instrumental solo , it will be very good . ) did n't think so : in my opinion , one of the weaker songs on this album , but a fine song just the same . grimly forming : an overall fantastic song to listen to with intriguing lyrics and another great instrumental section . ( i love the tambourine -- it adds an interesting air to the song . ) somebody to love : yes , here it is -- the original version of the jefferson airplane hit , written by darby slick , grace 's brother-in-law . this has a much less *psychedelic* sound than the ja version , but they 're both equally as good . father bruce : this is a very catchy song written about lenny bruce as if he were a preacher . fun to sing along with . outlaw blues : this is a cover of a bob dylan song , i think . grace 's voice on this is incredible . often as i may : another fun song that 's almost as catchy as father bruce . arbitration : this song is mostly some great instrumentals but features some singing from david minor ( he did rhythm guitar , i believe . ) white rabbit : yup , another original version of a ja song ! this song 's about 6:20 because there are 4 minutes of great guitar/sax playing at the beginning . almost better than the ja version ! that 's how it is : a cheery song with fun words . you 'll definitely be singing this one aftewards . darkly smiling : this is another `` weak link '' on the cd . ( there are n't many , thankfully ! ) it does have some interesting lyrics , though . nature boy : grace 's singing/recorder playing make this song memorable . you ca n't cry : this is a fun rock song , with the usual great guitar playing from darby slick . daydream nightmare : this is one of the more *psychedelic* and dark songs on the album , with great bass and guitar playing and more of grace 's recorder . this is definitely not a song to skip over . everybody knows : also a fun rock song , and yes , another catchy one . born to be burned : this song is a little less exceptional , but it does have a good bass line , and some good guitar . father : a fantastic way to end the album ! this song is a nearly-seven minute long instrumental that builds up to an amazingly frantic crescendo . not a song that will keep you bored
0	ok , i 've listened to fat boy slim . that guy 's stuff is n't bad , by no means main stream , but worth while . but ... this norman cook - he 's horrible . it 's no wonder cook developed an alter ego . with the exception of a few easily recognisable tunes , i could n't believe this `` stuff '' had come from the same artist that produced praise you . renegade master is the type of track i 've come to know and respect ( that one is a keeper ) , and i have to give props for i left my wallet in el segundo . other than that , this album sounds like someone mixed songs from the first dozen records they found during their expedition to the flea market . if this is the sound you 're looking for , save a few bucks , check out your local yard sales . so as not to be too negative , i 'll say this ; the printing job on the cd itself is charming . the notion of making it look like a turntable was inspired
0	i hate it when rock stars form those g0d awful `` supergroups '' . ca n't people see that putting a whole bunch of different people from different bands together in one band is just a marketing scam and nothing more ? there 's no such thing as a good supergroup . the supergroup is the only kind of band that deliberately tries to $ uck . when damn yankees released their 1990 debut , every song on it was so incredibly generic , there was no hope for this band . the whole album seemed rushed and thrown together . they had nothing meaningful to say with these songs , it just seemed like they were pumping out filler and hoping somebody would be stupid enough to fall for their `` supergroup '' scam . the big , booming , arena rock choruses just ring hollow . i guess they 're trying to be catchy and have memorable hooks , but to me , it just sounds like a lot of filler . supergroups will always suck , because they diliberately try to sound bad ! thats right people ! supergroup members know that since they 're already popular , the album they 're putting out is guaranteed to be a big seller -- -- '' why bother trying to come up with good songs ? we 're already popular , so people will buy it no matter how bad it is ! lets just put out filler . '' supergroups are a total farce , its just easy money for the people involved , and nothing more . if you buy any album by any supergroup , than you my friend , are a sucker ! if you want to hear shaw or blades at their best , just keep listening to any styx or night ranger album , and avoid anything by damn yankees , or any other supergroup
0	once again , the geniuses at universal have failed to give fans a decent collection ! although the single disc very best of released in 2005 provided a fine and simplistic overview of robert palmer 's career , it omitted a few `` must have '' songs in favour of live material ( making for a 90 % ok collection ) . earlier anthologies also suffered invariably from `` redo '' syndrome : the artist redoing a vocal track here , a drum mix there , re-recording entire songs elsewhere . this collection 's no different . in fact , there are many `` remixed '' and `` redone '' and `` alternate vocal '' mixes present ( something the very best of album avoided altogether , much to its credit ) . here , insult is further added to injury with poor song sequencing . indeed , the classic and sequenced `` sailing shoes/hey julia/sneaking sally through the alley '' trilogy that marked the beginning of palmer 's breakthrough album is present , but the songs have been scattered apart from one another . thereby pondering the question : what were they thinking ? why was this done in this manner ? what do fans really want ? a 2 disc set that features the original material ( remastered , yes , but not remixed in any way , shape or form ) and a proper chronological sequence . done in this manner , such a set would properly honour one of popdom 's most memorable and talented individuals . what gold has done showed that compilers went through a rock encyclopedia , took the right batch of songs , but mish-mashed them in a half-cobbled manner . this collection does no one any favours . stick to very best of until another bright light at universal tries their hand at compiling a decent collection . that said , the way the music biz is these days , do n't count on it .
0	my two parakeets seem to enjoy this cd a bit , but if you want a cd for relaxing listening , be prepared to be irritated . i tried to go to sleep listening to it one night . i had to turn it off because it just got on my nerves ... ..i kept thinking it was stuck ... .like a record stuck in a grrove . it sometimes seems they recorded it by just hitting the `` repeat '' button on a couple of bird sounds . i think i could have done that . i 'm just glad it did n't cost a lot , but now i can see why . sorry for such a bad review , but i just had to tell anyone planning on buying it . i now just play it for my birds when i am not in the room
1	eddie 's first all-studio recording , and the album that got me hooked . i must say that even though they are uncomparably fantastic live , this album demonstrates the range and diversity of eddie from ohio . `` oh my brother '' is a particular favorite with julie murphy wells displaying her amazing range and beautiful voice , and robbie schaffer 's talent for emoting the absolute best of a heartwrenching situation . if this song does n't touch your heart , you have no appreciation for music . a particular plus on this album is a beautiful violin solo of `` yerushalyim shel zahav '' by guest musician pete wilson on `` jerusalem , '' another song by robbie , this time also performed by him . as always , the amazing prowess of this group is displayed magnificently
1	sometimes i like to look up and see what i can find on some of my favorite bands from the 70 's and starz being one of them . i was lucky enough to see the band play a few times around 77 and 78 . another band that took time for their fans ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i read through the many reviews of posted here on amazon and not sure if there is much that i can add , also great to see that there were so many out there that enjoyed the band and their music . i would recommend reading about each of the starz cd 's and listening to the sound files if available and deciding for yourself ... ... .. i remember i liked this cd so much and the logo as well , i even hand- made a stencil and made my own starz shirt , i think i used some of that gold `` glue on glitter '' in a tube and had one of the first starz shirts , before the band even had any if i remember right . lots of good songs on this cd , pull the plug being one of my favorites both on the lp/cd and live . all good rock songs from a band that deserved a lot more ... ... ... i could go on trying to describe the music ... ... ... . too bad there are no sound files for this cd ... ... . so you may just have to order it and take a chance . the remaining members have played a few shows during the past year or so and guitar player richie ranno continues to be active in the music business , you may even want to go over to starzcentral to get updated and see what richie and the band are up to . singer michael lee smith also had a brother that had his own band and later ventured into hollywood ... ... . but this is about starz ! ! ! ... so ... . i highly recommend checking out the cd 's and starzcentral . not to be confused with the movie channel or another band from europe that is using the name recently
1	this remasted disc is nice with the bonus tracks and spiffed up sound , but the only way top hear aoxomoxoa is to find a original w7 ( warner brothers-seven arts ) green label vinyl pressing . the cd features the 1971 remix ( like the 1989 cd ) in which 1/3 of the backing has been stripped like constanten 's prepared backrounds on `` what 's become of the baby '' , the extra drums and barbershop vocal on `` doin that rag '' . st stephen lost something in the remix as well . anthem was remixed as well in 1972 but the band was wise to issue the 1968 mix on cd . no hidden goodies on this disc , but the bonus tracks are great
1	lead singer and co-founder david gates was recently inducted into the songwriters hall of fame . this album is one prime example of why . david has consistently provided beautiful melodies with easy , sensitive lyrics . his last album was a country album called `` love is always seventeen , '' which was a genre-crossing mix of pop and country , co-produced and performed with billy dean . but back to this gem . `` guitar man , '' and `` aubrey '' were the big hits off of this album , and they still stand the test of time . `` tecolote '' is one of their most unusual departures , and still makes me laugh , while enjoying its musicality and orignality . `` did n't even know her name '' is a poignant lost love song ; `` welcome to the music '' is one of those opening songs bands sometimes did to orient their fans to what to expect . even larry knechtel gets in on the vocals with the intriguing `` picture in my mind . '' it 's a great album -- -in fact , there 's not a bad `` bread '' album out there ! enjoy , and relive those magical moments of the glorious seventies
0	in the classic and disturbing 1972 movie deliverance , lewis ( burt reynolds ) gives this ominous warning to ed ( jon voigt ) : `` machines are going to fail . systems are going to fail . then ... survival . '' what , i wonder , will richard d. james ( a.k.a . aphex twin , a.k.a . afx ) do when the machines fail ? it 's been nearly five years since his underappreciated album drukqs , where we got a tantalizing possible answer to this question : the plaintive , lovely , satie-esque acoustic keyboard nocturnes intermingled among the abstract , frantic electronic soundscapes throughout its sprawling duration . [ another intriguing solution was proposed on the album acoustica : alarm will sound performs aphex twin ... ] chosen lords , rdj 's first proper cd release since then , is actually a collection of various tracks from his `` analord series '' of overpriced , elaborately packaged 12-inch vinyl singles that he 's been cranking out over the last year or so . those who were put off by the excesses and overt eccentricity of drukqs may hail these cryptically titled , drum-machine laden compositions as a `` return to greatness . '' indeed , afx is certainly reviving a more compact , accessible ( for him ) , and straightforward style here , with comparatively regular ( though not quite danceable ) rhythms and those comforting underlying simple synthesizer melodies . i have to say , though , that there 's a disappointing and somewhat melancholy sense here of a great musical mind spinning its wheels . by returning to such familiar ground he seems to be setting up systems and letting them run their course in an almost cynical way , without any of the maniacal glee that was once part of his singular musical personality on unforgettable releases like come to daddy , windowlicker , the richard d. james album , and , yes -- drukqs . notably lacking are the voices that once regularly appeared in his productions -- true , they were usually rather unsettling , distorted , and manipulated voices , but at least they added some welcome humanity . also missing are those rare but beautiful moments of repose ( ballads ? ) such as `` flim , '' `` nannou '' and the striking piano interludes on drukqs . in the end , chosen lords , while an undeniably interesting and expertly produced collection of electronic music , is nonetheless a sterile , static , joyless affair . if it inspires any emotion at all , it will probably be pity and sadness as you listen to a possible musical genius coasting along without exploring any new directions for the first time in his otherwise remarkable career . yes , i 'm afraid the machines have failed richard d. james , and i sincerely hope he can survive in this cold and remote musical wilderness of his own creation..
0	before you all dismiss me as an obsessive , close-minded thrash fanatic ; i thoroughly enjoyed `` chaos ad , '' which was a sep ' album with the perfect balance of experimentation and death metal . i like the idea of experimenting with tribal sounds , but with those sounds , max decided to throw in downtuned guitars , not doing guitar solos , excessive profanity , lame `` i hate this i hate that '' lyrics , and guest musicians . the only decent songs on here are `` roots bloody roots '' and `` dictators*** ; '' everything else is awful . this is n't sepultura , this is soulfly . i 'm glad max left because if he stayed in the band , sep ' would have degenerated into a nu-metal band . for good sepultura albums , get these instead ( starting with the best ) : schizophrenia morbid visions/bestial devastation beneath the remains arise chaos ad dante xxi nation roorback ps , you max fanatics need to cut derik green some slack , he 's keeping sep ' alive while max is making an arse of himself with soulfly
1	the relaxation set is just that , pure relaxation . i love the active relaxation cd . i can read or work and i am real calm , on an even keel , feeling like when you go to sleep at night , not quite asleep and not quite awake . i also enjoy the water and the piano playing . highly recommended
0	ok , so the song playing when brian goes and we see mia for the first time is a song called `` deep enough ( urban remix ) '' by live . i have the other songs written down , including the one played between the two buildings , so i will find them and tell you . if you all want only the songs that were actually in the movie , rent the dvd , and take about ten minutes to watch the credits and write down the song names and artists . that 's how i have only the songs that are in the movie
0	i ca n't believe rubbish like this goes platinum . rap today with a few exceptions is a joke . people like chingy , nelly , ludacris , ja rule , lil jon and any other idiot with lil in their name are ruining rap and making it look like a joke . what is really getting me angry is how so many people do n't give any respect to real rap legends like tupac and biggie , and give tons of respect to all these clowns . people are thinking this is the sort of stuff rap fans listen to . all these people talk about is money , bling bling and sex . rap used to be about the streets now its just all i 've got so much money and stuff . if you want a real rap cd then get one of the following . nwa - straight outta compton ice cube - amerikka 's most wanted dr dre - the chronic snoop doggy dogg - doggystyle nas - illmatic tha dogg pound - dogg food tupac - me against the world tupac - all eyez on me tupac - greatest hits 50 cent - power of the dollar biggie - life after death you get the picture
1	i agree with most of the reviewers that this band was very underated.great singing electric and acoustic guitar playing and great songs.why were songs like natures way and i got a line not huge hits ? i got a line made the top 40 i think.natures way was a great acoustic ballad.also nothing to hide has a nice acoustic/electric section.also mister skin could of been a hit catchy.this band was better than a lot of the crap that came out in the late 1960 's all the bad hippie bands of that era.as for the whole album i think it would get five stars if it had some live tracks as bonus cuts , like a live i got a line or natures way live hearing that live would of been fun . i heard samples on a live spirit cd.a great unknown band that everyone should give a listen to and to remember what real musicians and songs were about in the old days
0	this cd is not at all what it appears to be . they got other people singing and playing the music , so it 's not what you 're probably looking for . terrible misrespresentation . i was so disappointed ! thank goodness i used my other party cd 's or my guests would have left ... ... and i would have held the door open ... ..not blamed them for leaving !
0	i ca n't believe the other people giving this high marks . i love the wheel , but darn if this is n't just terrible . there is n't even a single on it ; i ca n't believe the studio released it . thank god i got a promotional copy and did n't have to go buy it in the store . the catherine wheel needs to get back together -- quick
1	wonderful cd the music brings back a lot of childhood memories ! a must have for those who are looking for a cd that includes neil diamond 's top hits .
0	with 2 cds of endless repeated chords , they do n't have much to say
1	this album is the shyit , cougnut and c-fresh deliver , the only problem you might have with this album is figuring out which one is cougnut and which one is c-fresh , but as you listen you will tell differences . `` back in the days '' is real old album , so audio can be bad for a couple of the tracks but there isnt a weak track on this album . the beats do n't get too bass heavy untill `` hillary '' after that song the next 4 tracks or so are very bass heavy , but the flows are tops . these guys are the definition of gangsta , and is a must for anybody who likes gangsta rap . all guests are sick to , dre dog , cellski , chewy , r.b.l,2.2 and mack and al kapone . definetly a classic
1	after watching the movie walk the line , i wanted to hear more of johnny cash . all these years ( 35 of them ) i always thought he was just a slow folk singer . his music is non-stop foot tapping soul grabbing stuff . he toured with elvis presely and jerry lee lewis . he inspired musicians like bob dylan . i am so glad i bought this cd . it 's the best purchase i made all year .
1	i love this album but the other review from anonymous is wrong . this cd is not remastered . i baught this cd because of that review and got burned . the cd even says right on it aad . in other words analog recording/analog master/digital playback . i will say this much though , the transfer is better than mca 's version which i own . however , if you want a remastered version of the song monster look to the `` all time greatest hits/original recording remasterd '' cd from mca . it also has move over from this cd , i love this cd and want it remastered . if you got ta have this album ( i do ) than this version sounds better than the mca version
0	all in all , i was really dissapointed ; i really enjoyed the king geedorah album . i thought the king geedorah album boasted stellar , thematic , production , tolerable skits , and street-wise but deep lyrical content . doom is on the boards for about 1/3 of the tracks on 'escape ... ' all have the stereotypical doom sound , with the only standout being '1,2 ... 1,2 . ' the x-ray produced tracks are minimal , but generally sound stiff , lacking much of a groove - thin synth lines , few sampled melodies . i did like 'warning ( kong ) , ' which has a nice , minimal , dark groove . the lyrical flows have a classic new york sound , pretty good . lyrical content is pretty bad , unless you enjoy repetitious rhymes about smoking weed and women riding my d $ * .
1	ummm if you buy it you will know i borrowed it from a friend and he never got it back ... so i bought him another
0	i should have reviewed this along with fm . both were double record hit soundtracks . both represented youth . both are excellent time capsules of what radio was playing . one was a bad movie with a great soundtrack and the other was a classic movie with a terrible soundtrack . this is the terrible soundtrack . when the best songs are by billy squier and sammy hagar you know you 're in trouble . jackson browne , joe walsh , don henley are each awful . so were the go-go 's . not surprisingly don felder and jimmy buffet both sucked . i almost fell asleep in route 128 traffic when graham nash played . the band that called themselves poco ca n't be the same poco i grew up with . there were some listenable tracks by timothy b. schmit , louise goffin and stevie nicks but then there 's quarterflash . however , amongst all this crap was a gem ... the very last song is goodbye goodbye by oingo boingo . this song rocks and danny elfman sounds crazed . unavailable anywhere else which saves this from the trash
0	as a contemporary of joan baez ( age-wise ) , i loved her early music and the power of her incredible voice . i even empathize with much of her politics , but unfortunately it 's time she rested on her laurels . her voice on this cd is quite far removed from what she was once capable of , and in fact i would have to say that there is no comparison between her vocal ability on bowery songs , and her earlier quality . like some professional athletes , she seems to not know when to quit ...
0	as much as i like most of the songs on this cd ... it 's just too short . also the production is lousy . the recording quality sounds awful in places . hopefully , the updated compilations are better . this one is not worth the money ! ! !
1	this is a great cd ! each track fades up to full volume at the start and fades down to silence at the end . this makes it nice to just play the entire cd or to loop one track since there are no sharp changes from one noise to another . so far the car and washing machine tracks seem to be our baby 's favorites . when she outgrows the need for this white noise cd , we 'll transition her to lullaby or classical music . for now though , this cd helps us keep her on a schedule and well rested by helping keep her relaxed and usually asleep during her nap times . as a bonus , the waves and rain on the roof tracks are soothing for grown-ups needing to drown out noise while they sleep
0	i bought this soundtrack in 1984 when the movie adaptation of george orwell 's book came out , simply because it was attached to the movie . i 'll try not to use any non-family words here , but this soundtrack sucks . muldowney 's original score is available on cd , and simply imagining it used as intended adds a whole new dimension to the movie . as far as this soundtrack goes , though ; skip it
0	john coltrane was villified most of his creative life for playing at the edge of a world he was helping to redefine . wynton and the lcjo are in effect the death of creative musicians like coltrane , or most of the truly creative jazz scene for that matter . wynton is establishing himself as `` the face of jazz '' . a market oriented phenomenon which freezes some of the elements making jazz without ever capturing the true essence of the music . by telling us ( and make no mistake , these guys do ... ) : `` this is what jazz is '' and trying to re-appropriate themselves the music of jazz giants such as john coltrane who , if he were alive , would not be given the time of day by these folks , wynton and his posses are raping what is true and beautiful in this music . the recording , since i must talk about it , features a set of crafty yet discomboluted arrangements merely mimicking what coltrane was , mostly empty of content , setting in motions soloists who sound more like `` jazz puppets '' than anything remotely close to what coltrane was striving for ( notable exception : ted nash ! ) . you do not need this record . wynton and the lcjo does not need your money ; spend it on musicians who put their life and their art on the edge , the way coltrane did
1	this album was so good to hear when it came out . i like every song on here but my favorites are `` still dre '' , '' the watcher '' , '' xxplosive '' , '' what 's the difference '' and `` forget about dre . those are my favorites but there a lot of other songs that people will like . recommend this album highly to rap fans . buy this album you have nothing to loose because its dre one of the best producers in the game right now so click on add to cart and be happy you hearing this classic
0	nelly could make the wort rapper sound like a lyricyst , and how dare him to diss krs-one , he just said the truth and he really did not diss him on number 1 , he just added to why he sucks . lets face it , all his songs are basically dumb and and really don , t have much texture involved . and how funny is it that his friends really have no skill and they are all over this album it is just laughable . if you buy this album , you throw away good money . unless you like bubblegum rap . this is more for a teen white girl who wants to be cool , but lets face it , its played out
1	you have not heard his voice until to have heard andras schiff play the well tempered clavie
1	stiff upper lip is a good ac/dc album , it 's not a great ac/dc album . it kills me when people say that ac/dc have sounded the same since 1973 on every album they have done . nothing could be further from the truth . i have always thought that each ac/dc album has a sound and a feel and a story in it 's own and that a track off each album would be totally out of place on another album . for instance , can you image shake a leg on stiff upper lip ? or ballbreaker on back in black ? it does n't work . stiff upper lip has its own kind of rough , bluesy feel to it . brian 's voice sounds different , the tones and the guitars sound different . it 's good but not great . the standouts ... 1 . stiff upper lip- pretty rocking song . has a good attitude . it 's fun . 2 . hold me back and ca n't stand still . very odd rolling songs . they sound a lot alike . again , these songs could never have been on back in black . i have heard that brian sang ca n't stand still in one take , that 's why they all clap at the end . i do n't know if that 's true , but it 's an interesting song . 3 . satellite blues- this one is an instant classic . i love this song . this song could have been done back in the days of back in black and if it were on that album i think it would be as popular as you shook me all night long . everything else is ho hum . not good , not bad . better than most bands out there . i am really hoping ac/dc put out a killer album with their new release , whenever that is . i hope they do n't turn into the new g and suffer from the chinese democracy syndrome
0	it seems that even the best bands have only a finite number of great melodies in them , and the flower kings exhausted theirs in their first four cds . here we have yet another double-helping of their ageless wisdom , strewn across two cds to our fiduciary detriment . though not as crass and offensive as stolt 's `` wall street voodoo '' or bodin 's `` i am '' , this is nevertheless lyrically naive to the level of silliness . there are a few good instrumental passages mixed in this release , but not enough to justify its purchase . stolt said in a recent interview something to the effect that `` ... peace love never go out of fashion ... '' well , neither does informed maturity , and you wo n't find any of that in this group 's recent output . just more utopian preaching and good vs. evil typecasting . their liner notes advocate sending money to greenpeace and amnesty international , but i would counter that any american would be better investing their extra cash at st. jude 's children 's hospital . i 'm going to sell my copy of `` paradox hotel '' , and probably several more flower kings cds , to do just that . there are some sick children out there who need our support and encouragement far more than these would-be hippies
1	this cd is dave bromberg 's best effort . playing solo allows his guitar playing capabilities to be clearly demonstrated .

0	garbage metal - music for the american mainstream to feed on . i saw them open for slayer about 4-5 years back , and they had about 5 guys on stage doing nothing except jumping up and down . how pathetic ! pick up some real metal ... . like old kreator .
1	goth meets cabaret , or rather gothic music influenced by cabaret . thats the best way to describe this wonderful little release by projekt . the eleven tracks here provide an introduction to the `` dark cabaret '' scene , and do so quite well . the first song , coin-operated boy by the dresden dolls , is a great start , and the cd continues onward to devious evil night together by jill tracy ( which sets up a wonderful film noir mood ) and on to the darker , electronic dance number cabaret fortune teller by audra , to a remix of knock three times on my coffin by projekt veterans black tape for a blue girl . along the way numerous other bands are covered . sam rosenthal 's side project revue noir makes their debut on this cd , with husky feminine vocals provided by nicki jaine , who also has a solo song ( pretty faces ) on the cd as well . personally , i loved revue noir and find nicki jaine 's voice to be quite alluring , but i also know some btfabg fans who dislike her vocals so you 've been warned . but all in all , i think anyone with a task for the dark should check out this cd . at the very least , its a cheap and decent introduction to a whole new style , and thats always a good thing
0	my wife got this cd for me because i like the music from the movie cast away . she saw the words cast away in large and prominent print . she saw the picture of tom hanks , very large . she assumed it was the soundtrack for the movie and not just the 10th track of 10 on the cd . in hindsight she should have read the entire panel on the cd . i guess the producers of this cd did n't think the rest of the music could stand on its own and so they deceptively packaged it this way figuring most people would n't waste time returning it . if you had it listed in the rate column , i would give it a negative rating instead of just the one star
0	i basically love anything mr. carter does , but this one has alot of great lyrics ( as usual ) . i 'm so glad he 's coming out of retirement . any fan of jay-z will enjoy this cd
1	this is just a great cd . whenever i need to restore inner harmony after work , or dealing with any upsetting situation , this is the one i go to . instantly i am transported to the calm , soothing setting of a traditional japanese house and garden . it is fantastic for meditation , too . let all the nonessentials of life slip away while you listen to this beautiful recording
1	i have loved the swans since my danceteria days in early 80s new york . but its a fitful , frustrating love . you get the sense from 'incandesent ' that the swans forgot to stop partying . that they never took the time to put together more than a handful of songs . oh , but what songs they were . this collection is for completists and aging post-punker ( like myself ) who wished they 'd shared a pint with the boys back when simply getting stoned was a subversive act . its a nice collection of beautiful , quirky oddities here . but a few gems are missing `` holy holy '' , `` 1982 '' , `` world of milk and blood '' come to mind . maybe on an 'ashes ' reissue . in the meantime , scoop this up . simpson company deserve the attention . if you really care about the band , buy it directly from their label , renascent . that way the company ( and the band ) can make a few pennies . maybe enough to mine the crates for a second hits collection .
1	i was looking for some music i could play in the car or around the house with my 19-month-old son and came across this one -- the exact same `` album '' that i had when i was his age ! i 'm so glad they redid it ! one of my fondest memories
1	although this sports new remastering , unless you have either the golden hits cd available here at amazon and your local cd shop , the now out of print golden celebration boxed set or the 2 volume `` patti page collection '' series ( volume 2 is also out of print ) , this is unnecessary as it duplicates every track on golden hits except for let me go lover instead of with my eyes wide open i 'm dreaming and the songs are arranged in a different order . fans are better off looking for the 2 previous out of print collections with let me go lover to obtain this track and for the rest of this stuff , either buy golden hits , the boxed set and the 2 volume patti page collection series , and btw , vol . 1 is still in print so you can order it right here at amazon
0	how can he be such an enormous talent when all he does is copy off of other people ? sorry i just cant see it . i dont think he does justice to nolan porter 's `` if i could only be sure '' on the first track at all : if you want to hear some great music listen to the original ! ! !
0	yeah , i am a big fan of moby , and accidentally buying the cd that almost ended his career does n't shake that , if you want some good moby might i suggest 18 or play , this has some quiet more ambient tracks which show some promise , but fail to build up to anything , everything else is moby screaming in a traditional punk style , which were almost humorous , except , not [ this much money ] humorous , i am not a fan of this cd , i know he was starting out in a punk band , but his other stuff is much bette
1	some musicians , like fine chefs , make it look so easy . david grisman is one of them . on the cd , `` i 'm beginning to see the light , '' the prolific mandolinist extraordinaire is joined by scottish guitar virtuoso martin taylor and veteran grisman quintet members jim kerwin and george marsh ( on bass and drums/percussion , respectively ) for one hot little album . while the song list is comprised of many well-loved standards , such as `` autumn leaves , '' `` makin ' whoopee , '' `` lover man , '' and `` cheek to cheek , '' the taylor/grisman quartet seems to have so much fun preparing its stew and adds enough incredible seasonings to the pot to make emeril shout , `` bam ! '' as don stierberg , who penned the liner notes , says : `` music need not be trendy to be great . '' i wholeheartedly agree . ( c.a . carlino
1	if you do n't love this cd ( and many people wo n't ) , then you must have a very different taste in music then me . yes , it 's different . yes , it 's offensive . yes , it 's incredibly powerful . mutiny in heaven is insanity on a disc , six strings that drew the blood is awesome , as is everything on this disc . simply brilliant , and best disc to start a birthday party obsession with
1	while i am not a big fan of john mclaughlin or mahvishnu orchestra - i can not deny that they really had something with this album.. it is something new - not just an extension of miles davis - they were breaking new territory ... there is a cohesiveness amongst the band members - of course abounding with improvisational talent - this is fushion but first of all it is music
1	if you like the beach boys and appreciate the technical quality behind telarc recordings , then this disc is a must have in your collection . first , papa doo run run does an excellent job covering beach boys tunes to the point where some people ca n't tell the difference , but you can still hear the uniqueness they bring to it . second , you 'll feel like your hearing parts of the music you 've never heard before because there is so much more foundation and clarity to the recording . you can hear each instrument clearly . the beginning of `` i get around '' is almost explosive , they way the original recording should have been . telarc and papa doo run run have made a special album here . when i feel like listening to the beach boys , i usually grab this cd first
1	though i own alot of paul desmond recordings , this one as been in the cd changer for weeks now . there 's great , gentle interplay with jim hall , and a total sound that is most enjoyable . warm and round notes make this perfect evening music which i have found pleases most everyone
0	i am a cellist of 15 years on the breakthrough of becoming a renowed cellist . this cellist tone is so powerfull and clear.she tells a story this is so clear to understand because the music speaks . alisa should watch the slurs from the f to b and be more gracefull . the apres un reve was ok i guess . she really should of tooken more time . like floating on a dream cloud . when i play this piece i take the music from the begining as a fuzzy dream and play the pitch so the music tells a story and becomes more clear every measure . the elgar is somenthing she might not want to touch because no one plays it better than du pre
0	i love love tegan and sara and when i found out this was one of their favorite cds i have to admit ... .i think i was devastated . i just saw pretty girls make graves last night and they really could not have sounded worse.not just not enjoyable ... unbelieveably horrible . i think you should take your money and spend it on a cd that actually sounds like good music . do n't make your ears go through this much pain
1	quite different from his later big-band recordings . some of the songs that you may find on wes ' 'best of ' collections sound too much like elevator music . not so with this debut album . a drummer , a organist , and a guitar player ; no horn section . stripped down in the sence of band size but very deep and articulate playing . he shows of his trade mark octave playing , his chord solos ( played over the organs rythm chords none the less ) , and flashy runs across the fret board when needed . a good cd to start with for the guitarist who wants to play jazz .
0	many albums , including this one , have the problem that all the songs pretty much sound the same ; but this also has the troublesome problem of music that is too easy on the ears and that never gets very exciting - except for the first two tracks . the use of many poetry elements in their lyrics ca n't save the blandness of the music . `` what about everything '' and `` life less ordinary '' are good songs . the rest pretty much sound the same and will put you to sleep .
1	i 'll have to accept that even tough i 'm not a great fan of this band they have impressed me with this new release , the lyrics are in some cases very deep and in songs like evil angel they can touch you right there . for me the band has progressed a lot and you can tell that in this album , it 's very melodic and more mature . also the acoustic version of `` the diary of jane '' is amazing . i personally recommend the songs `` breath '' , `` evil angel '' and my favorite `` dance with the devil ''
0	if you like early priest , buy genocide . it has both rocka rolla and sad wings of destiny in their entirety ( the only thing it does not have is the original album artwork ) . not leaving out important tracks like the ripper , for pete 's sake ! ! ! how could you leave out the ripper ? and what about island of domination ? i feel sorry for anyone that bought this that is unfamiliar with priest . they got jipped and did n't even know it . these are my favorite albums by priest and i hate to see them butchered like this ... and what about the order of the songs ? why would they mess with that too ? do youself a favor and buy either genocide , or if you like to have the original artwork , buy rocka rolla and sad wings of destiny seperately
1	i got the pleasure of seeing albert open for bb king . unfortunately for bb king , because once albert started playing his flying v , with blues power , he demoralized anybody that came after him . he had the entire universal amphitheater standing . and stayed standing for most of his show . blues power is one of his best . get , listen , and then really listen . because you can feel your skin crawl with extacy from those notes..
1	with his snarling , gritty guitar tones , swampy grooves , and scratchy vocals , c.c . adcock makes butt-shakin ' music that blends rockabilly , old-school memphis r , new orleans funk , cajun dancehall tunes , and juke-joint blues . he 's young , but no poseur : having paid dues with bo diddley and buckwheat zydeco , adcock knows rootsy textures like the back of his hand . but despite the tremolo guitar and slapped upright bass , this is n't a retro-sounding record . adcock and his various producers bring a hip sonic edge to the music that keeps the moods fresh and the vibe ominous . doyle bramhall joins adcock on two songs , and together they raise 6-string hell . boasting richly layered guitars and heaps of attitude , adcock 's music is soulful , somewhat twisted , and deeply satisfying

1	this is what music is all about , the emotion in a simple legato trumpet note , or the raspy , delicious vibrato of vocalist david sylvian ; it makes me melt and feel so good and pure . think if tweaker were to make jazz -- and really chill out -- this is what it would sound like . you 'll never hear a sweeter sounding clarinet , ever . there is everything one could want . possibly the perfect record . it 's jazzy and cinematic and the double bass throughout is enough to make anyone melt and feel the emotion of the music course through their soul . absolutely brilliant and definitely essential . one of my favorites from the year .
0	2nd time .
1	my son loves music and really likes dan zanes . we started with the videos on disney and the `` catch that train '' song really got us singing , so we ordered this cd . now my son sings along with it , dances and jumps around . dan zanes really is fun for the family
1	this is one of his best cd 's . you really have to listen to the words on the cd , he takes you to whole another level . he is one of the best r singers ever , just close your eyes and listen to the song `` maybe '' and think of that special place for you and your lady
0	generally on amazon.com , the average rating of an album does not accurately indicate its quality - that is , the albums are usually highly overrated . this is probably due to the voluntary nature of the reviews and the fact that the fans of an artist are far more likely to review their albums and give them high scores than a casual music listener giving them the score they deserve . as a result of this , generally , albums that have an average score of 4.5 - 5 stars are usually excellent albums . ones with a score of 4 are generally good and 3.5 indicates a pretty average album . average scores any lower than 3.5 stars generally indicate a pretty poor album . as i mentioned before , due to the high proportion of fans reviewing albums , the average score rarely falls below 3 stars . it takes a pretty horrendous album , like limp bizkit 's results may vary , to get a score of even 2.5 . in fact , i did n't even think that it was possible for an album to get less than 2.5 - that is , until i saw this pile of feces . now to put this average score of 2 into context - this means that the proportion of `` hataz '' reviewing this album is even more than the proportion of fans reviewing it . out of all the terrible albums i have viewed , i have never seen this happen before . not even to bands as terrible as limp bizkit or even an*l c*nt . this obviously indicates a decline in fan numbers and , hopefully , the end of chingy 's 15 minutes of fame
0	while the title cut with joe public was bumping most of this disc is so-so & amp ; formula driven.without teddy riley the grooves & amp ; vibe are n't as strong
1	feinstein is in love with the gershwins and that passion is never made clearer than in pure gershwin . michael 's love affair with ira 's lyrics , his reckless abandon to the light-hearted spirit of the familiar -- and lesser known -- phrases , more than makes up for the less polished vocal production in this early album . in fact , it is that very element that sells these songs as i 've never heard them elsewhere . michael pulls out all stops , embracing the less-than-lily-white additional verses of `` embraceable you '' , with the unbridled passion of a first time lover . his duet with rosie clooney arrouses my curiosity about the movie in which this unknown number made its debut . what a delightful approach michael demonstrates throughout ... . oh , to be that young and exuberant about life , love and music again
0	yo nu-mixx sux i hate when people make cd 's like this to make some money off of great artist like pac . this cd is disrespecting pac and nobody should get this if your a pac fan . they take great songs and make crappy beats . get this if you want to support pac haters or waste your money
0	i found a supposedly `` new remastered edition '' of sade 's `` diamond life '' on sale for less than 10 bucks . oops ! great mistake ! when i tried to return it , the cd store was already out of business , and the copy is one issued in the netherlands which is marked into the booklet as `` 2000 digital remastered version '' . the whole album has been re-recorded with new arrangements ! the digital sound is quite good , but the new arrangements made for 'smooth operator ' really sucks ! !
0	i remember really liking this album when it was first released , even though i could tell it was not in the same league as the real thing or angel dust . listening to the album now , i realise it is by far the worst fnm album since mike patton joined . the whole album feels very rushed , it has a sparse , raw sound , very different to angel dust 's polish . the music is generally very simple with many tracks sounding like b-sides and lacks the consistent melodiousness and sense of rhythm of their previous two classic albums . it was a shame to see guitarist jim martin depart . he had an unmistakable style and crunching guitar sound and was an integral part of fnm 's style and make up . however , being replaced ( for a short time anyway ) by trey spruance is no bad thing - anyone familiar with his work with mr bungle will know he is a genius with a guitar and his work here on king for a day is excellent , it 's just a shame that the material he has to work with is largely uninspired . how ironic then that on such a disappointing album , fnm produce one of their greatest ever tracks - the title track is pure genius , full of the care and effort , rhythm and melodiousness fnm were famous for . beginning with a great bass riff and acoustic strum , it is soon joined by a gentle female voice effect and simple minor piano scale and then brilliantly builds into a tour de force of percussion and guitar work before cleverly returning to the gentle acoustic sounds of the intro where it carefully takes 2 and a half minutes to wind down beautifully - this is fnm as you 'd expect them . another track that deserves special mention is cuckoo or caca , a great metal piece with excellent percussion and keyboards and crazy vocals . it 's scorching and funy and another reminder of the greatness fnm once held in abundance . it 's just a shame that these moments of inspiration are surrounded by so much surprising blandness ( caralho voador , take this bottle , the last to know ) and 2nd rate metal ( ugly in the morning , what a day , get out ) . star a.d. could have been vintage fnm but in the end falls flat , evidence starts off interestingly enough but soon gets boring and metal tracks like ricochet , the gentle art of making enemies and digging the grave are simple and sound like what most student bands are writing . however , the album does end on another note of vintage fnm - just a man is funny and catchy with patton having fun doing his tom jones impression and the inclusion of a gospel choir at the end is inspired - you find yourself not wanting it to end . patton 's vocals throughout the album are still amazing but should be accompanying much better material and you ca n't help but feel he was a little bored here - i think his heart always really lay with the far superior mr bungle , where he really shone and where his voice was absolutely perfect for the complex and avant garde material . i suppose it 's not surprising that king for a day is a largely empty affair , the departure of jim martin and the diminished presence of roddy bottum at rehearsals meant that fnm 's original chemistry and resources were sadly lacking and so were unable to achieve what they once had been able to . it 's really an album for faith no more fans , it 's certainly no classic despite some classic material and i feel it was the beginning of the end for fnm , they would improve with their next album , album of the year - but only marginally .
0	i own this set , as does my roomate , and we both hate it . it highlights bands like 'red lorry , yellow lorry ' that no one likes or listens to , and uses great classic bands like bauhaus ' worst song as the first track . it is the hollow , tin-y , embarrassingly hokey side of goth , and i am ashamed to even have it in my house
0	on an episode of seinfield that is probably overexposed enough as it is , the always wily and oh so goofy character of kramer is playing a game of risk and exclaims that the `` ukraine is weeeeak '' . this causes him to get a thorough scolding and a little bit of trouble . i think the same basic sentiments work with this new order release . it probably was n't worth the ungodly long eight year wait although it produced the excellent `` rock the shack '' and of course `` crystal '' , which i 'll get back to later . unlike kramer i feel i can make this statement safely as i 'm not dealing with a burly , alcohol swigging ukranian , but new order fans , which are n't the most intimidating bunch out there . keyboardist gillian gilbert is not here as she felt taking care of her kids is more important , which it is , maybe . this album features the guitar of billy corgan , the frontman of the seminal 90 's group soundgarden . too bad they could n't get billy to collaborate five years earlier because at this point he was already full blown crazy , and was n't writing very good material or really using his guitar , at all . new order also made the mistake of having corgan to backing vocals . now a synth is high pitched and shrill enough , but to top that off with a billy corgan squealing like a pig cherry is probably not the best choice . so ... someone like you is more or less unlistenable . it has some pretty terrible lyrics about how bernard does n't want to wash his car . now i can relate , i would n't want to wash my car in britain since it rains all the time and would probably be an altogether futile affair , but this topic does n't result in the most captivating and well-written material . new order occasionnally want to rawk out with guitars on this album , something they do n't do very often , just like van morrison . now i 'm not sure if i 've heard a van morrison song but i 've always figured it was a give that they rawk out with guitars . case in point of this `not so good of an idea rawking ' is rock the shack . rock the shack kind of sounds like new order 's take on someone commissioned to write an epic gilligan 's island rock song , pretty amazing huh ? '60 miles an hour ' , `primitive notion ' , and `close range ' all suffer from being a little too vanilla and a little too bland . new order have patches here where they sound like they might be suffering from the same middle-aged blandness that has crippled other 80 's artist like depeche mode , the cure , and tears for fears ( who 've actually always blown ) . however , they do succeed fully well on two songs here . there is `crystal ' , which is truly an excellent rock song and show new order can succeed with a harder guitar edge and is probably one of the two or three best songs of new order 's career from the 90 's and beyond . how this did n't get more airplay than it did is a mystery to me , because it has the alternative rock of today written all over it . the other is run wild which is really a great little slow song , in the vein of `as it is when it was . probably new order 's only full-fledged ballad it serves as a fitting acoustic , moving ending to an otherwise disappointing album . get ready is good beginning and end , just not end between . kind of like that movie twin peaks : fire walk with me
1	the sundays come out with a cd once a decade , thus putting me in constant cravings for new material . though camera obscura is very original and very much their own band , they satisfy the cravings that only harriet wheeler could touch . truly vast and intimate at the same time , and a voice that speaks to something very deep , sad and lovely inside you
0	i thought it would have nice , soft songs . but , it is riddled with annoying sound effects and strange instrumentation
0	after carefully researching as many rain recordings as possible on amazon and reading all reviews i had hoped i had made a good choice with this cd . unfortunately i discovered that not only is the recording looped about every 60 seconds but there is an unmistakable low frequency rumble that is very apparent listening though my 5.1 system and my bose tri-port headphones . as a recording engineer i recognize this to most likely be a truck or car passing by and passing the sound up through the microphone stands that were obviously not de-coupled from the ground . the bottom line is i hear this rumble each and everytime i start to relax and it renders the cd completely useless to me . the recording is otherwise a good one and the stereo image presented seems authentic . since nobody else has complained of this rumble , i will assume that it will only bother someone with a trained ear
1	growing up with classical rock and having enjoyed rock music by rod stewart , i did n't think i 'd like this cd . one evening i was having dinner at a friend 's home and they had this one playing . it was beautiful . being a little older now ( in my early 40 's ) , i enjoy more mellow music than the head banging variety that is heard now . this cd of rod 's was nostalgic , romantic and extremely easy to listen to .
1	... and if you 're fortunate enough to find it , i recommend buying the version with the bonus dvd , which chronicles the making of yellow brick road . when i bought it , it cost the same as the 2 sacd set without the dvd , so it was still a great deal . my only complaint -- and it 's really minor -- is that it would have been nice if they could have fit the original album onto a single sacd . a second disc could have included the bonus tracks that are included in this package , plus any extra -- maybe even audio-only interviews -- still remaining in the vaults . no matter . the important thing , if you are able , is to make sure you have an sacd-compatible player ( like the pioneer dv-563a , or one of the really expensive players if you 've got the cash and love audiophile formats in both your hardware and your cds ) . even if you do n't , the stereo cd layer still sounds truly excellent
0	neither the amazon review or any of the customer reviews recently submitted mention this fact . i have few classical and pop recordings in mono that do not impact the listening experience such as 'songs for swinging lovers ' - frank sinatra or beethoven 's opera fidelio - conductor otto klemperer ( testament label ) . the material on these recordings are so good that the listener completely ignores the fact that they are mono recordings . i did not hear anything outstanding on this cd to make me overlook the 'mono ' factor . is this some great jazz masterpiece , recorded live in carnegie hall by two giants of jazz ? i personally do n't think so . somehow this material remained in obscurity for all this time and somebody by accident discovered this gem - if you believe that then elvis is alive and the earth is exactly 6000 years old . with small jazz bands , i like to listen to the musicians communicate with each other within the context of a thesis . examples : 'sunday at the village vanguard - bill evans trio ' or 'new york reunion - mccoy tyner quartet ' . i wanted to but could not hear anything of this sort in this recording . this material is more likely to be understood only by the performers themselves and the real jazz aficionados . it may have been hasty but after one listen i decided to sell this cd and i have no regrets other than buying it in the first place .
1	only 2 words can describe this great cd and they are ( simply incerdible ) im only 17 but i know great oldschool when i hear it and this is fantastic musi
0	oh , this is pure adult garbage all right . i have never heard a more disguisting piece of music then this , then again the movie was garbage also
1	martina mcbride 's `` emotion '' album contains many pop country elements , but is still nonetheless a great album . here 's how i rate each song . ( out of a 5 star scale ) 1 ) do what you do- good song , but takes a little to get used to . ( 4 stars ) 2 ) anything 's better than feeling the blues- good songs , good lyrics . ( 4 stars ) 3 ) i love you- great song , martina 's most successful song on the country charts , spending 5 weeks in the top spot . ( 5 stars ) 4 ) make me believe- great song about whether one 's love is true or not ... . i love the lyric `` but it 's hard to start a fire without a spark ( 5 stars ) 5 ) love 's the only house- this song will draw a strong connection to your heart . the song is spectacular and speaks the truth ... love is truly the only house big enough for all the world 's pain . the video to this song is very touching as well . go martina ! ( 5 stars ) 6 ) there you are- a perfect wedding song ... she hold the `` are '' note for at least 12+ seconds near the end . ( 5 stars ) if you hear this song live , she holds the note 15 seconds ! ! ! ! ( so live this song will be 6 stars/5 stars ! ! ! ! ) 7 ) it 's my time- the first song that i ever heard martina perform live in the ama awards ... she rocked the house down with this song ... she also holds a 10 second note at this song . love that range of hers . ( 5 stars ) 8 ) i ai n't goin ' nowhere- i like this song and its message about being there for a significant other . ( 5 stars ) 9 ) anything and everything- the lyrics and martina 's gentle vocal performance on this song are perfection . ( 5 stars ) 10 ) from the ashes- another standout song on this album . she holds some high notes in this one too . ( 5 stars ) 11 ) goodbye- a solid performance , i llike how martina goes lower and softer in some parts of the song . ( 4 stars ) 12 ) this uncivil war- the best song on the album ! ! ! ! amazing ! ! ! ! written by gretchen , the writer of martina 's career hit `` indepedence day . '' a very emotional song , which defines the title of the album . the ending is a real treat as well . ( 6 stars ! ) this album is definitely worth purchasing ! ! ! it helps complete my collection of martina 's albums
0	as long as artists keep making albums with only one good song , people will keep getting them for free in internet . nestor keeps insisting in doing instrumental hip hop , pop , commercial , elevator music . if you like that kind of music , buy this cd , otherwise buy hubert laws , or dave valentin among others . if you want to listen to good nestor music , buy `` morning ride '' , `` dance of the phoenix '' , `` talk to me '' , `` mi alma latina '' or the charanga album `` mis canciones primeras '' . sorry nestor , i am a big fan of your music but you are wasting your talent doing this kind of stuff . when do you plan to make a good non commercial latin jazz album
1	her voice takes my breath away , i fell in love with her . i highly reccomend it
1	linkin park are still together and they are making their next album , it is due out eairly next year . mike just did this for fun . look into things a little more buddy before you start saying things . oh yeah , and if you like good hip-hop , you 'll like this album . give it a shot . you dont have to be a linkin park fan to enjoy this record , since its nothing like lp . peace
1	this album is the foudation of modern hip hop ... the format of the album the presence of rakim ... .his image everything was new territory when this album came out in 86 ' all hip hop lovers should have this album especially people down south
1	i ca n't believe the harshness of some of the comments on this album . not a lot of in between among the notices -- those that hate are mean and heartless . very hurtful . lousy counterpoint to her warmth . i do n't think they understand that she does n't have to lose control to be meaningful and touching . take her as an original instead of as a mimic . what do i hear ? i love her lush voice on this album and fred hersch 's brilliant piano accompaniment . bill frisell is very good , too . i love jazz pop as well as opera . ren ? e fleming can make it any of these genres . these songs are very much her own interpretation . they are 'deeper ' than what you 've heard before . even if i prefer nancy wilson or eva cassidy singing `` you 've changed , '' ren ? e fleming sings it warmly and beautifully , in her own style , and very touching , too . she 's not carried by full orchestration , mostly just fred and her . i was going to write that `` my one and only love '' was especially good , but as the cd kept playing , i must say that they are all especially good . enjoy
1	i do not own this cd , but i recently saw the doctor at a local jazz club and was blown away . he had a good sense of humor and was very worldly . he would ascend and spiral upwords untill every one in the club 's heart rate had spead up 100 notches ... and boom ... he was back to being relaxed old lonnie . at the break i met him , and got an autograph . he was very insightful musical and with spoken words.i would reccomend seeing him live , aswell as buying his album
0	ok i 'll make it short but sweat great music , singing sucks ... this guy is flat every song and he should go back to the honk tonk and get away from rock ... if you think i 'm lying listen close how can anyone listen to this voice , he ca n't hold a note and sounds like he has a mouth full of mush , he sucked at country and has no place in rock ... home boy go back to texas and get back to branded some cows cause you suck
0	this is the perfect cd for taking a nap to . it 's mostly full of slow pop and rock . if you 're a fan of this type of music , i recommend this cd , but if not , do n't buy it . there are only a few good tracks . all star , bad reputation , i 'm a believer , stay home . and i do n't enjoy buying a cd that only 1/3 of it is good . so , i would n't buy it , if i were you .
0	if you have children that are five years younger , this would be a good album to put in your child 's boom box or get it in cassette for their tape player . but if your children are six and up . your better off finding the real songs and burning them if you can find these songs . this album should be saved strictly for the poor folks who wnat music for their kids but can not afford it . this ablum would be number 1 if it were sold in rwanda , sudan or other third world nations since it could be sold for like dirt cheap . parents , if you buy this album , after your children turn 6 years old . pack this cd and other ki8dz bop cd 's and send them to africa . this is pop music for impoverished folks
1	having read some of the reviews here i just thought i should mention that for those who enjoy punk rock music rather than the sameness of most emo music these days they should definitely check out this band ! while the singer ( conor oberst ) does have that emo voice so familiar to many other bands , he utilises it well and his conviction can be heard throughout ( unlike a band like taking back sunday ) the music is uplifting without being soppy or sentimental , the lyrics are refreshingly different from most punk-politics band and do n't come across as just the singer throwing a badly worded hissy fit . if you want to feel sorry for youself go listen to bright eyes , if you want to do something about it listen to desaparecidos
1	this band reminds me of the thrill i first got when i listened to an atreyu album . it dies today rip off the former bands style , but they are still a very good band . in the over-crowded metalcore market of today , that is a rarity . my only complaint , is that the vocalist has a beautiful singing voice ( as heard on `` the radiance ) , but more often then not goes for the screams and growls that are associated with this type of music . still 5/5 material though . favorite songs : `` the radiance , '' `` freak gasoline fight , '' `` our disintigration , '' and : the caitliff choir : defeatism
1	a very proud and highly recommended production , it 's a real pitty this cd is not available , i still have this one as a precious thing , i hear it all the time as well as i want . nobody will forget jeff lynne as an excellent musician , ever
0	rob touches on so much with this cd . my favorite song is one that has n't got any airplay and , in my opinion , the public missed out a great hit ! `` streetcorner symphony '' is about people coming together . it 's what i call my happy song . each day as i go to work i play the song as loud as i can get it ! we , my daughters and i , saw him live and he also called it a happy song ! i ca n't wait for his live albulm to come out ! there are fast and slow songs on this cd and will be worth every penny you spend to buy it ! incredible voice and songwritting
1	its quite difficult to sum up the impact of this cd with few mere words . suffice to say , level 1 is a timeless classic , in fact , it was my entry pass into the realm of d-n-b . logical progressions level 1 is a must-have for all d-n-b heads & amp ; music lovers in general . demon 's theme , western , danny 's song & amp ; horizons remain some of my favorite songs in any genre . bukem 's level 1 displays his flawless production & amp ; track mastery which cascades the listener with the ideal mid-tempo balance between dance-floor adrenaline & amp ; ambient bliss
1	what has happened to the song `` lives in the balance '' on this set ? if you go to his website it sounds really great ! ! ! on this set it sounds awfull ! ! it sounds as if he was in a really big hurry to get the song over with . the packaging if you could call it that is really lame . foam dots for holders ? what do you do when those fall off ? i suppose you put the cd 's in jewel cases or else they will get really scratched up . not to mention it is missing some of his greatest work ! true you do get alot of songs for the money but , there should have been more time planning this set out before actually producing it . if you own an i-pod i suggest you go to apples i-tunes web page and import the great songs this set is missing as well as the others you really like off of this set and you will probably have spent the same amount of money if not less
0	i have not heard of or listened to , this cd series , but from the sound of it , its all bad interpretations of popular music . i just want to say that if you want your kids to listen to music and you want to steer clear of the bad stuff ... play classical music . play stuff without lyrics . play a show on tv where the characters sing . do anything but , buy a cd where people that are n't the original artists sing songs that were never intended to be for kids in the first place . censoring a song or cutting lyrics tends to ruin that song . there are just some songs that are n't good for kids even if you cut out all the bad words . think about this ... do you really want your kids coming up to you later in their life after hearing the real version of a song and asking you why the song they heard as a kid is so different from the one they just heard on the radio and then having to explain to them that the song they heard as a kid was a clean version of the song ? listen ... i 'm all for trying to keep your kids away from inappropriate stuff for as long as possible , but cds like this are not the way to go . all they do is make kids think that all music is going to sound just like the music on the cds and when they finally hear the real stuff , they 're gon na be asking questions . do them and yourself a favor and do n't buy these cds
0	forget the fact that despite the grumbling about today 's `` music '' too many people just swallow and digest the slop record companies throw at them , `` hollaback girl '' is the absolute dumbest `` song '' i 've ever had the displeasure to hear . there are two main parts to this travesty : 1 . where she says `` that 's my sh** '' no less than a million times , and 2 . she demonstrates that she 's hooked on phonics by being kind enough to spell bananas for the rest of us . if this is supposed to be rap , stefani failed miserably . if it 's supposed to be dance , again , she failed miserably . to be honest , i do n't know what the hell this is supposed to be because it sure is n't music . the fact that it was number one for so long proves that perhaps people do n't have any requirements for their ears . - donna di giacom
0	if you want the original recordings , do n't purchase any volume of television 's greatest hits . i 've had better luck recording the songs off of my tv with a cassette tape recorder and then dehissing them on my pc . these collections have sterile sounding fake stereo recordings of `` the beverly hillbillies '' and `` the munsters '' that just do n't sound right to me . if the original recordings do n't matter to you , then you may like this cd
1	joan . you do n't love me . because i 'm a guy . but i have loved you since 1976 . ok so i 'm an old man ( age 43 ) . so what . she 's just the best rock and roll female on the planet . i like the young ones like sahara hotnights and the donnas as well but they just do n't measure up to joan born to be bad jett . this album - like most of her other albums - consists of a mix of old and new songs . does n't mattar . i love it . and the video ... well it confirms what we have always known . not that it matters . the music matters
1	really nothing on this is bad . the best imho is rubyhorse , the brian jonestown massacre and the subways but a case could be made for any of the songs . the only problem is now i have 8 other cds i need to buy
0	it was awful ! the reproduction of the music was grainy , scratchy and virtually impossible to listen to
1	although each track is beautiful in it 's own way , it 's their sum that makes this such an incredible album in my mind . where felt mountain remained rather mellow and etheral thruought the entire album , black cherry offers more in the way of diverse melodies and tempo . the tracks seem to be placed specifically in a way that makes the album feel like a journey , and , personally , like a lay 's potato chip , not able to listen to just one ... .yeah , i need the whole thing..
0	i wo n't go into a long diatribe . suffice it to say that when i listened to this upon its release earlier this year , i was disappointed . i gave it a few more close listens and find that the musical quality is not great . this is more a photo of dylan as a free-spirit . there 's a point where baez messes up a song . ( i do n't have anything against baez . that being said , i do n't have much for her either . ) there 's joking and laughing , but really , i do n't need a double-disk of acoustic material that seems to be performed by someone who sounds like he 'd rather be in the audience than performing . you can almost sense why dylan went electric in this concert . the bootlegs prior to this are superior and i would suggest that if you are n't a die-hard dylan fan to stick with them . if you really like dylan 's acoustic work and not his electric stuff , you should be pleased with this double-disc . i love dylan , but not enough to enjoy this over and over again . i 'll go to disk one of the 4th bootleg for my acoustic fix
0	generally harmless , except for one very offensive song about siblings that hate each other and hate their parents . the song is probably funny to ultra-sophisticated , cynical adults . but the song is totally inappropriate for a four year old . i would n't bring this cd into your house
1	i wore out my tape of cypress . afoot is great , but cypress is amazing . i bought this while stationed in the army . there were n't too many `` new wave '' tapes available at the px , and i was n't going to listen to def leppard or bon jovi . so i bought cypress . one of those rare tapes that i bought 20 years ago and still listen to every few months ( the jam 's snap and setting sons , and the smith 's hatful of hollow are 3 other tapes i never tired of ) . get this cd . get it now ! it is great . thanks for reissuing it .
0	this soundtrack does not have all the songs in it from the movie . i was looking for two from the movie , and the soundtrack did not have them . like , a song by michelle branch that is in the movie is not in there . bo
0	to much guitar , drowns out all the other instruments . survivor was made famous by heavy keyboards and drums , not guitars . i was expecting another burning heart , is this love , high on you . no songs on this albums have that sound . the vocals by jamison are top notch , but none of the songs sound like the survivor i remember . survivor guitars were only there to complement the keyboards , bass and drums , not drive the whole song . i guess jim peterik was the man behind survivor all along . i give the cd 2 stars for fire makes steel , the rest are throw aways . ***recommended for die hards only*** i highly recommend 'when seconds count ' for anyone getting started with survivor
1	with all the recent praise heaped on smile , orange crate art still remains largely under-recognized and under-appreciated . sure , smile was supposed to be this grand copelandesque landscape of america , from plymouth rock to the grand cooley dam . but for my money brian and van dyke parks did it so much better with orange crate art . having written , what everyone unanimously agrees to be the most california of all anthems , fun fun fun , i get around and california girls , brian turns his attention to a california not of hot rods and surf , but of sun drenched valleys rich with citrus and vine . here wilson and parks celebrate and pay homage to the likes of jack london and john steinbeck . and if all this were not enough , we 're treated to my hobo heart , a latter day van dyke parks / michael hazelwood masterpiece . there 's also the lovely palm tree moon , a dreamy little ode to a moonlit beach , territory not unfamiliar to brian . and summer in monteray is so unabashedly nostalgic it would even make clint eastwood blush . if you have n't become familiar with this so very underated collection yet , you really ca n't call yourself a brian wilson / van dyke parks fan until you give this one a fair shot . you might even find yourself humming sail away or hold back time while in the shower . i know i did
1	this is lovely stuff . the other reviews say why much better than i can , but i just had to add to the adoration
0	i got this cd because i loved their radio hits `` bring me to life '' and `` my immortal . '' while those songs are beautiful , they are not representative of the rest of the album . although i tried and tried to get into this cd , the hard rock teen goth style just is n't my cup of tea , and the lyrics are too depressing . if you are a fan of bands such as linkin park or seether , you might enjoy this . however , if you only like `` my immortal '' and `` bring me to life '' because of amy 's powerful vocals , you 'd be better off listening to tori amos or sarah mclachlan .
0	this disc is bad ! ! ! right at the 2 '' mark the sound of the `` rock water '' is join by what sounds like a slow draining bathtub . this sound is more or less present throughout the entire hour . other discs of this type that i 've heard do n't do this
1	like i said i would , i finally got around to purchasing this cd . i especially like tracks 9-12 . cheap trick is solid as always . i have been a long time fan and enjoy all their releases . if i do have any criticism at all , it is the fact that some songs sound like recycled trick riffs . i guess it 's hard to create new stuff after 30+ years . anyway , there are some great tunes on this . buy it like i did !
1	i was looking for a cd that i could listen to all of the time . oh my god , i am breathless . i was brought to tears as they sang `` mama '' . my mother passed away in 2002 and i never got a chance to say thank you and this song said it all . all of il divo 's songs have touched me in a way that no one else could . thank you for touching my heart . i really recommend that you give this cd a chance . all of these other people on the board that gave it a low score , obviously need a hearing aid and a heart . blessing
1	his playing on this album reminds me of that of bill evans . i am glad to see on reading all the reviews that someone else had that exact thought . comparison to bill evans is the best compliment i know how to give
1	i have only recently become a country music fan . i was n't sure i would like faith hill , but this was the first cd of hers i purchased . from the very first song `` this kiss , '' i was instantly drawn into her music . what i love about her songs is that they are so real . `` you give me love '' is so real and so strong . it 's nice to hear a song that a woman sings about a man who is crying for a change . `` the secret of life '' has taken some getting used to . it is not my absolute favorite on the cd . `` me '' is the song that means the most to me since i have experienced trying to change for someone else in a relationship . and `` i love you '' is a heart-jerker for those who have loved someone from afar . she has a big voice , and she nails each song on this cd . give it a try
0	the most untalented producer in the business . honestly the only tracks that shine is all the ones with biggie and black rob 's only one hit . the rest of this is trash . especially those chickenheads total . and once again puff tryin to eat off biggie carcass . dont give this bum anymore money , just listen to biggies two gems and `` f '' the rest
1	once she has won your heart , you will want this collection to hear how she developed as a performer -- and came to be a great symbol of france in the 20th centur
0	i remember this album well ; you could hardly call it a 'barnstormer ' , as it was released well before `` under the bridge '' made them the bandwagon band of the year , but nothing could hide the fact that this was a band hellbent on proving the critics right -- they never had a good album . for every song worth listening to ( `` suck my kiss '' , `` give it away '' ) , there were at least four more songs that should have been discarded . this album was and remains a perfect example of why bands should n't feel obliged to slam 50 minutes of crap onto a slab of aluminum just because they can . on top of that , the vocals were pitched and pro-tooled beyond belief . some friends and i got a chance to see the band when they were supporting this album , and kiedis was so off-key , it was n't funny . they drowned their sound in reverb so to try and drown out his lousy vocals , but the damage was done . people were walking out in droves
1	this collection of italian cello sonatas by the great janos starker is one of the most delightful chamber albums i own . the world renowned cellist was joined on this 1966 recording by pianist stephen swedish on five of the selections , and by his frequent collaborator gyorgy sebok on the bach sonata in g minor , which was recorded in 1963 and added to this collection to increase its length ( it is a welcome addition musically too ) . the selections here range from famous composers like bach , boccherini and vivaldi , to the lesser known corelli , locatelli and valentini . for me , the common thread of this recording is the passionate performances of starker . whether it is the happy bounce of the vivaldi allegro , the sublime rendering of the boccherini adagio , or the precise interplay with sebok on the bach sonata , starker plays masterfully and his cello is captured in rich , full sound by the mercury living presence recording technique . this is an excellent purchase for all cello enthusiasts
0	the cd is great ! ! ! the legendary johnny cash comes thru loud and clear on this cd . however , it took amazon over 30 days to deliver this item and that was only after numerous emails to them . their attitude of `` just wait a few more days and email us again '' was both insulting and annoying . thank goodness this was n't a christmas gift for someone .
1	del the funky homosapien has been my favorite mc for years , and this album does n't dissapoint . the dvd is raw , and packs in lots of live footage , interviews , and is well produced . if you are a fan of del , you know you have to pick this up .
1	i love this soundtrack ! it stands alone as beautiful , haunting , alluring , and innocent -- just as griet herself was in the film . desplat perfectly captured the spirit of the story , enhanced and deepened a plot that was less than stellar . scarlett johanssen 's acting is superb , as well as essie davis and colin firth . the story , though , was a bit tired -- pretty housemaid/jealous wife/do-nothing husband . its portrayal of vermeer and his wife was a disservice to the real people , even though it is a fictionalized account . the two best tracks on this album are 'griet 's theme ' and 'colours in the clouds ' . while i 'm not keen on seeing the film again , this soundtrack is a treasure . it 's a real work of art , second only to vermeer 's work
1	it would be easy to say that this is the single greatest performance of the mahler eighth ever recorded ; i believe it is . but it would be difficult to say that and have it mean something , because after experiencing this colossal achievement , the competition ( including , alphabetically , abbado , bernstein , chailly , haitink , horenstein , kubelik , nagano , olson [ colorado mahlerfest ] , solti , and tennstedt , among others ) suddenly seemed far less impressive than they once had . what sets this mahler eighth so far apart from virtually every other is its sense of ecstasy ; of a transcendent vision being communicated , of a religious fervor . mahler had an extraordinary plan in putting together what he considered his most important work , such that he could bring us to the brink and say , `` there . it 's out there . you ca n't see it , but you can divine it '' ( and call `` it '' what you will : `` god '' or `` love '' or some all-embracing power outside of ourselves ) . most performances miss the mark , then , in one of two ways : by remaining resolutely earthbound or by trying to capture that vision in terms we can understand . the problem , of course , is that if we can understand it , it 's no longer a vision , it 's something mundane . in the closing pages of wit 's extraordinary ( and that word , as well as any other , hardly begins to do it justice ) performance you become aware of that vision existing just beyond your comprehension . you know it 's there only because you 're willing to take that leap of faith . and that 's what i mean when i say he brings the piece a sense of religious fervor . there is nothing dogmatic about the kind of religion i 'm referring to here . so let 's look at the basic components of the performance , element by element : the sound : spectacularly natural and all-encompassing . the soloists emerge from the overall sonic image like members of the orchestra , and the chorus , orchestra , and organ blend to perfection . the soloists : to a letter the finest group i have ever heard . there 's a distinctly slavic sound that seems altogether appropriate given mahler 's bohemian roots , and a refreshing lack of self-importance . no operatic grandstanding here . and for the first time ever i felt as though i was missing something by not following the words ( no libretto is provided , though it is available online and can be found easily enough elsewhere ) because everyone sounded like they cared dearly about what they were singing . they were n't going through the motions , making pretty sounds . they had something imperative to communicate and wanted us to know it . to be honest , part ii has often bored me to tears ( with chailly 's performance being particularly offensive in this regard ) but here i was literally on the edge of my seat throughout , impatient to hear what ( and who ) came next . and throughout it all , so importantly , there was a sense of spiritual ascent from beginning to end . the choruses : easily the best i 've ever heard . the way they rip into `` hostem repellas longius '' with their shrieks in the great double fugue of part i is unforgettable , and the fugue itself , which has never reminded me more of the `` rabble '' section from the first movement of mahler 's third , literally had my spine tingling throughout its entire course . that 's nothing . i got chills right at the beginning of the chorus mysticus and six and a half minutes later they had not abated ! i have never experienced anything like that before . ever . and i do n't just mean while listening to music . the conductor : what can i say ? he holds the symphony together with a tautness and logic that nobody ever credited this work with having before . how ? i have no idea , but when the start of part ii does n't jar , as it usually does , you know you 're in for something special . maybe it 's because the orchestral prelude there seems faster than usual , or because he finds so much inwardness in the first part ( the first entry of the soloists , for instance , is so raptly caressing ) . the orchestra : while they do n't have the `` mahler sound '' that the concertgebouw or vienna philharmonic may produce , there 's an earthiness ( but never sloppiness ) that sets them far apart from the bleached , sterile sound of too many american orchestras that make mahler sound not like mahler . to sum up , then , i could not speak for an hour after hearing this recording , and still burst into tears at the mere thought of it , especially those radiant , visionary , and extraordinary closing pages . record of the year ; record of the century ! it crowns not merely my mahler collection but an entire lifetime of listening to great music .
1	i heard this music on the excellent p b s documentary : `` liberty - the american revolution '' and i knew i had to have it ! it is the finest music i have heard , capturing the heart and soul of the american revolution . the documentary `` liberty '' was a masterpiece that was beautiful and moving . so too this music with its most wonderful arrangements and accompaniment . i love it ! i could hardly wait to get it in the mail . it framed the documentary ( which i also bought ) like a great frame compliments a beautiful canvas painting . superlatives fail me . this music must be experienced by first watching the great series on the american revolution and then by listening to it apart . this is some of the most wonderful music i have ever heard . it reminds me of the genius of aaron copland who wrote the applachian spring and rodeo suites
1	this is one of my favorites of 2004 . you got a seasoned vet of an mc rockin over some of the illest producers in underground hip hops beats ( madlib , j-zone , dangermouse ) and some pretty nice guest appearances . i have a couple of complaints on this album though , like the song `` love thang '' , the hook is wack and the beat is corny , another wack hook comes thru on the title track where you got prince po sounding like tonto from lone ranger chanting some indian ish , and on top of that in his rhyme he says some sh*t like `` and if the girl farts then she 's a pooter '' ? ? ? thats dumb . one last complaint then i 'm done hatin , but the chorus on bump bump is terrible , and i 'm embarrased to bump bump that ish when i 'm in my car because it sounds so wack , but raekwon 's verse takes me back to when wu tang was the untouchable squad they were back in the mid 90 's , which more than makes up for the lackluster chorus . aside from those complaints you got a dope album , j-zone hit this up with some of best beats i 've ever heard from him . so pick this up its definitely a good purchase
1	rock n ' roll history has many example of band/artists unlucky , that did n't get the recognition they deserve . here 's one . what is big star about ? a rock n ' roll , slightly psychodelic , most influenced by beatles and the byrds . the first record ( # 1 record - 1972 ) is the battle of two frontman putting one classic pop-rock tune after another . chilton gets the most rock stuff , chris the ballads , and also a contribution from hummel , the hippy `` india song '' . best moments : in the streets , thirteen , india song , when my baby 's beside me , my life is right . the second album - radio city - 1973 . chris left the band , claiming that chilton was getting too much control of everything . for this record , hummel contributes more , the band goes torward some stuff slightly different , like the soul intended o my soul ( maybe a reflection of the record label atmosphere . chilton here also takes full control of the musical direction , the albm sounds not better or worse , but less laboured , sounding in some tracks , more like a rehearsal , with a great garage feeling . stevens goes great on drums , specally on back of a car . best tracks : way out west , life is white ( although the harmonica annoys me a little ) , mod lang ( very bowie mood ) , back of a car , september gurls . at a glance , big star reminds me backing home from school , playing my guitar , calling my girlfriend on the phone and waiting for the weekend to go to the beach . a feeling of youthness that does n't come back , just like those special moments in a band 's career that later , they ca n't catch anymore , no matter how hard they try . for big star , no differ , they would never do anything like these two records . and sadly after bell 's death , chances are zero to none . why did n't they succeeded . well , ego stuff , lack of stax knowledge to deal with rock n ' roll bands , and the dicotomy that was ruling the rock n ' roll scene at the time : hard rock versus progressive rock . and what about big star ? neither hard rock , nor progressive . but , despite all that rubish , big star is pure rock n'roll , guitar band , 70 's style , recognizable in many current bands recording all over the world . big star is eternal .
0	if you are looking for boring , lifeless adult contemporary music , then this cd is for you . if you are looking for a great guitar cd , this is n't it . i had such high hopes for this cd after the robert johnson cds and the cream reunion , but all winning streaks must come to an end , and clapton 's comes to a screeching halt with this . of all the eric clapton cds that i like , this is n't one of them . i 'm glad clapton is now in a happy place ( and deservedly so ) , but this cd just does n't do it for me
0	i bought this album because i am so into sigur ros at the moment and it seems all the reviews i read say that `` ... if you like sigur ros you will like mbv.. '' let me say this album is no where near a sigur ros experience . if i could compare them to anyone it would be very early cocteau twins , though i must be clear i do n't think the singer is anywhere close to the artistic sense and vocal talent of elizabeth fraser . it would be more palatable if the production value was higher ... .it sounds terrible . the sound quality is comparable to some old vhs tapes i have from the mid 80 's that i recorded off the tv ( then soaked in water for a few days ! ) .
0	great recording , but if you want to actually use it , like load it on your ipod it has sony 's stupid drm . meaning you ca n't . do n't buy sony products ! !
1	hayley westenra , at only 18 years old , is an enchanting voice we should be hearing from for many years to come . this is an uplifting and at times , spiritual album that shows shades of greatness . throughout , westenra 's voice is captivating , though the musical scores are at times , sub-par and do not equal the vocal talent . there was an advertising tag on this cd that stated `` the female josh grobin '' , but i think a more accurate sentiment would be `` a young sarah brightman '' . odyssey is a fine mix of spiritual and operatic tunes , all of which match up well with westenra 's abilities . bocelli fans will also appreciate the duet , dell amore non si sa . they pair up for that one song , but the rest is all westenra . this is smooth , soothing and easy listening . if you like brightman , you will truly appreciate the voice of westenra .
0	man , have i given this guy a chance . multiple chances . listened to the cds , saw the big hbo special . i mean , his career is red hot now . he clearly has lots of fans . mostly college age ( perhaps this should be a warning to some of you ) . all i can say is `` maybe they 'll grow out of it . '' he is not funny . his act has no bite , no point of view , no opinion/viewpoint at all . his comedy consists of spewing observations his audience can relate to ( the `` this is all happened to us '' or `` has this ever happened to you ? '' school of humor ) . he runs about manically , acting out every little word that comes out of his mouth ( for those in the audience that may not be so good with words ) . his fans acknowledge that , yes , they can relate . `` yeah ! that 's happened to me ! '' `` i know that reference ! ' they laugh , cheer , clap , and plunk down their hard-earned dollars for his vanilla wit . he never actually comments on the things he discusses in any intelligent , interesting way . he has no edge . he 's not outraged by anything . he 's cute 'n ' cuddly . richard pryor must be rolling in his grave at the very fact that cook is classified as a stand up comic . `` pryor ? the guy writing this must be old ! ' okay , try this on for size : chris rock is good comedy . same with dave chappelle . carlin . laura kightlinger . kinison . rodney dangerfield . bob saget . gilbert gottfried . dom irrera . lewis black . robert klein . the late mitch hedberg . jim norton . patton oswalt . brian posehn . degeneres . jon stewart . bob david . the ucb . i 'm not even a big fan of sarah silverman , but at least she 's trying to bring something different to the party . anything but this ! god help us . let 's hope he goes the way of carrot top and dice soon ( do n't forget , cook fans , mr. top and mr. clay were once as popular as your boy here )
1	i love `` fool for the city '' i have also always loved savoy brown `` looking in '' and did n't know until recently that lonesome dave was the singer and most of the savoy brown band went on to form foghat . if you are a foghat fan you should check out `` looking in '' by savoy brown . if you 've heard other stuff by savoy brown and did n't like it , do n't be discouraged because `` looking in '' ( and only `` looking in '' ) is essentially foghat . there were a lot of changes in savoy brown personnel through the years and the guys that did looking in were the best .
1	i heard the chairman dances and went right to amazon to order this . this ia a lovely little gem of a cd , and it is so pleasing to find john adams , another great modern american composer . i 'm also a fan of composers such as christopher rouse , for example , and joe leniado chira is my cousin . modern composers are a precious resource that we should explore , demand more of and nurture . we afficianados would like to see symphony orchestras and ensembles giving more attention to the modern genre . meanwhile , john adams has impressed me with this disc . the chairman dances is my favorite . i can just see chairman mao doing a vigorous foxtrot to this , and tricky dick feeling jealous . this might be the music that opened china to the west
0	perhaps it 's a bit unfair because lucinda engenders such high expectations , but i was really disappointed with this record the songwriting is weak , the singing is weak , and the arrangements are dull something kicked all the life out of the music -- the songs are not all the same , but for some reason they all sound the same -- and embarrassingly , you can sing most of them after one listen , they are so simplistic and cliched
1	i love this cd ! i often put it in my personal cd player and take it to the coffee shop to help me as i study french . the music is relaxing but not sleep-inducing . steven halpern composes great music
0	while microsoft tries very hard to make office `` think ahead of me , '' they almost always seem to get it wrong . the result is a package that consistently annoys me . it is true that one can turn off the `` helpful '' hints and otherwise customize the programs so that they are less hindering , however the bloated package will nevertheless usurp your computers resources like nobody 's business . in my opinion , office '97 was an excellent package , and the versions since then have gone steadily downhill . as with many people , i use office at work because i have no choice . at home i 've had good luck with staroffice from sun . while not perfect , staroffice has read and created files compatible with microsoft office very consistently in my experience , and it 's a whole lot less expensive . i am therefore hesitant to recommend microsoft office professional edtition 2003 to anyone except those who need the most advanced functions of excel and/or need to use access database frequently .
1	this is one program that in my opinion you get more than what you pay for i have several immaging programs that i use for several different things . this one is a delight to use and does a great job taking most of the work off the user . its a microsoft program that is very user friendly and easy to use . however you do have to be some what computer savy , ( like know where to turn on the computer kind of thing ) not like some of the 1 star comments that were made here by other folks . i would recomend it to all people that need a simple to use program . its not what you pay for something its what you do with it after you get it

0	i 've been using spysweeper for 2 years now . it generally does what it is supposed to do . however , it was nearing time for me to renew . spysweeper becomes a huge , irritating nag when it comes time to renew . not only does the software bug you all the time , but webroot sends out reminder e-mails too . with 3 weeks left on my subscription , i decided to renew , mostly just to get rid of all the nagging . well , guess what ? - the renewal process reset my expiration date . rather than giving me 3 weeks plus 1 year , the renewal starts immediately , and ends in exactly 1 year - which means , that i 've been ripped off for 3 weeks of paid subscription . maybe webroot thinks their users are too stupid to notice this deceptive practice of moving up renewal dates . i 've complained to them - and if they do n't make amends , then i can not recommend this product to anyone
0	the video editing part of this software is completely useless . it did n't come with a manual and i ended up buying on my own a book about how to use it . it has n't made a difference . the software is completely uncooperative . my computer more than meets the minimum requirements for running the program . if you bought this software for the video editing , i recommend using the disc as a drinks coaster and buying something else
1	this is a great item for any collector or new fans to the x-men . all the older along with the newer issues look great . the cd includes all issues of the uncanny x-men ( 1-461 ) along with giant sized and annual issues . there is also comprehensive biographies on the more popular characters and artwork and layouts of the xaiver institute . could it of had more content , maybe , but this will keep one busy for a long time . with easy maneuverabiltity , this is a highly addictive cd with virtually months of entertainment
1	i was using other internet security programs in the past . all had their pros and cons . i decided to switch to pc-cillin 2006 home security pack and it is the best available ! . it has both virus and spyware protections built in . the scanning is quick and the updates are easy to get . plus this home security 3 pack is able to be installed on 3 computers , a bargain . all in all i am sold on this easy to use and comprehensive software product . i highly recommend this product to all ! amazon.com as usual had the best price
1	i wanted to see if i could do all the essential digital image editing `` on the cheap '' in pse5 ... and i am satisfied that i have been able to do just that . the best companion book i 've seen to assist in that effort is this one : adobe photoshop elements 5.0 maximum performance : unleash the hidden performance of elements by mark galer . the combination of the pse5 software and book proved to be perfect for me , and as near as i can tell , i can now do all the image editing i need to do , at a fraction of the cost and time required for the full-on photoshop product . i 'm very satisfied with my purchase . if you 're on the fence about it , i 'd recommend downloading the 30 day trial version from the adobe website prior to purchasing
0	warning ! i resized my partition and when it restarted my computed could not boot . it destroyed my system and i had to format my whole drive . read all the reviews from this program carefully . i read them but did not believe them
1	notice , you need at least 2gb ram not 1gb and vista it is for you !
1	i have used synmatec products for many years and have been fairly pleased by them . however , do n't buy the upgrade or renew your subscription until after your current subscription runs out because synmatec will not give you credit for the un-used portion of your previous subscription . i asked and they said `` no way '' . that aspect of `` customer service '' is very disappointing
0	i have always used norton antivirus , and had no problems with it at all . i have recently had to migrate to outlook 2003 and norton is 2005 and have non-stop system crashes . i have now uninstalled it and resinstalled my old version of norton professional and hey presto everything is working again - and not talking two hours to load .
0	do not use this product . it is very hard to remove from your computer . it is harder to install than norton , and is an inferior product . i will never buy their product again .
0	this software did n't quite do what i expected . i was somewhat disappointed when i discovered that it would n't convert itunes m4p music files to mp3 files to run on a real player .
0	i bought this product based on consumer reports review . i 've had norton and mcafee in the past which slowed down my system . my computer is slower to start up with zonealarm , but faster than mcafee while on . however , most of the time , i need to shut off zonealarm in order to access the internet - just like another reviewer . defeats the purpose do n't you think ? it also recognized my offices 's software as a virus and although i allowed access , it keeps showing it as a virus . i 'm going to have to go to another product .
1	this product is very superior over prior versions.it plays back your text in your own voice.my accuracy has improved in dragon naturallyspeaking 9 over other previous versions i have used . having been familiar with prior programs voice to text , it was easy to implement.it was a good investment . the product came promptly , and with no hassles
0	this is not the most recent version for this software . do an online search , check the manufacturer 's web site and you 'll find it cheaper for the latest version
0	if you read the license , you find that you probably give away rights to anything you use in a comic book . it also looks like you ca n't give away copies of comics you print , certainly ca n't sell them , and ca n't let others copy them . unless you want your child 's face on a cereal box without your permission , you probably do n't want this software
0	i bought this software to print my christmas cards and much to my dismay , it did not print properly on my hp inkjet printer . i tried various settings with the same bad results and finally had to contact tech support via email . here is the reply : `` thank you for contacting hallmark technical support . we apologize for any difficulties that you may have had with our software . this is a newly found issue with the program . the developers are currently working on an update that will correct this . they said that the update should be out around christmas . please routinely check for new updates by going to the help menu and selecting the check for updates option . when an update is available , you will be informed and it should automatically install the update . '' this is a `` printing '' software so when it does not print properly , it indicates that the software was not tested properly or simply the publisher expect the users to be beta-testers ! if some other features that did not work , it may be excused , but this bug is unexcusable ! i am sure the software developers will have the software bugs fixed , but at the meantime do n't be a beta-tester , buy someting else . humbug !
0	this product is horrifying . it worked for three months , at which point it experienced a complete meltdown . started getting auto-protect errors , and suddenly could access the internet with explorer , but not firefox . it kept trying to send me to live update , which would n't work , so i uninstalled and reinstalled norton . now the error happened again , and i could access the internet with firefox , but not explorer . an error message referred me to an online `` fix , '' but -- guess what ! -- you ca n't access any of their fixes with firefox . you must be using explorer . ( which is , in and of itself , offensive and obnoxious . ) explorer , of course , was n't working . ( incidentally , with norton uninstalled , all worked fine , so that was indeed the source of the problem . ) uninstalled and reinstalled norton again , hoping to get on explorer and get the fix before the error recurred , but now i could n't get on the internet at all . at that point , i uninstalled norton for good . ditto on the fact that they do n't support the product , apparently do n't stand behind the product , and apparently are n't very concerned about their reputation . very disappointing . previous versions were just fine ; this is a complete mess
0	i was thoroughly disappointed . the first few words i looked up in the thesaurus were not listed -- words like upholstery ! when i went online to see what i might be able to glean from their online site , first fogware had not sent me a coupon , then i had to deal with bad customer service ( i am not doing business with any companies anymore that give bad support ) then after i finally got the coupon code they had left out of my box , the online info is exactly what we have in the cd -- so save your money and do not subscribe to their extended services site unless you need a spanish online dictionary also ! very bad ! i am now going to go buy roget 's and check it out
0	unit gives inconsistant results especially with front projection sets . spyder also requires room to be as dark as possible in order to make adjustments . this is not always practical . the tripod mount fits too loose on spyder and easily falls off . i think this is a good beginning to a potentially fine product , but not yet ready for prime time
1	this upgrade installed easily with my photoshop 5.5 . no problems at all . this is an excellent program and leap years ahead of my photoshop 5.5 . this is a much less expensive way to upgrade to cs2..rather than purchasing cs2 outright . be sure to get the updates after you install the program .
0	i have moderate knowledge of computers , etc . and i found this overly complicated . this is not intended for the novice . however , even if you are not a novice it seems to still be a waste of money . i wish i had not bought it at all . perhaps it has secrets and treasures i am not aware of ... but the directions are complicated and it would be by chance that you would ever discover them . save your money ... this was a waste
1	the computer game version of the number devil closely follows the book , as kids progress through sections on prime numbers , the fibonacci series , pascal 's triangle , and an infinite series approaching one . nine of the ten games worked well for us , but nobody in the family was ever able to complete the tenth , the arrow game . we understood the math , but could n't react quickly enough to shoot down all the arrows . this was disappointing , because we could never reach the bonus section . all in all , though , this is a good investment for a child , 8 or up , who loves or wants to understand the mystery of numbers
1	office 2007 was a very nice improvement over previous versions . the program was stable , for me at least , and the new interface was very nice . it may take a few minutes to find where some commands have been moved to but the result was a much cleaner interface . one thing that keeps in mind is that it uses a different file format from previous versions by default . there is the option of changing the format to the previous version but the default option is n't compatible with earlier programs
0	it 's definitely an awful piece of software . it 's totally unstable under winxp sp2 and ie7 . follow other peoples advice and get quicken '06
1	i had the software in just a couple days and it was exactly as i ordered . along with it came an information sheet on what to do and who to contact if there were any problems . great job . would order from them again
0	be careful with this program . my wife bought it , and i tried to install it for her on our pc . i made several attempts , and each time installation hung at a different stage of the installation procedure . when installation hung , i could not cancel or kill it , or even shut down the pc without pressing the reset button ( on windows xp pro ) . i went to the support page of the web site , and found a faq item about incompatibility with zone alarm . if you 're not familiar with zone alarm , it is a personal firewall and security product that is very common among home users . according to nova development , the only way to get scrapbook factory deluxe 3.0 to install is to permanently remove zone alarm . besides being a serious security risk , this is an extreme measure to have to take . this seems to be perfectly ok with nova development . they offer no workaround other than removing zone alarm from the pc . personally , this would be enough to give me pause about installing the product even if i did not use zone alarm . you have to wonder what the installer is trying to do that even the presence of dormant security software interferes with it .
1	as one who is not an accountant , i found quickbooks premier non-profit edition 2006 to be very easy to learn . read the books that come with the software before you dive in
0	i bought the software ( digital image suite 2006 ) before i bought my camera - to be ready to process the pictures i was going to take . a big mistake . i bought a canon 30d camera and record my images in raw format ( *.cr2 ) . unfortunately , not all canon .cr2 raw files are the same . so , even though the software says you can edit .cr2 raw images , it depends on which camera made the image . here is complaint number two - if you use microsoft 's customer service/technical support you will be routed to india - and they will just give you an answer that is vaguely related to your problem . after emailing several times and getting nowhere you will find out that you ca n't write to their washington state headquarters unless you have the name of someone in the address . so , basically , microsoft is the largest technical software company in the world with the worst customer service and no american technical support . now , for the final complaint . there is no link or method to get updates or upgrades for this program ! so , if i want to use a microsoft software package to edit my photo images then i will have to buy a new software package - is n't that wonderful .
0	feeling more than a bit fleeced by mcafee 's overpriced `` subscription '' renewal every year , i decided to give kaspersky a try . installation went smoothly and everything seemed fine for 2 or 3 weeks . then one day my computer would not boot -- -just stalled on a blank screen right after the windows xp splash screen . when trying to boot up in safe mode , a list of the drivers currently loading scrolled down the screen . it stopped at a file called kl1.sys and hung there forever . a little research at work showed that this was a kaspersky file . it may be just a coincidence that my system suddenly went kaput shortly after installing the new antivirus program , but i doubt it . attempts to use a recovery disk failed . a trip to the local computer shop revealed that the data on my hard drives ( which were in the inscrutable raid 0 format ) could not be recovered ( unless i wanted to ship them to a recovery shop , and nothing on them was worth that much ) . so they 're going to reinstall windows , i 'll have to do reinstall a shipload of software when i finally get my computer back , and , yes , i 'll lose all the data that was on there . ( gee , good thing i backed up all the kids ' photos -- -well , most of them . thanks , kaspersky ! ) anyway , perhaps my attempts at recovering the os caused the worst of this . whatever the case , i believe the boot failure was caused by either the kaspersky file being corrupted or a virus . who knows . kaspersky is to blame in both scenarios . i do know one thing : i am not going to tempt fate by loading this program on my computer again . and kaspersky has yet to respond to my e-mail . i got an automated `` we received your e-mail '' response , but nothing more , even though they state that they usually respond within a day or two . that was over a week ago . if in fact their software is in no way responsible for my computer flaking out on me , then i still do not apologize for the one-star rating , given their horrible customer service . if you decide i 'm insane or that this was just a fluke , at least do yourself a favor and make a decent boot disk for yourself before installing this product . that might mean the difference between losing data/spending $ $ $ and just being inconvenienced . and do n't expect much assistance from kaspersky should things go wrong .
1	this is a good inexpensive gps system . it does a good job of tracking your location . the map is excellent . the labeling is not as good as the previous version . poi finder is top notch
0	generally like the program . hoped it came with a cd to practice in the car but was wrong . it is totally pc based . i 'll let you know in about three months if i can actually conduct business in deutsch .
1	this is a really great bargain . the spreadsheets are easy to use with built-in formulas just like excel , instead of paying hundreds of dollars . this was better than i expected for the money . excellent product , would highly recommend it for any home business , small business or everyday budgets , events and home bookkeeping . this is a 5 star program
1	this software offers simple and easy to use way of getting ones affairs in order
0	i have been using frontpage since 1997 . i am webmaster for three websites and have alway really thought this was a great program ! but ! i have only upgraded to frontpage 2000 and find that with my xp computer , win xp does not support frontpage . now , if i want to continue with my family genealogy site and a community genealogical society site , i will need to purchase and learn another program . at age 70 , i really do n't feel like doing that ! does anyone know if fp 2003 will work on win xp ? or how can i get my fp 2000 to work on my win xp computer ?
1	i got a hold of a windows vista ultimate disk . it gave the choice to install home basic , home premium , business , or ultimate . i installed vista home basic , because i only have 512 mb of ram . likes : i like the new wallpapers and the way it looks . my documents and my music folder remind me of itunes . dislikes : do n't like that my less than 6 month old hp printer does n't work with vista and my usb net link cable does n't work with vista . when you install something screen slowly fades out and then a window comes up asking you if you want to run the program and trust it . it 's a little annoying because it forces you to stop what your doing and answer the question before you can continue . verdict : i like it , but the incompatibility issues are enough for me to want to stick with xp . i would n't buy home basic . if you really want vista , buy a new computer with vista preinstalled or install a trial version of vista to make sure everything works . i 'm going back to xp , until hp releases vista drivers for my printer . i 'll write reviews on home premium , business , and/or ultimate if i ever get more ram . my computer 2.8 ghz pentium d 512 mb ram 128 mb video car
1	i decided to get this office suite after using it recently . i 've usually worked on office 97 and 2000 , but the 2003 version has some pretty cool features not found in the older versions . the feature that i really enjoy is the pivot report feature in ms access , which was n't in ms access 2000 . this is a truly great reporting feature . you can now use access as a front-end to slice and dice data stored on data warehouses in oracle , sql server , sybase and other enterprise-type databases . if you 're used to creating crosstab reports , you 'll definitely like the pivot report feature . crosstabs are limited to 2 dimensions but there 's no limitation on the number of dimensions in pivot report . to me , the main drawback is the price . ( i did get mine at around $ 370 at j , which is a great price . ) i figure i can upgrade this in about 5 years time , which works out to about $ 70 to $ 75 per year ( assuming that i 'll be paying about $ 370 to upgrade in 5 years time . ) a big positive is that this is the industry standard . so the work you put into learning the multiple new features of word , excel , ms access is not wasted because you can reuse the same skills in another job . your time will be well spent . note that the software may seem bloated but the intelligent user is able to choose and pick the most useful and relevant features of each application and ignore the features that are not useful . different features are useful to different people ... another positive : each product in office professional is fully programmable using visual basic for applications ( vba ) which you can use to build custom programs . this very powerful feature is sometimes overlooked when shopping for office suites .
1	this is the best version of office yet . the differences are numerous and very significant , it is well worth the investment !
1	drills are excellent , vocabulary has good variety ... picking up the grammar from the application without explanation is tough for me , but i guess that 's the way kids learn any language .
0	i am extremelly disappointed with roxio , the makers of cd creators ; especailly easy cd creator 5 . i purchased easy cd creator 5 , sometime back from an affiliate of amazon.com . it was dispatched promptly and in very good condition . i installed it on my computer running windows 98 . after some initial problmes it was running fine . a few days back i installed windows xp professional on my computer , and i got a message that the cd creator was not compatible with this version of windows . it hinted to contact roxio . i tried contact roxio with the help of the link , but found it impossible to send them my message . they have an automated `` roxann '' that is so difficult to understand . next they invite you to a `` webticket '' and you are supposed to mention your problem on it . but when you submit your query or complain , nothing happens . the site just stares at you dumbly ! ! there is no way to obtain roxio 's mailing address either . so now i am stuck with this `` easy cd creator 5 '' with no help from roxio ?
1	i read horror storied about 7.0 nero so i upgraded to 6.6 from 5.5 by going to the amazon new used market . this is a good program that does all you need for dvd 's and cd 's . it gets good reviews . i ca n't imagine what happened to 7.0 but they may have gotten carried away with `` user friendly-ness '' - i see a little of that in 6.6 compared to 5.5
0	picassa , part of the google suite of programs , is both better than this program and free ! what more do i need to add ? the user interface of picassa is easier to use and more responsive
1	i do n't know what other people are complaining about . i just installed vista ultimate a few days ago and i absolutely love it . no interface lag or any other lag at all . maybe the people complaining have weak or outdated hardware . those people need to turn down their settings if their not going to keep their computers on the cutting edge or at least near it . i 'm glad microsoft is n't waiting for people to catch up and are on the cutting edge . i 'd rather be the one catching up than the other way around . i have a core 2 duo e6300 overclocked to 2.5ghz , 2 gigs of ram , a geforce 7600gt and a western digital raptor 150g hd and vista ultimate works flawlessly on my computer . it 's not the best computer but it runs flawlessly , i built it myself and all the parts cost me about $ 850 off the net . i play world of warcraft among some other games and i have n't seen any problems yet with any games or any of the major software i use as of yet . i 've only encountered one problem and that was with my old soundblaster live ! 5.1 sound card which has discontinued support . no big deal , it was about time to get a better one anyway . vista is awesome , i love everything about it . it 's very futuristic and it is not a simple interface makeover at all like some clueless dummies proclaim . by the way , i only paid $ 110 for vista ultimate upgrade off ebay , check there first if you already have an existing os and want to save some dough
0	after purchasing this product , i found there were several problems with scanning . i contacted nuance ( who purchased scansoft ) to ask for assistance from technical support . however , i then learned they want $ 9.95 for each incident when a request is made by email . not by phone - by email . after putting out a great deal of money for this product , i should not have to pay $ 9.95 for assistance with each issue that is a problem with their product . save yourself a great deal of grief and avoid this product . i regret that amazon does not allow me to give this product `` 0 '' stars .
0	bought this 3-pack about 2 months ago ( three computers at home ) and worked ok- no viruses . then i did what i thought was a clean install of xp pro from xp home on one of the computers , and it carried over a lot of garbage from xp home i wanted to get rid of , but that 's another issue ( clean install ? } . after installing xp pro , i was warned i did n't have virus protection and so i tried installing my nav again . you would think at some point nav would have enough brains to try and establish that this was a windows upgrade , and that the nav was legitimate . nope- fatal error and computer lock-up , which i was able to survive . no contact opportunity at the symantec web site . i simply opted for microsoft 's recommended anti-virus software- computer associates . another twenty . then i had a heck of a time uninstalling nav , which would n't install and now would n't uninstall . what a waste of time and money . who creates these viruses ? we certainly know who benefits from them . there is really nothing you can do- they are immune unless they hurt someone with media clout . this little note means diddily , but thanks to amazon anyhow for the opportunity to say something .
0	i was able to install most of ms office but am having printer conpatability problems . i was n't able to install vitural pc properly and get error messages when i boot up . i 'm going to have to the mac store genius bar to get the problems straightened out . all in all i think that every thing will work ok but i 'm going to have yto travel over 50 miles to get it fixed . maybe it 's best to stick with mac software for macs . i 've never has a problem installing them
0	this program does not allow you to switch to elevation and view or alter framing details . i 'm only using it for a simple garage and i expected to be able to generate simple working plans with basic demensions . not so . you might as well pick up a copy of the sims so you could at least have some fun with it . if you want to get rough ideas this might be for you but if you actually want to work from it , forget it . very disappointing waste of money
0	this software is fine for altering digital pictures if you do not have any other programs , but if you want to make exciting slideshows , this software is very basic and not user-friendly . i had technical problems from the start . you are better off using ms powerpoint than this software
1	product has a nice clean interface . i was able to load most drivers and application software without incident . note - upgrade install requirements are not clear . microsoft should state what is expected on your system prior to trying to install either as an upgrade or clean install . microsoft sites keep pointing back to sites that do n't help very much .
0	i got this game because i thought it would be fun . i was totally wrong ! every customer that i got brought only rabbits . rabbits , rabbits , rabbits ! ! ! this game confused me a lot . also , it gets very boring . and , it 's very hard to control . do n't waste your money on this game ! it will be a total waste of your money . believe me
1	i 've been using printmaster for years to create greeting cards , party invitations , banners and posters for my kids ' school . this version has a lot of great new art and images and my son has even made personalized cover for his ipod . i 'd reccomend it to anyone who likes printmaster or wants to create great-looking projects at home
0	i 've been using apple 's macintosh systems since 1984 and have seen some great improvements in system stability , which i consider the most important aspect of an os . first off tiger is a smooth running system ( when it is smoothly running ) , and has some of the nicest bells and whistles around . the best dog-and-pony show around . that being said , watch out ! this os is capable of completely hosing your user settings , all your software registrations , bookmarks , email settings , etc . the whole enchilada . any os that can do that at the drop of a dime is n't worth the time . since i use disk warrior , cocktail and disk utility regularly , this should never have happened . i waited until the os was at the 10.4.3 stage before upgrading from 10.3.9 -- apparently it is not yet ready -- best to wait another year before upgrading . hopefully these bugs will be fixed
0	talk about junk ! no search capability , mislabeled cds , some cds wo n't run - in short , yuk !
0	after years of e-filing fees being included with the purchase price , it would have been more forthcoming for turbotax to put a large sticker on the front of their box alerting buyers to the price that they will pay for e-filing each return . i lost the value of my entire state return - and then some - through e-filing fees : $ 44.95 ( plus tax ) for the program , $ 16.95 ( plus tax ) for each return e-filed ( i filed two ) and a little bonus fee to the company that handles the [ credit card ] transaction ( that fee is never quoted in the program and i will have to wait for my credit card statement to find out what that is ) . in addition , anyone who chooses to have the fees deducted from his/her refund has to pay an additional $ 30 . the product does what it says . but , for the cost , and less-than-honest way in which the change occured ( it almost seemed deceitful - hence the single star rating ) , i would have preferred to have given my money to my friendly neighborhood accountant . people expect change , even if they do n't like it . but , suprises that cost customers money are never welcome and drive customers away . surely the marketing/advertising gurus can think of a way to alert the customer of a significant change such as this and even put a `` positive '' spin on it . `` filing fees only $ 16.95 [ per return ] - less than the cost of a tax professional . . . '' no more turbotax for me
0	... for indesign to not have one basic features . everyone i know still does french folds , but in order to see double page spreads in indesign you have to lay them out wrong in the program , then you have to painstakingly go through your document and shift the entire document by one page , layout by layout . this is mortally stupid . at this point adobe should have figured how a tool like i.d . is actually used in conjunction with a printer , not just assumed the user wants to print what they see on their screen . the oversight is the difference between avergage klunky desktop publishing software and a great layout tool . why is n't there a button that toggles me between the layout view and priont output ? why do i have to slave over a document like this ? adobe , stop thinking in the abstract and investigate how your software can facilitate printed results . also who knows how you get an alpha path or clipping path into this ? mine shows me a heavily pixelated , entirely xparent bw image when it supposed to be a cropped color image . what do you want me to do with that
0	i wanted to use this product to tape sporting events , as part of a promotions unit i belong to . i had used videowave 7 which was ok and produced a more than adequate product , but would on occassion crash to the extent i would have to reload the software . i thought i would give pe 3.0 ago , since adobe products generally have a good reputation . well , it goes to show that you ca n't just rely on reputation . the program lets me down horribly when capturing the video from the camera . the camera records dvd video ( vob files ) straight to dvd . when i capture these files into the pe program , all moving images within the video become pixelated with lost resolution to the point of being useless . i have tried various other ways of capturing but always the same result . there is nothing to be done from that point ... for me this program falls on the first hurdle ! ! it is unbelievable to me that a professionally released image processing algorithm could corrupt video so badly , and frustrating that i actually paid money for it ... a first year undergraduate could have provided a better effort . i have subsequently gone through the motions to produce a video , and to be honest he layout of the settings , ease of applicaiton of various functions is quite good and better than videowave 7 imho . i was able to produce quite nice edited products with intro , text and audio overlays very quickly . still this is n't much use when the video itself had already been digitally butchered . if you are videoing things that do n't move you may well like this product . if you are videoing dynamic scenes , give it a miss . big disappointment
0	i thought this would be a good product for my computer . i did n't know that the only way to receive this product is over the internet via download . during the process the prompts for the internet download ask you to remove ( uninstall/delete ) all of your known antivirus , spyware , and firewalls from your computer prior to install . this leaves your computer susceptible when you receive an error message . i received an error message that prevented me from completing the download . i purchased the software on aug 3 and called customer support , they researched the problem and even took remote access of my computer to try and fix the issue . they were unable to do so and then passed me to the second level of computer technicans . microsoft guards its secrets well and has varying levels of technical support , those that know the basics and those that know more . they asked me to set up a time span when i would like to receive a call from the `` teir ii '' agents , i chose 6-9pm . i received several calls over the next two weeks , all of them were outside of the specified time . i missed several of them because i have a career and a life . when i finally spoke with an agent they again took over remote access of my computer and were also unable to solve the issue . here it was , two weeks after i purchased the software , i still did not have what i needed . i was also unable to surf the web because the download process requires you to delete all antivirus and firewall software . i called in several times druing the ordeal and the `` teir i '' agents just told me that i have to wait for the call , `` they 'll get to it when they get to it . '' i was very upset with the customer support , i have no idea how the product is , but the customer support is just horrible . go to the windows live onecare home page and search for the `` post your own thoughts '' page through member accounts , you 'll see that i 'm not alone in this issue . i have since purchased other software that cover what microsoft says it will with onecare . i did not have one problem with these installs . please be aware that you might have to purchase technical support if you can not download due to a problem with your operating system ( seperate from onecare ) . this costs an additional $ 35 ontop of the cost for onecare
0	as a teacher i use word , powerpoint , and publisher when working with students and engaging in professional activities ( presentations to organizations , etc . ) i have been using office 2002 , and thought i should upgrade . big mistake . the ribbons of icons are frustrating to scroll through , especially since i previously just customized the toolbar so everything i needed was immediately available . i 'm still trying to figure out how to type in chinese , although the spanish and german are working fine . additionally , they 've come up with a truly ugly color scheme for their ribbons/icons/etc . as a previous commenter noted , making changes to the basic template creates extreme problems , and i also was unable to get the darn number bullets to renumber . it took me almost twice as long to write a test as usual , and i ended up doing manually what used to be done quite easily using the toolbar . the designs in publisher are now very difficult to see and differentiate . in previous versions , you could see the stark differences between different designs . in the current options pages , everything is so soft , both in line and color , as well as being so small , that it 's hard to tell what you 're looking at . but the truly big disappointment is powerpoint . their new selection of slide designs has all the appeal of rotting road kill -- i would be embarrassed to give a presentation to a professional group using what is available in 2007 . i have reinstalled my 2002 programs . i feel like i just wasted all the money i spent on this suite . my suggestion ? if you absolutely have to have a pc because you do a lot of word processing , stick with word 2002 or 2003 . if you need to do presentations/brochures/etc . for your business , get a mac and avoid this problem altogether
0	i recently tried to update my norton systemworks . halfway through the update , i got a message telling me it was unable to uninstall my old norton systemworks . i tried to back out of the installation at that point , but was unable . i called the norton company , spent an hour on the phone with a tech , only to have them tell me it was my computer . i assured them that i was just using my computer , which was fine , and now it does n't work . they told me there was nothing further that they could do , and that i would have to call a computer service company . i found out that the uninstall process corrupted my operating system , causing me to lose everything on my hard drive , and requiring a new operating system . i have run into other people who had exactly the same problem , with no help from the norton company . i will never again buy a norton product . i only wish i could get my money back from them .
1	i think this is actually a very good os . there are a lot of new features and home premium appears to be the best vista os for the money . i purhased a new pc with this os and have really found no compelling reason to upgrade to ultimate for $ 150 . only legitimate gripe concerns drivers for non-microsoft products . not excatly sure why this is microsoft 's problem though . regardless , this os is the smart choice for a new pc for home use . accept a minimum required graphics and audio card until suppliers catch up with this new os . then upgrade . otherwise , wait till you need a new pc
0	what a complete pain ! ... .. we now use macs . however , i decided to take the california bar examination july 2006 . the california bar examiners allow the use of laptops utilizing a software program written by examsoft . presently , the software will only work on windows xp . moreover , the california bar examiners will not allow any macs , even the newer macs with the intel processors which require complete re-booting into windows . as a result , i was forced to upgrade my gateway laptop , a fine laptop as far as pcs are concerned , in order to sit for this bar examination . ( that , or purchase a new laptop , which was probably the point . ) thank god for gateway computer technical support as the microsoft folks are clueless : even though the warranty on my gateway laptop expired some time ago , gateway has walked me through more issues during the installation process than i can possibly discuss here . conversely , microsoft simply bounces me around from one tech support person to the next until the telephone becomes disconnected . ... .. i suspect that the marketing strategy is that new software ( any new software ) will only work with the newer versions of windows xp or vista , and since vista will be such a memory hog , consumers eventually will be forced to dump their pcs which can not be upgraded , for new pcs . as for how the operating system actually works : a grade of fair . yesterday , the microsoft update website was down which , according to microsoft 's discussion website seemed to be a problem with other window users as well . typical
1	i use microsoft streets and trips 2007 in a laptop computer for navigational assistance anytime i 'm traveling to a destination where i 'm not absolutely certain how to get there . in general , i 'm pleased with it 's performance . it has saved me from wrong turns many times . however , the data seems to be as much as five years out of date on many street additions . gps tracking on country roads is inaccurate enough to cause constant `` off route '' - `` back on route '' messages as you navigate twists and turns . i suspect , in that case , the map data is just not that accurate
0	this dude is selling info that you can learn from anyone with very limited computer knowledge . all of the same info is on the net for free . this product exists for one purpose ... to steal from you . this pathetic thief has gone through the trouble of putting together an eleaborate scam to steal from his customers by charging their credit card 80 bucks a month without their permission . he could have used his energy and tallents to just make a good product ... but scams seem to be his thing . avoid ! ! this is the worst company that i have ever delt with in my entire life . this john guy and anyone that works for him should be ashamed . he is an embarrasement to his company and his family . at least a mugger steals from me face to face ... this snake is sneaky about it
1	i checked around before making this purchase , and amazon had the best price for print shop . i love it , i 've used it for a couple of projects and i have no complaints . it 's like a one stop shopping for all your publishing needs
1	it 's a great product . especially for someone like me who works long hours and no chance of getting to take a language class formally , this is the way to go ! thank you
0	it only became clear to me how ms undermines mac by using its software as weapon when i began using ms office for mac . i have used window 's based excel everyday at work for the last 20 years and i can not figure out how to use the mac version efficiently . it seems like an ersatz version from 15 years ago . if you want to work on powerpoint docs at home created on your pc at work you will find the effort not worth it ... the docs will never transfer formatting properly . i bought this program and almost never use it because it is just so clumsy compared to the pc version . having said that , there is no alternative to ms office ; this is the outcome of ms having monopoly power ... no support and an inferior product for mac user
0	i am a software tech . i first `` free trial '' v6 online- 1 . finds 131 errors , but will only fix 4 ( must buy full version ! ) . sheesh ! 2 . buy full version with 20 % off coupon ( 3 computer lic , for only $ 9.95 more- their web site ) . 3 . does not remove left/overs ... , from old uninstalled pgms . ( fix-it utilities `` 6 '' safely did- read my review ) . 4 . then they only support updates ... for 1 year- auto-renew ! rip-off ! i got a refund , and will never use them again
1	so i did the unthinkable . i put windows vista business on my mac -- specifically my mac mini . it works great , no system slow downs and no crashes . the mac handles vista beautifully . i had no problems using boot camp 1.2 in order to install it . the mac drivers for vista ( included with boot camp ) all worked fine . the vista installation took all of about 30 minutes including some updates and such . i had windows xp home on my mac b4 and while it worked well , vista business works much more smoothly . as you may or may not know a mac mini is not exactly a powerhouse computer . i have a 1.66 gigahertz core duo with 1gb of ram on it . it displays the aero interface perfectly especially hooked up to my 32 inch widescreen lcd tv . seems even the lowest cost mac can still make vista shine while most pcs cant . one disclaimer tho . all intel macs can run vista ultimate without a hitch except the mac mini ( which can only go up to business/home premium ) while vista is still behind os x 10.4 ( tiger ) its a much better release from xp . now im just waiting to upgrade my little mac mini in october for the release of os x 10.5 ( leopard )
0	i 've been a user of pinnacle version 8 ( which i loved ) , and needed to update to a version that could burn dual layer dvds . what a disappointment this `` upgrade '' has been . crash after crash . what is most disappointing is that pinnacle built in a feed back system so the users could `` help '' them develop a better product . this means to me that they knowingly released bad code , and used their customers as guinny pigs while sticking us for a $ 100 . guess what , i do n't want to help pinnacle build a better product . i want a product that works when i purchase it . lesson learned . next time i read a bad review on a product , i 'm staying away
1	for anybody who needs the full power of acrobat , this is the way to go . highly recommende
1	this new version of illustrator is great , glad i upgraded ! the live trace feature is cool
1	this was a wonderful game ! hours of good , solid game play . an interesting mystery and intriguing characters . a chance to interact with aquatic life . i learned how to work a gps and a ham radio . it was so much fun . the puzzles were a good mix of ability-levels and types . word puzzles , spatial puzzles , problem-solving ones . i can completely recommend this game
1	i have been using pc-cillin after dumping mcafee following some lousy customer support with no issues . this new version i was very concerned after reading all of the reviews . it does seem to slow things a little on my amd pc if i am running all of the options i can run but even with them it is tolerable . i am sure you would not want to run this on anything less but it does work and managing it has been simple .
1	microsoft office ultimate 2007 is fairly good once you know how to use it . it is a a little difficult if you are new to how the menus work but once you know how they work it is fairly simple to use
0	so far we have been unable to use this product in the way we want to use it . we contacted tech support , but after one call , we will be charged $ 19.95 for each call . i have been disappointed in the product and the company
1	i have been running xp for a few days and so far so good . i was running win98se and decided to upgrade after microsoft announced that they no longer support win98 . my software is now obsolete ? yikes ! well , i 'm glad i upgraded . installation went smooth as silk and i have not experienced any problems at all . i had to find a couple of new drivers for hardware but that 's been it . and for home edition versus pro , i think i can be quite happy with the home edition . i will say that win98se had been a headache for a long time so the stability that i see so far with xp home is a relief . good features , good reliability . a very decent upgrade . i recommend it . four stars
1	have been using acrobat since v3 , v4 , v6 . v8 is in line . seems a bit faster , smoother etc . have tried imitations on other machines . from a purely subjective view , acrobat is best . a bit pricey , but the best . with the usual caveats , can be installed on a desktop and a notebook , but requires a call to tech support which was quick and smooth
1	i 've used version 2003 and enjoyed it thoroughly . i primarily used it for school with different classes and notes for each . what was great is that is consolidates everything in a way that makes it easy to retrieve your notes . it also makes it easy to generate reports based on the tagging feature . the tags allow you to highlight and gather key points of information that make writing papers a breeze . when working with paper , this was not always an easy task to take on . several weeks ago , i downloaded the trial version of onenote 2007 . the improvements are rather subtle , but powerful . it did n't take anything to get comfortable with the new features . after a short time with the trial version i just purchased it because it was so much fun . here are some of the beneficial features : -like a paper notebook you have sections , but with onenote 2007 you can have as many sections as you like . -you can easily link pages to outlook . i have linked appointments to a series of notes and support files for various projects and meetings . it makes being organized for a meeting a breeze . -also , it 's a great way to archive emails in a way that allows you to see them and organize them as you wish . you can empty your in box and at the same time keep a record of important emails . well worth your time . -it is also tablet friendly if you use a tablet pc like i do . i love it for that use . there is a fantastic text recognition feature that works extremely well . if you use a tablet , this is a great feature . -as was with the earlier version , you can add voice content to your notes . that 's right , voice recorded messages can be added to your notes . too cool . before you buy , you might want to go to the microsoft site and download the trial version . you 'll be able to assess for yourself . i think you 'll be pleased . i fond it to be one of the best products for 'electronic file keeping ' that i 've used . for the price , it 's not a bad deal .
0	pinnacle studio can assist the amateur videographer in ... hold on ... let me start again . pinnacle studio can assist the amateur videographer in editing some fairly interesting ... dang it ! give me a few minutes here ... pinnacle studio can assist ... ( samuel l jackson-styled expletive ) ... how many times is this gon na happen ? start and stop ! start and stop ! enough already ! one more time . now , what was i saying ? oh , yeah ... pinnacle studio can assist the amateur videographer in editing some fairly interesting video ... if you can keep it up and running . got the idea ? just adding my voice to the chorus of those have experienced the frustration of the pinnacle products . this is a bargain-priced product for which you will pay the cost of long hours of irritation and heart-pounding races to meet project deadlines -despite the software malfunctions . after installing the program , installing the patches , uninstalling the program and patches and reinstalling the program and the patches , i am still experiencing too many crashes . if you intend to use this program to piece together a video of uncle morty 's birthday party , the family vacation or your neighbor 's kid 's bar mitzvah , the cost and the ease of this program may outweigh the annoyance of its aforementioned weakness . if , however , your video projects fit under the category of `` job description , '' then i suggest spending the money for adobe premiere
0	i had to upgrade to ms works 7.0 due to y2k issues . i am not nearly as satisfied with ms wortks 7.0 as i was with ms works 4.5 . i am now searching for a replacement
0	the only redeeming quality about this gps system is that it 's cheap . i used it on a 1,000 mile trip on the east coast the week after i got it . the navigation is poor . i found that i often had to look over to the laptop screen because i was `` off route '' so often due to the poor maps . the system repeated the same annoying problems that i see in other feedback . 1 ) the unit would show me being off the road even though i was on an interstate . in this case it would continually recalculate the route and diretc me to take exits to get off the highway and circle around . 2 ) it directed me to make turns onto one-way streets in the wrong direction . 3 ) it could not locate a poi that turned out to be a few hundred yards away 4 ) it often did not know the correct side of the road for my destination 5 ) it does n't provide a chime when it 's time for a turn . it will tell you the turn is a half-mile ahead , but that might be the last time you hear an instruction . 6 ) in one case , it got me to my destination ( at least close enough ) but could n't guide me back to my starting point . the gps receiver seemed to acquire and hold the satellite signal well . but the maps are poor , as is the verbal instruction - it sounds like a 1980 's computer generated voice . if you 're looking for a trustworthy guide in unfamiliar areas - this is n't it . this is going back asap .
0	this software suite promises to do everything on earth , but does n't tell us how . there is no useful help file . there are no tutorials or instructions on the website . and , nero 's support is a joke ( just try to get a message through ) . i do n't understand how a company that started out with the best burn program in the game has sunk to this
1	ms put office 2007 on a dvd rather than a cd so there is only one disk , so they make the installation easier right off the bat . unlike all previous versions of office , you do not have to get into the details of what options you want . in previous versions , if you did n't make sure you installed all the features , when you went to do a function that was n't installed , you had to dig out your office disks and install the feature . a huge pain , but not anymore . the installation is hands down the easiest of all versions of office . you do n't have to tell it manually where to find your files . you do n't have to manually put in your favorite buttons . it 's all done for you . yes it takes some getting use to the new layout of the functions , but once you figure them out , it is so nice and smooth . this version is light years better than all previous versions . the most impressive part of the installation is outlook 2007 . in all previous versions , you had to export and import all your files and contacts . anyone who experienced this , knows that it never went that smooth . sometimes it was awful and you lost emails and contacts in the transfer , and the time it took to do this , was very painful . this is not the case with outlook 2007 . just load the program and it does all the transfers from your previous version of outlook . you do n't have to do a thing , and you 're up and running without missing a beat when the program is done loading . you will be shocked how simple it is . anything new has it 's growing pains to learn , but once you do , you will be very glad you made the change
0	complete waste of money . i purchased my copy at wal-mart but wanted to warn others before they made the same mistake i did . the graphics and templates they use on the package to lure you in are nice and tasteful . the actaul program is so not like that . the graphics are down right cheesy , and low budget . having only paid $ 9 for this program , i feel like i was completely ripped off . i 'll for sure be calling the company and asking for a refund . 1 star seems like too many to give this awful item
1	i love this product . i had a sample version of it prior to that expired , and i needed to have the full edition . it came in a timely fashion as well . i am very pleased
0	i hate this product . since i 'm used to office 2003 ( at work ) , opening this program and having to look at the childish-looking menu bar was a shock . the layout is irritating , poorly designed , and does not provide sufficient features . to make things worse , this sorry program does not allow you to save files directly to cd . the one-star rating was too generous .
0	unfortunately , i had to return the product because it was defective . the first disk failed to load to my computer . i contacted punch technical staff and they were unable to help me with the problem . i tried on another computer in the house , and the same thing happened . i therefore returned the product
1	i trust the information i find from britannica and so invested in the 2007 britannica ultimate reference suite . it has something for everyone . i use it side by side with microsoft encarta and together i get a more complete subject review . i prefer the content of britannica but for ease of use encarta is still superior . i look forward to britannica making the interface and ease of use better in future productions and that is why i am only able to award 4 stars
1	registry mechanic is a great registry tool . it works better than the registry tools included with symantec system works . if you purchase this version at 5.1 you can get a free upgrade to the latest version 6.0 once you register the product . try the evaluation and you will see how many registry errors your machine may have that can effect its performance
1	actually , comic book creator lets you use your content in a million different ways , including reselling of your work . the only limitation is that you ca n't sell comics created around branded content -- like images from marvel , paramount , tokyopop , etc. -- because they do n't allow that . it 's all in the user agreement . check it out
1	this is a good computer bible , but for the money , i prefer a program like amg bible essentials which has the libronix library system built-in and can be integrated with other bible study software . for about $ 15 more the amg program has both kjv , apocrypha and nasb , including a lot of other capability , like greek translations , word study , exegesis , parallel bible comparisons , etc . the rainbow bible is an older issue and shows its age by not offering features as mentioned above . some benefits of this bible include both niv and kjv translations , color maps , matthew henry 's commentary , naves and a version of foxe 's book of martyrs . the various colors can be distracting at times , but overall it is worth considering , particularly if you like the niv
1	absolutely love this program . i 'd been using norton for years and so was initially hesitant to switch . its not as user friendly as norton and has the annoying habit of repeatedly asking for permission even after it has been granted . on the upside this feature adds to its efficiency and gives the user complete control over all internet activity , making it an exceptionally good security program .
1	there are complaints about win xp sp2 being too expensive or complaints about technical problems . it is too expensive , but it is the standard at so many companies , big and small , around the world . i just wanted to say that anyone who gives windows xp sp2 a one star rating really does n't understand much about the windows operating system , and therefore you should not take into consideration their uneducated opinion about operating systems in general . the price is a bit high , but windows is what it is ... a dominant operating system
1	encarta users will have no problem using and enjoying the newest version of encarta - 2007 it is just as informative as the last versions with a lot of extra kicks , like the newest videos . recommend at least 1 gb of ram and a pentium 4 processor with a newer video card ( 2 yrs or better ) for the best video viewing it will run on older system
0	the program does a great job in figuring my taxes . but now intuit is charging for filing and the state program . also i was unable to download the updates over my dial-up connection . i called to have a cd version mailed to me but so far i have n't received it . i 'm trying tax act this year . it is a free program and has free filing . if i can complete the turbotax version i will see if i can duplicate my return using tax act . if so then good bye turbotax
0	do not order this . tech support from broderbund is basically non-existant . one sorry product
0	office 97 was a pretty good product . the programs were powerful , had a decent interface ( maybe not as good as the claris products of the early 1990s , but not bad ) , and came with a ton of features all on one disc . the office 98 release for mac was pretty much the same thing . the only thing that really got annoying for me was the office assistant ( paperclip ) but it is easy enough to turn off . office 2000 was a bit of a disappointment for me . i felt that the improvements were minimal ( aside from a bit more stability in word -- anyone who has ever used word 97 on a regular basis knows it 's prone to crashing ) and in fact detracted from the ease of use . one example is the clip gallery , which went from being one of the best organizers ever created to becoming a program that would n't have received decent reviews in 1988 . another is powerpoint 's outline feature . i always turned this off because it ate up monitor space and therefore made the actual slide smaller . when you use smaller displays like i often do this is a problem . the menus , which hide some functions until you go to the bottom of them , were also an annoyance . the manual went from being a nice thick book to one half the size . office 2003 continues making the program uglier . now there are many tasks crammed onto one little panel on the right of the screen . again , this eats into the workspace . the clip art system is even more cumbersome , and many of the clips are online only now . the help feature tries to point too much in the online direction as well . now some people may not complain , but what if you 're using a laptop in the middle of the country ? i feel that the program is basically an uglier version of the same thing that was first seen in 1997 . in fact , the 1997 version was more pleasant to work with and almost as powerful . on my macs , i 've switched to keynote for presentations and pages for some of my word processing because the new office versions on that platform are similar . some of the templates also look very 1997 . apple 's programs are updated on a regular basis , and their templates look very modern . now i know microsoft adds some new ones now and then , but they should consider redesigning many of them -- such as replacing the overused arial and times new roman fonts with something a little more classy . the program is bloated way too heavily . i can run office 2000 comfortably on a 486 with sub-1gb hard drive , but ca n't even get 2003 on it . a final gripe is that access is not user friendly at all . file maker is a better alternative , as it is easier to use and friendlier
1	this new nancy drew game was fun to play ! it was shipped on time and arrived in good condition .
0	do n't waste your time and money ! ! extremely poor product support ! 60 day return policy which they exploit by trying to solve your problems and delaying past the 60 day limit , then you 're stuck with worthless software . i installed it on my computer making a complete backup of it . then my computer crashed and i lost everything . i thought i was covered since i just made a full backup on an external hard disk but when i tried to do a restore norton ghost would n't recognize my external hard disk . i spent a full day with their support people and he finally gave up telling me he had to send the problem to the next level of support and that they would call me within 48 hours . nobody called ! i bought their extended download service and tried to download the product again . it did n't work and after spending 8 hours online and on the phone i still have n't got a working copy . the product key they said i needed and i tried to use also does n't work . i 'm writing my credit card company next to try and get a credit but i expect the same result - no credit back and software that does n't do what norton said it would do
0	based on lots of great reviews , i decided to buy kaspersky . after two months , i got a message saying my activation key was blacklisted . i sent an email to customer service and got an auto reply saying they were too busy to respond within 48 hours . finally after three days someone got back to me and told me to try deleting and reentering the key . this did not work . i had to reply again to customer service and got the same auto reply . this time , no one ever replied . i sent another email threatening to write negative reviews of them and they still , weeks later , have not replied . i emphatically advise against buying this product . if you ever have a problem , you will not get help
1	this is a good package for backing up your pc . fairly intuitive , although it took me a couple tries to figure out what the software was doing so i could select the right stuff to backup . it uses good compression to minimize the amount of disk for your backup . the downside of that is you ca n't just select a file to restore , you must go through the restore process . you can select a single file , but it takes a bit of time . runs automatically and unobtrusively so it wo n't interfere with your current work .
0	this software never worked after installation using the cd i bought it ask me to extend my preview `` your preview using this feature has expired to continue using purchase the full version today '' i have tried to contact the seller in vain . this is very unfortunite for such people to continue hacking customers money with under rated product
1	it would be nice if the contents were listed , with all of microsoft 's versions , it gets confusing
1	i bought finale songwriter to make lead sheets with chord symbols . it worked well for my project . i have no complaints .
0	this program sucks . i used it last year and thought that it was unwieldy and really confusing ( i.e . unlike turbotax and other programs , there 's very little transparency in the system ) . then i bought it again this year because the store that i went to was out of turbotax , and i needed to get my taxes done quickly . this year was even worse than last year - not only was it still unwieldy and irritating , but it gave me figures that simply did not make sense . the results for the federal return were ok , but it gave me figures that would have cost me over $ 2,000 in taxes that i did not owe on my state return . i ended up going online to double check my results using a cheap ( $ 10 ) online service recommended by the ny state tax website . within 45 minutes , i cleared the online source , and got results that made far more sense . i have no idea what happened with taxcut , but i suspect that they may have been missing a field somewhere along the line - this is a problem that has been noted by a number of others in reviews on a variety of sites . i will not be buying this product again
1	we purchased this for my 6 year old son and 7 year old daughter since both children have been asking me to help teach them how to play chess the last several months . while i have been able to get them started , i find that approach used in this software to introduce the game pieces and concepts has allowed their understanding of the game to grow . both kids enjoy using this software and , if i would let them , would spend hours at a time using the software . my biggest issue with the software is the sound and animation . we continually have issues with the sound/animation not being in sync or the audio cutting in and out . we run this on a computer with plenty of processing power , memory , disk space , etc . it does not bother this kids too much , but i find it annoying . all in all , a great tool to help my children learn the game .
0	the first version of easy cd creator i used was cd creator 4 basic . it was okay , pretty much what it said it was : basic . i got the upgrade to that from an ebay auction and it worked pretty good . later due to lack of support by the manufacturer for new cdrw drives in good old version 4 , i upgraded to cd creator 5 platinum ( the version being sold here . ) this too worked pretty good - for a little while . then the operation was moved over from adaptec to roxio , and from that point onward , things have been more thorny than rosy . roxio will require you to register the product in order to download the ( one ) utterly essential update to keep this thing running . perhaps you do n't mind that , but i feel it 's a somewhat minor invasion of privacy . plus you have to keep track of your password to the website and if you change isp 's you will have to re-register . a hassle to say the least . also , since roxio took the reins , there are no further updates being provided . instead roxio tries to `` encourage '' ( read `` browbeat '' ) you into getting the software upgrade for even more money . this upgrade will not work on win98se , which i still use for various reasons . so if i were to upgrade the software again , i would also have to spend the extra money for a new operating system with all the faults and foibles that can introduce with other apps that i need and still use . if you have money to burn along with all those shiny round coasters you are going to be making , i applaud you . i prefer to keep a little cash for retirement . it is difficult if not impossible to get support from any real carbon-based life form , and the website gives little or no support for some of the issues you may face , such as getting `` illegal request '' errors from direct cd , or inability to format or erase cdrw 's that was once possible in version 4 . also , any cdrw 's created in version 4 may not be readable with the new software , or at the least there are some technical issues with this . at any rate , it is not neccessarily all that `` easy '' unless you are fairly technically inclined and understand ( or are willing to learn ) some of the finer technical points in cd recording technology . i prefer not to be bothered with it , i just want to create some cds . i now find that some functions do not work appropriately at all , especially direct cd , a program that originally provided the ability to do `` drag and drop '' writing of files to a read/write cd . now i find that direct cd is non-functional , and the only cd 's i can write are cdr 's , and there are problems growing in that area as well . speed of the cdrw or brand of the recording media does not seem to be the issue . the software simply refuses to work as it once did . it should n't be called `` easy cd creator '' . perhaps `` irritating '' cd creator would be more appropriate . in summary : this does not deserve stars . perhaps a few `` black holes '' ? while i once would have given wholehearted supported this product , regrettably i can not support it with the same enthusiasm now .
0	the graphics are clear , but they are bad ! horses look nothing like that and it is really gross ! i would say get it for the younger kids , because they wo n't care . there is nothing to do with the game except earn money , build your hotel , and keep your horse from getting sick . you do n't get to ride that often because it said `` you have ridden enough for this round '' and it is very enoying . you ca n't pay enough monay to keep more than one horse , but you need to jump them to earn money so you can build your hotel / parking lot / jumping corse / breeding paddock / ect . but you ca n't do that unless you can jump the horse alot , and you ca n't . it is easy to go 'bankrupt ' so i would say this game is not for little kids because of the money dealing . not for older kids because of the dumbness of the horses look , not for younger kids because of the money problems . so do n't get this game
0	i 've been a loyal user of systemworks ( also `` utilities '' antivirus ) for many years , frequently buying upgrades as i moved through various windows oss . the latest verison ( 2006 ) has been a big disappointment . 1 ) the `` integrator '' repeatedly crashes ( and `` must shut down '' ) . i was told to reintall ( it took 4 hours ) . tech support ( email ) was slow and barely intelligible . 2 ) the full scan now takes over 8 hours on a modest sized system . 3 ) the utilities have not been substantially improved in 5 years 4 ) the rebate ( for upgrade users ) came in the form of a debit card , not a check . ( what a hassle ! i do n't want any more `` plastic '' ! ) 5 ) turning the norton protection off substantially speeds up my pc . what the heck is going on back there ? during the next year , i 'll be looking for a new anti-virus support product . cheers , joh
0	once i figured this software out , i was able to do a slideshow of my pictures , integrate video , and produce a decent dvd . only problem is , it distorts all my video footage by forcing it into 4:3 whereas my dvd camcorder shoots in 16:9 . this sucks . i have been buying other software packages ever since trying to get my video to stay in 16:9 . roxio support did e-mail me back with the blanket statement that it does n't support 16:9 at this time . even in the new 7.5 version . roxio needs to join the rest of us in 2005 and bring their software to be compatible in widescreen
0	card studio 2007 has repeated many cards from card studio 2006 . i bought this new program to have more of a selection but was very disappointed . also is is very difficult to see the cards when they are bunched . you have to pick a card in order to read the front . very time consuming
1	i really enjoy using this program , much better than what was out there 5 - 10 years ago when i last worked on genealogy . i love the ancestry.com feature , it is wonderful to go find your grandparents , great-grandparents and even great-great grandparents in the us census . i have found out a few things that i did n't know , unfortunately my mother recently passed away , and i have no one to verify some of it with . i would suggest that anyone contemplating this program gets it now , and starts working while you still have elders who can help you sort through the information you find . i also found a family tree out there from someone who only lives a few blocks from where we used to live . she has traced her family back to the 1500 's in germany ... and it appears that they are related to us . it was strange to go to her website and find a picture of my great grandparents headstone . it was just another branch of the family . buy it
1	purchased this edition of taxcut last week . on win xp2 the software installed cleanly and it downloaded the updates without any issues . i imported last year 's data in less than a minute and i had my return completed in less than 1 hour . this includes capital gains/losses , dividends , and amt calculations . it does n't get much easier than this . yes , you have to download updates . the irs is still making changes to the tax codes long after this software has to be packaged and sent to the stores . the alternative would be to download the whole package online when you buy it , but would n't that take at least as long
1	this program is positively wonderful for word practice and pronunciation with a number of flash-card style game and a very elegant listen-record-replay interface . while the two characters do pronounce words slightly differently , hearing those variations really helps to understand the phonetics in a way that a single voice would lack . however , this really is more of a companion tool for a more traditional course . i purchased this with `` colloquial icelandic '' and would definitely recommend purchasing them together . there are some extremely strange spelling/pronunciation variations and without having a written explanation of these things , you may be left staring in great confusion as the characters read phrases on screen -- `` hva '' is pronounced `` kwah ? '' what ? having `` colluquial icelandic '' to turn to for explanation helped a great deal . that package has two audio cds of alphabet , number , vocabulary and conversation exercises with a very well-written 370 page coursebook . i gave this product a 5-star rating as it is superb for its intended purpose , but it does not stand alone as a complete course
1	purchased this to help navigate a trip from northern michigan to south-west florida and back again . we took a fair amount of side trips and having this on our laptop made it easy to get to where we wanted to go . there were a couple of times that we went `` off route '' but were back on route in very little time . it helped us decide where to stop for fuel , eat and sleep . up-to-date information is available with an internet connection and the larger map-viewing area was greatly appreciated . well worth the price . highly recommended to others
0	when i first installed the program i was able to access the images , but since that first time i have n't . my operating system is xp and i do n't know if that is the problem with the software . i have since then uninstalled it . i did not think this product was very easy to use
1	july 27 , 2005 why have n't i heard about the mia characters before ? i bought this for my god daughters 6th birthday without knowing anything about the game . we opened it together and i was blown away with the 3d animation-the same quality as pixar . everyone at the party was glued to the computer screen in this adventure land game . best of all , its educational but because it was so entertaininng , my god-daughter has not stopped playing it . well worth your money ! i 'm going to buy the rest of the mia series
1	i have had my computer for a couple of years now , and i have always wondered if there was ever a product out there to help me rid my computer of waste . well this product was recommended to me by a family member , and i am impressed as to how well it does ! ! i have never had so much success with one all-in-one product as i have the system mechanic 6 professional , and the fact that it came with virus protection was and added bonus for me too . if your computer is slower than slow i definately recommend that you use this product to get rid of the unnecessary junk on your system , and keep up to date with the latest viruses out there . i do n't think i will ever go back to mccafee again !
0	i purchased this updated version 1/5/07 . it does not print correctly , and technical support assured me that the developer is `` working on the problem '' and a `` fix '' is soon to come . this is march 1 , and no update is available yet . this program is un-usable and i am very unhappy and would not recommend `` as is '' to anyone . i have the 2005 edition and was very pleased with it . this is a large embarrassment to the hallmark company
1	ok , it is big ( 4 cdrs ) . and a full install will require over 2.35 gb . but it loads quickly and offers nice greeting card variety along with pretty sophisticated card customization options on all pages of the card . as in previous years , it also installs event planner . if you do n't want to use event planner you can stop it from starting with windows by going to start / all programs / startup group and deleting the entry for event planner from the startup group but if you do n't have a similar program , you might find event planner to be useful . i found setting up this program for my auto-duplexing ricoh color laser printer easy enough to do , so setting it up for other printers will likely be pretty easy also . the quality of the printed cards is really astounding , even my normally `` picky '' wife thinks they look very nice and acceptable for any use . i suppose your results could depend on your printer but if your printer currently prints nice graphics and pictures , then the cards should turn out very nice . i recommend using heavy card stock for a professional looking final product . cards that default to printing out in the 1/4 sheet size ( four fold ) format can easily be printed at 1/2 fold size and the graphics and text remain outstanding . i never experimented with the `` partial install '' that would require disk swapping but save hd space , so i can not if that would be a nuisance or not . overall , there is nothing i 've found about the program that i do n't like .
1	i have been a long time user of delorme products but decided to get a combination of microsoft products both for the us and europe ( autotrip ) . the program loaded very smoothly , but do make sure you load the program before plugging in the gps locator . there are multiple warnings about this as well as what to do if you do n't follow directions . i loaded all the data on my laptop so i would not have to carry the dvd . the setup was also quite simple . there are warnings about usage in an automobile that pop up in use ( as well as the cautions during setup ) . one needs to keep this in mind and not be distracted when driving . i set the mapping program and forget it . but it works best with two people in the car with one to navigate . the gps locator has a great chipset . very , very sensitive and quickly finds the coordinates within seconds , even as i sit in my house . it rarely loses a lock on the satellite . the route finding works well , so far . you can save your track as well as the route , but unlike the delorme products you ca n't playback your track ( or if you can , i have not found it ) . the screen is pleasing and you go fullscreen . i have n't tried voice recognition but the spoken commands are about average . the ability ot overlay satellite photographs when planning routes with an internet connection is a plus . plus you can routinely update road construction sites . so far , no opinion on how good that feature is . the microsoft location finder internet leaves something to be desired though i 've only tried it at home . it routinely thinks i 'm in china ( which is interesting because so many ads are quite able to figure out where i am ) . the gps also works with other programs by selecting a generic nema gps . there are other optional equipment to go with the gps . if you 've never used a gps mapping program with a laptop , microsoft s is a good choice . just do n't be surprised if the gps lcates you accurately and the microsoft locator product puts you on the other side of the planet .
0	i have always used norton products , and upgraded to is 2007 when my subscription came up for renewal . what a mistake . my computer freezes up all the time , and the software is difficult to use- it is not at all straightforward like previous versions of internet security . do not buy this product .
0	this is the first time i have ever reviewed a product and i do it so that no one else will waste their money on this . it adds virtually nothing to xp . too bad they did n't make it as interesting as their packaged media edition . that would have been worth the money , but old bill who does n't want to be the richest man in the world would rather you spend money on a new pc to get that product . the themes are nice but far too few for the price . the games are a gimmick since you have to pay to play the real things . the dj is dumb and the dancers are cute but after a while boring . hard to figure out how to use the music converter and photo stuff . too bad could have been something but in its present form , not worth the money
1	a great bargain - you get full office professional , vp and full version of windows for under $ 300 dollars . after waiting for months and months for office 2004 professional to be released , when it finally came out i was ecstatic . one problem : vp 7.0 would n't install on my g5 , only on my laptop . i called microsoft support and within minutes they told me that they were working on a patch for machines with over 2.0 gb of ram . i downloaded the update a week later when it came out and everything is now golden . the moral of the story is that microsoft underestimates the needs of mac users because they are used to wimpy pcs that have no ram
1	i was afraid at first not to order directly from adobe but decided to take the cheaper route . it was obviously worth it - everything arrived perfectly - wrapped up , original cd set , etc . shipped in record time as well . eyal
0	this computer system , although almost universally accepted , can be beaten in quality and flexibility by an operating system that can be downloaded for free , such as the fedora project ( a distribution of linux , a os which can be changed by anyone for free ) , or bought from software company supporting these open source project with unlimited customer support for around ï¿½50 ( $ 90 ) or less
0	i was extremely disappointed in this `` upgrade '' . i had roxio 's easy cd creator 5 and loved it . that product allowed you to easily arrange your music on the dics , burn it , then create a lable or insert for the disc with almost no effort . almost everything was intuitive . creator 7 is a big step back in ease of use and utility . so they added a few new bells and whistles , so what ? the base use of this product is to make music cd 's and to create inserts . arranging music is not as easy as it was before . and the insert creator is so frustrating to use i do n't bother . in fact , i have continued to use creator 5 and have simply written off the fact i paid $ 100 for creator 7 - for nothing ! now , with a computer upgrade , creator 5 no longer works . i do n't dare try another roxio product ( just read the reviews for 7.5 and that appears to be a total waste of money ) . i 'll be taking my chances on anything else . . . not roxio
1	this is going to be a great program that will benefit our family in producing fantastic photos and films
0	i do n't have a problem with the software . it pretty much does what we need but reversing an error can be a nightmare . before i start this tirade , i should point out that the customer service reps were very nice . but they do n't have the infrastructure to provide the most basic level of service ( please , read on ) . the customer support system for the payroll upgrade on this product is really scary . ( 1 ) they want to have access to your checking account to pay for the annual payroll subscription ! ! ( 2 ) they do not send receipts ! ! i help with the books for a small non-profit and paid for the payroll subscription on my own credit card . the only receipt i could get was a copy of the invoice , which is not formatted to print correctly on an hp1200 ( duh ! ! ) . what is really disturbing is that these people are supposed to be accounting experts ! if you acquiesce to the checking account withdrawal , the only receipt you receive is the line item on your bank statement . have they every heard of a `` paper trail '' . well you sure wo n't get one if you purchase the payroll subscription for this product . i will start looking for an alternative to intuit because they obviously do n't understand some basic accounting and auditing principles .
1	i 've used paperport 9 for about 3 years , currently running under win xp . i love it , my wife loves it , i have bought it for my kids , and recommend it to others . a lawyer friend of mine raves about it . i 've had no problems with it . ( i had to downlaod and install an upgrade , but more recent production probably has the upgrade already incorporated . ) i download bank and credit card statements and other documents to it from the internet ; i store faxed documents in it ; i scan checks before i deposit them ; i use it to convert documents to pdf so i can e-mail them . the only reason i did n't give it 5 stars is that i wish it were more convenient to do a couple of things ; maybe v. 10 adds those features , but for the money , v.9 is a bargain . i just wish i had a faster scanner ( what do you expect for $ 60 ? ) so i could get rid of more paper documents . highly recommended as a start toward the paperless office
1	i decided to get this office suite after using it recently . i 've usually worked on office 97 and 2000 , but the 2003 version has some pretty cool features not found in the older versions . the feature that i really enjoy is the pivot report feature in ms access , which was n't in ms access 2000 . this is a truly great reporting feature . you can now use access as a front-end to slice and dice data stored on data warehouses in oracle , sql server , sybase and other enterprise-type databases . if you 're used to creating crosstab reports , you 'll definitely like the pivot report feature . crosstabs are limited to 2 dimensions but there 's no limitation on the number of dimensions in pivot report . to me , the main drawback is the price . ( i did get mine at around $ 370 at j , which is a great price . ) i figure i can upgrade this in about 5 years time , which works out to about $ 70 to $ 75 per year ( assuming that i 'll be paying about $ 370 to upgrade in 5 years time . ) a big positive is that this is the industry standard . so the work you put into learning the multiple new features of word , excel , ms access is not wasted because you can reuse the same skills in another job . your time will be well spent . note that the software may seem bloated but the intelligent user is able to choose and pick the most useful and relevant features of each application and ignore the features that are not useful . different features are useful to different people ... another positive : each product in office professional is fully programmable using visual basic for applications ( vba ) which you can use to build custom programs . this very powerful feature is sometimes overlooked when shopping for office suites .
1	i only installed the product two days ago and have not really been able to give it a solid workout . that said , my initial take is very positive . as a writer and lousy typist , i think it will increase my productivity expotentially . i look forward to really getting into the nuts and bolts of the product very soon
1	i have been using microsoft operating systems for a very long time , and , i still say that this is the best system out there , for many reasons . an increasing amount of linux and mac users have made the claim that they are more compatible with programs , and are less vulnerable to virus and hacks . in response to linux users- stay away from linux , linux is free for a reason . it is compatible with very very few programs as it is , and that number will only decrease . for gamers - rarley do i see a linux compatible game . just stay away from this system . for mac users- mac 's also have a lesser amount of compatible programs . fewer and fewer programs can run on them , and like linux , that number will only decrease . the only thing keeping macintosh alive is itunes . which is compatible with windows . besides , when direct x 10 comes out , it will only be available for windows , making macintosh 's un-usable for new games when the next windows os comes out ( microsoft vista ) . the computers are also generally more expensive than windows . btw - you can get viruses on mac 's
1	i thought that i could never learn piano on my own . all the material that i ever looked into either did n't have enough information in it or was too complicated for its own good . because of this software , i am constantly learning new things , and slowly improving my skills as a future pianist . if you are a beginner , you want to buy this software . it 's done wonders for me
1	switched from panda anti-virus to this one . great software , very sensitive settings . it was quite aggrevating at first getting constantly interrupted in other programs to be told of various things going on . finally got each feature individually adjusted to settings i can live with , and it works great . they could improve the filtration time ( long ) to analyze your computer ( i only have a 40gig hd with about 20gig used ) as it takes about 20-25 mins . to do the complete cleansing process . however , first time i ran it after having run panda for the last time , it caught 2 undetected trojans panda missed . it also isolated a hidden file trying to access the internet for `` updates '' that i still have not been able to identify , but it 's zapped . overall , best i 've seen so far , and you can install it on up to 3 computers from one cd ( just name each installation with a different username to accomplish , all perfectly legal with the 3 user cd deal ) . i have 3 laptops covered at a cost of about $ 13 each - i 'll take that all day long
0	there 's a reason why this stuff is significantly discounted . this is definitely one of the worst products i have ever bought . i did not do much research . i think the data may be in there , but i could not learn how to make it work . the interface is horrific - unusable . do n't do it
1	this product did an excellent job of figuring our taxes . this is the first time we 've tried something like this and found it very easy to follow and complete . you can go back and change things or review them , it gives you a way to e-file , you can print out all the copies that you may need . i was surprised how easy it was to use . however it took us a long time because we read all the items very carefully and double checked everything but it saved us a lot of money from what we used to pay our tax preparer . i was very happy with it
0	i rarely write reviews but i decided to write this since i had this urge to let everyone know that this product is just plain bad . the review by `` reviewer : rc lansing mich '' has listed all of my frustrations and i will not go over them again . but the rating of 4 stars that he has given does not agree with what you will read in his review . the summary of this product is that it is `` highly unusable '' . you will be tired of using this on your first trip that you will not feel like every using it again . yes , you can `` manage '' you way with this product . however it is not worth your time and money . and last point that struck a nerve with me about the ols maps database ... the company came out with a plan where customers can send them updated maps , based on locations they have travelled , not covered by the original map database ... come on !
1	i recently wrote a review for this item due to a launching issue . very angry , i made numerous calls and emails to nova . at last i was able to converse with a rep who was more than helpful and made right with all my issues . i am pleased with my outcome with nova and the response , making sure i was a satisfied customer . i only rate this 4 stars as i am just now using the program and am very excited with what i 've been able to accomplish in the past 3 days . thank you nova for your help
1	i have had .mac for years and enjoyed using its functions . i have a number of photo pages hosted as well as some iweb sites . plus i use it for syncing and backup , etc . i am not a power user , however . but it 's a great utility and particularly when you have other family members who you want to have access it some of its features easily .
1	i am so satisfied with this trendmicro security system , that i highly recommend it to everyone . without mentioning my previous system , this is tops ! i have never felt so secure before getting this system . thank you for being able to supply me with it . i hope through word of mouth and mail , that i have caused others to go for it . i do know of 3 people at least who are changing . thank you again
0	i 've used paperport for years mostly because it was the best of a bunch of poor options . however , version 11 is buggier than earlier versions : every time i launch a microsoft office product , the paperport installer starts up . there is no reference to this in the paperport help file or in the ridiculously inadequate knowledgebase on the paperport site . another bug imprints a `` trial copy '' legend on your pdf files . this one is explained in the knowledgebase , but requires you to tinker with the registry to correct it . that 's a bit ridiculous . why are they distributing code with a known bug ? nuance expects you to pay $ 9.95 for e-mail technical support - even if it 's a bug in their own product . the product is a modest performer at best , but nuance 's awful technical support policies are the real sinker here . i 've requested an rma for a refund . jerr
0	purchased this software because i got a deal with a special price break . i have a very small business , so a purchase of several hundred dollars needs to pay back quickly . the set up took a lot longer than i had anticipated . the customer service was no help - could n't answer my questions . i ended up spending 6 hours to get everything right - another day wasted . i 've got myself stuck with this now and will use for a few months since i 've spent the money , but i 'm going to look for alternatives in the meantime . if this is `` quick books , '' i need to find `` lightning fast '' books somewhere
1	i currently have version 1.0 on my pc . it does everything it claims to and does it flawlessly . it cleans internet cache , history , cookies and more ! i 've tried another internet privacy program , but it failed to clean up the tracks that this program successfully cleaned . i especially like the fact that it cleans the autocomplete entries in my internet search and internet browser . others can use my pc , and wo n't be able to see what documents i 've recently opened , which programs i 've recently run , or what i 've searched for and what sites i 've visited online . and that 's the way it should be ! this program can be set to clean up this information securely ( can be set to wipe not just delete the info ) . another plus , it can clean usage tracks for all users on a pc . the program i tried on my other pc only worked with administrator accounts ( and not very well may i ad )
1	i would recommand this software to anyone that burns dvd/cd . it is user friendly and easy to navigate
1	coreldraw was my first foray into vector graphics back when version 3 showed up on my desk at the small `` mom and pop '' screenprinting shop i worked at . back then , corel came with oodles of free fonts , clipart , manuals ... not to mention free technical support via a toll-free number . i stayed with corel exclusively until version 10 ... enduring countless patches , bugs and the dreaded `` odd-numbered '' curse ( if you tried version 5 or 7 , you feel my pain ) . adobe photoshop was always my photo-editing program of choice ... corelphotopaint just never quite `` did it '' for me . industry demands eventually delegated that i delve into adobe illustrator . being already familiar with adobe photoshop 's features , tools and `` look and feel '' , illustrator did n't present a huge , overbearing learning curve . in illustrator , i found the same robust features as coreldraw ... which was n't what impressed me about illustrator . adobe 's intuitive programs , and their ability to interact with one another ... seamlessly ... that is what won me over to illustrator . illustrator 's ability to edit/create pdf 's in their native format ? wow ! exporting layered vector files to photoshop ... with layers intact ? ? ? wow ! ! ! ( i could go on ) now , that being said ... there are still things that i prefer in coreldraw compared to illustrator . the extrude function in corel is much easier to utilize . the powerclip function is more user friendly than illustrator 's `` make clipping mask '' function . the ability to customize/edit/add shortcut keys is an amazing feature . ( again ... i could go on ) in regards to importing and exporting files from other applications , coreldraw wins , hands down . it boasts a robust set of import and export filters , my favorite being the .eps import filter which lets you import an .eps while converting the fonts to curves during the import . this is a must have if you work with an .eps file created on another computer whose fonts you lack . if i had a dollar for every .eps that pulls into illustrator with fonts blown out ... i 'd be independently wealthy . why illustrator has never implemented this is beyond me . so , to sum it up ... coreldraw is a great program ... but i ca n't imagine it being my only vector drawing program . just like in real life , you need a great team . this program , paired with adobe creative suite , meets my needs perfectly .
1	poser user since version 3 . poser continues to improve . more life-like , faster
0	far from user-friendly , you will be at the office later at night tearing out your hair trying to find the buttons on the tool bar for even the simplest of office tasks , wondering `` why did i get this program again ? '' its like reading another language after using previous editions of word , which i was a big fan of . i guess with some extensive getting used to the it might be nice but for now it 's a nuisance . i ca n't find anything on this toold bar that looks like an airplane cockpit . in the words of thoreau `` simplify . '' good luck sending files as attachments to colleagues-they wo n't be able to view the newere version . get used to saving in `` 97-2003 word format . '' also , wo n't comply with other programs such as e-fax unless saved in this manner . at this price , you could do without the headache .
0	i purchased this program for my personal and home business tax return but it did not include all the forms needed so i had to buy another version from them . h taxcut included all i needed and was 1/2 the price
1	in general ... this program worked very well . i 've had a hard time putting my new dual core pentium d computer in the raid 1 configuration , so i bought this instead . the clone function works extremely well and is an adequate alternative to the raid 1 configuration , but i was a bit confused about how to use the `` incremental backup '' function . the initial backup went well , but when i went back for incremental backup additions , it would tell me it was `` impossible '' ... .so i just clone the c drive every few weeks now . i have two seagate 320 gb sata hard drives , and it 's great to know that i have an exact copy of the c drive if i fry it . i live in ethiopia , so the power fluctuations are frequent and disastorous . i 've already lost one hard drive to power flux abnormalities . i 'd buy this product again , and it 's comforting to know that it 's on my system and that i can back up my valuable data easily and quickly when i need to
0	office 2007 may seem ok at first . the menus are all ok for me to use , so i do n't have to build menus from scratch . but after installing the trial , i found numerous complaints that would make me want to trash it if i had it . 1 ) word does n't want to integrate with outlook very well 2 ) everytime i want to send a mail message i accidentally click on 'paste ' 3 ) the flags and categories for outlook are annoying and just add to the time spent administering email without helping me more than outlook 2003 4 ) along with all of the other microsoft products i 've tried in the past month , it hangs , corrupts its own files , and generally takes up too much memory . i 'll stick with office 2003 , which does n't have nearly as many flaws . there is no reason for me to upgrade . i 'm also back to ie6 , money 2006 , and will not upgrade to vista . i 've lost volumes of emails because i ca n't downgrade my outlook files . good job in alienating your customers , microsoft . ( so what 's new ?
0	this maybe the worst interface i have ever had the displeasure of working with and that includes console applications with dos interfaces . edlin and fdisk are more user friendly than the mcafee 's security center . there is noway to disable the software except by uninstalling the program or opening xp 's admin tools and then forcing the services to stop , which is not a recommenable approach for the average user . here is a short list of the probelms that i encountered . counter spy is cheaper , easier to use and has an interface that is user friendly ! * can not select to disable during non-internet use so i can run software that security center has conflicts with like protools 7.3 recording software . * the scan results are vague , ie returns 6 quarantined threats but does n't display what the threats are and you ca n't print the result either . * there are more ... ... there are some good features but the detractors win by a land slide .
0	the benefits may be great , but the exercises are so boring that it is way too much effort to do them on a regular basis
1	this product is a very simple to use , extremely efficient tool . i am very pleased with results it produced for me
0	why buy iolo system mechanic when you can get malware for free ? i installed pro 7 and it gave many , many problems . iolo did not respond to my emails so i uninstalled . their uninstaller did not work either
0	ok ! being the richest human being on the planet called earth , bill gates decided that he 's not wealthy enough . so he released this microsoft office 2003 , which i really think is not much different from previous edition . the price is , as usual , very expensive . what 's worse is that bill gates decided all the pre-installed windows in new laptops and desktops come with the trial version . so mere mortals like us need to spend extra big money buying the full version to simply do some basic documents . i can see bill gates , being a deified bloodsucker , using $ 100 dollar bills as toilet paper , and laughing at us who work their butt off just to make enough money to live . so shame on you bill gates and microsoft
1	this is a wonderful and very useful program , not only for school age kids but also for adults . it is full of useful information . it comes very handy when you want to learn about anything . look for any topic , you will find it there
0	the program works fine on windows xp and is easy to use . it lets you print cards of many sizes . the big disappointment is in the number of cards that comes with the program . the back of the box claims `` 4500+ cards and sentiments , celebrate life 's special moments with cards for all occasions '' . that 's nice . the problem with that is that i counted the total number of cards that come with the program . it only adds up to 1045 ! so where are the other 3450+ cards and sentiments ? are you supposed to design them yourself ? i just do n't know . and certainly `` cards for all occasions '' means just that , does n't it ? well there 's lots of birthday cards and plenty of holiday cards but not one sympathy card of any kind . i guess you just need to buy those on your own
1	i purchased panda internet security 2007 for two reasons : the price after rebates ( free ) and the fact that it is a 3-user license . after switching from mcafee to norton ( and a subsequent 1-year renewal ) i decided to either buy pc-cillin 2007 or try panda . ( 39.99 or free ... hmm ... ) i installed panda on my laptop first ( after uninstalling norton internet security 2005 ) . no problem what-so-ever . in the initial hdd scan , panda found and cleaned 5 files that were found in my email inbox identified as a worm . i then installed panda on 2 desktop machines with no problems there either . panda found 3 traces of spyware on one machine and nothing on the second . panda boots up with windows xp quickly . it has only given me a couple of pop-up messages ( one for a wifi intrusion , which was another computer on my network ... i accepted it and it never came back . the other pop-up was to start on-line customer service or something like that ... i declined it and it has yet to come back . ) my laptop is a p4 1.8ghz , 1gb ram , 32mb ati video , 40gb hdd . the initial virus scan took less than 20 minutes , scanning over 250,000 files . not bad ! desktop 1 's first scan ( p4 2.4ghz , 512mb , 128mb video , 120gb hdd ) scanned nearly 300,000 files also under 20 minutes . desktop 2 was the quickest ( p4 3.4ghz , 1gb , 128mb video , 80gb hdd ) scanning over 330,000 files in about 15 minutes . i am extremely impressed with panda internet security 2007 . it 's everything i hoped it would be . i would definitely recommend this product to others
0	if you use microsoft office ( word , excel ) do n't buy it ! links to your previous .pdf simply do n't work . adobe knows about it , but have no viable work around . stick with prevous versions .
0	if i could give it 0 star , i would . my humble opinion is that kaspersky is not better than norton at slowing down your computer . one brand new computer , plenty of space and memory . one old computer but with plenty of space and memory as well . each time kaspersky updates , i ca n't open outlook express nor explorer . well , the programs do open actually but i have time to vacuum and dust before they 're launched . i used the repair fonction and uninstalled and reinstalled without any improvement . samwis
0	buyer beware . if you encounter a technical issue with this product and require a refund , you 're out of luck . they will send you in endless circles attempting to get a product refund . there are many other good products out there that do the same thing . it 's really easy to purchase , but impossible to get a refund
0	what a terrible upgrade . i 'm going to uninstall it and go back to 6 . even though i specifically told it to leave my file associations alone , it changed every one of them . it 's a nightmare . i 'm still trying to get nero disassociated with certain file types , to no avail . the backup program is awful , slow and much more difficult to use than the one built into 6 . overall , ultra 6 is a much better product . i 'm going to uninstall 7 and send it back to nero with instructions on where they can associate it
0	i received the package and read the instructions . in retrospect there were hints buried there that indicated this may not go well . it did not . my installation stalled out and would not complete rendering the computer useless . i had to take it to a professional to get it going . even so , i have had problems with internet explorer stopping suddenly , bsod 's . this is not a job for the average computer user
0	i trusted that this software would do what it claimed to do and was so let down by its lack of performance that i am dumbfounded and left speechless . during backup process i selected about 15gb of info to backup , spanning 4 dvds . everything looked fine , except for two ( 2 ) simple errors that i received , indicating that those related files may not have been copied/backed up properly . i figured no big deal , 2 files/errors out 15gb , i could handle that . based upon the false pretenses that my critical info was backed up properly ( simple pictures , videos , mp3 files and financial files to include previous years tax files ) , i then proceeded to slick my drive . remember , only 2 simple , benign and almost inconspicuous errors during the backup process . everything looked great . during the restore process , i then received numerous errors , each of them requiring me to click 'yes ' when asked if i wanted to proceed . i got tired of clicking yes around the 100 or so mark and decided to click no . when you click 'no ' , everything is undone ; there is no 'ignore all ' function so i had to sit through every prompt and got tired of it and decided that proceeding with 1000 files and answering yes would involve too much pain for me . i then selected a smaller group of files to have restored , only the 'my documents ' folder but ran into the same situation . eventually i ran a test on a small folder to have restored and still ran into the errors but pressed through . hardly any of the files were received error free and those that had issues were never restored . my guess is approximately 2/3 or 3/4 of my files were not restored and of course none that really mattered made it . i had the latest update applied to the program , so that should not be the cause . i would have done better to slick my entire hard drive without going through the backup process as i would have been at nearly the same place but without experiencing all the headaches , frustrations and an investment of hours , no days of my time . the program has been recently purchased by microsoft for inclusion in the vista os , i imagine . it will do well as a microsoft product , as it fails to deliver upon its promises
1	i have used ms works from about the time it was born , when it was quite primitive and sometimes unstable . but i have continued to use it , primarily for databases , because it has become progressively more stable and easy to use . these are not all small and simple databases -- many include several thousand items , each with 20 to 30 fields of data . it is easy to `` find '' single items or to assemble groups of items ( `` filter '' ) , and to print customized reports . so if you do n't need ( or want ) the super sophistication of access , i have found works to be a friendly and helpful -- and inexpensive -- alternative
1	at first i had some difficulty adjusting to the new interface . once i got used to it though i find it a lot more useful and comfortable to operate . it 's a great step forward in all senses for acrobat ! !
0	i was very disappointed with this program . but i was also thinking it would be more comprehensive and include more than just basic words and phrases . even so , the male and female guides in the program often pronounce the words slightly different which can be frustrating . i learned more icelandic ( along with correct pronounciations ) while in iceland than i did with this program . and besides , anyone under the age of 50 in iceland speaks english
1	my dad got this for me to supplement a latin textbook i have been studying for my high school language course . it is quick and easily understandable . you get plenty of words and phrases , which is perfect for a traveler . if you want to learn the language for the sake of knowing it , not travel , however , you 'd better get a book to supplement this . it does n't teach about pluralization , verb conjugation , or other oddities that the language holds , such as , in latin , the ending -m which implies a direct object . the latin cd also does not use the dashes over the vowels ( ie . , , , , ) . overall , i am very happy with the product and with the price of $ 39.99 ( usd ) , but i am also quite glad i have my textbook ( ecce romani ) to go with it
0	i 've been a digital artist for 5 years and always loved and supported paintshoppro and corel products . i have to say i am very disappointed in the new version , pspxi . no problems with the download , but the program crashes easily , you can not drag and drop as fast as in 9 , basically is slower in everything you do . i am a photographer , and looked forward to the new photo features , which work , but for panoramas and complicated work others than one photo forget it . just hangs up and so slow you could go have dinner in between . i have searched the net and support wise , the upgrades and patches have not helped . corel is not solving the problem and maybe they ca n't . this is not a pc problem which they so want us to believe . i have plenty of memory and speed on my pc . it may be something involving how the xi stores it 's cache . not sure . but the changes are not workable , sadly . i think there are some corrupt files or driver problems that corel desparately needs to fix and supply us with , or they will find themselves out of the ps market . this is not just me talking , it has happened to alot of loyal fans . because it could be the better than photoshop if they fix it . if you really want the program , download the free trial first and or try the x or 9 version , especially if your pc is an older model .
0	this is my first public review of any product . i generally dont have the time or motivation to go throught the process of posting a review . however , i have never had such a negative experience with a commercially available software package before . from beginning to end , the process of repeated attempts to install and then trying to remove nis2007 was time-consuming , frustrating , and crippled my computer . first the operating environment details . i 'm running xp-pro sp2 on a 2.6ghz pentium with 1gb of ram . upon the de-installation of the existing nis 2006 and spyware doctor applications , i proceeded with the installation of nis 2007 . the installation appeared to go cleanly , but upon attempting to restart , my computer hung on shutting down , and upon attempting to come up , i got a blank desktop with no task bar , start menu , or desktop icons . later , as i was working with symantec support and was able to get a desktop back , i also experienced things as not being able to bring up the control panel or click on the 'my computer ' icon . of course , i had no internet access during the whole ordeal . since i couldnt find any phone number contact in the ridiculously minimal instruction manual that came with the package , i called my local isp to find out what they knew about the affects of using nis 2007 . through them i got a phone number for symantec support . as a side note , the manual points out ways to get support if you have access to the internet and email , but gives no direction if you dont have access to those . over the course of the next 4 days of working through my issues with nis 2007 , my experience with symantec support left me with the impression that they were mostly incompetent and quite innefective . i give symantec credit for having 24/7 phone support , and i did work with one knowledgable support person there named jay , but most of the experience was frustrating and time-consuming . the help desk is located in india , and the first problem is that they couldnt hear me though i was speaking loudly . the next problem is that i had to answer the same questions repeatedly as if the person didnt understand my answers . on a number of ocassions , i felt the person on the other end was just going through a script , and wasnt listening to what i was saying or reading my growing case notes . i got passed around a lot to different people and spent a lot of time on hold . they kept trying to get me off the phone even though we hadnt worked through the problem completely . in one instance , the helpdesk person was trying to tell me that things were all fixed even when i had told her there was an activation error during the re-install we were working on . having worked with tech support and edited registries , and tinkered with start-up configurations and various services settings , i could never get nis 2007 to install ( tried four times ) . trying to un-install the package turned out to be almost as difficult and troublesome . uninstalling has left me with problems with my computer i have yet to work out . i still cant use my scanner because it complains about a symantec dll issue . i have no idea why that would be . anyway , i would rate this product less than zero if i could . there was nothing that went right , and a lot that went wrong . i cant believe symantec could put out such a pathetic piece of software with such inffective support . i 'm returning nis 2007 and trying my luck with zone alarm .
1	this is my second version/upgrade . it is very easy to use and i sought it out when upgrading my previous version . love it
0	this software did n't quite do what i expected . i was somewhat disappointed when i discovered that it would n't convert itunes m4p music files to mp3 files to run on a real player .
1	i tried an inexpensive program first and found it just did n't work . this program has been fantastic !
1	this thing is amazing.. my plasma is like a whole new tv.. my 60 '' sony sxrd paired with a ps3 is the best looking picture i have ever seen , after using the stv100 . this is a must have
0	in installed this product on a dell optiplex gx110 ( admittedly not the latest , but still a very standard machine ) running windows 2000 with 512mb of memory . in spite of spending literally hours with the software i was unable to get it to produce an outline or dimensioning of a wall being drawn by dragging the mouse , as clearly illustrated in the accompanying video . without this feature it is virtually impossible to efficienctly produce exterior or interior walls . multiple emails to broderbund have produced autoreplies suggesting that i refer to their website for help . this site is essentially worthless for all but the most fundamental problems ( like not being able to read the install cd ) . it would also appear that this product is picky about the hardware it supports and also the version of driver . be prepared for possible frustrations with this product , with little support from the manufacturer . i can not report on other features of the software because i was never able to produce even the walls of a structure
1	i remember the first time i used wordperfect , and the first time i used microsoft word . i could n't imagine why anyone would choose the vastly inferior word over wordperfect . years passed , and now i find myself using ms word every day . i 'd been ground down by the thousands of word users who 'd picked it up along with powerpoint and excel , and who did n't have enough savvy to know how to convert documents from one format to another . wordperfect _always_ converted msword docs . msword never reciprocated . should n't that have told them which program had a mandate to make the customer 's life that much easier ? with each successive iteration , wordperfect introduced some new innovation , and in the next incarnation , microsoft aped it . it got to the point where users would nod appreciatively at the innovation , then wait the inevitable year-long interval for microsoft to catch up , and then they 'd buy that . well , due to an outrageously fair price point and multiuser license , i tried wordperfect x3 , and it was like coming home . it 's nothing short of amazing . i went out and bought a copy for my parents , and they love it , too . now my brother , an attorney , has asked me to buy him a copy , since so many of the federal prosecutors he works with have wordperfect only , and ca n't seem to open his word files . the more things change , the more they stay the same
0	this program works after it 's installed , but the installation process is unbelievably flawed . if you have a version of norton on your computer already , this may cause all kinds of problems with the new installation . not only did i have to uninstall all versions ( after norton lets you install the new one ) , but i had to make a bunch of changes to windows , also . on top of that , while you 're struggling to install ( i got it on to one computer easily , a second with some difficulty , and the third ... well , it 's been several days of struggle ) , norton counts down the number of days in the subscription . so if you install on one computer today , and another two months later , then your subscription on all your machines still expires a year from now . i do n't see how symantec can put out a program that does n't allow you to upgrade easily ... after all these years , they ca n't fix this major bug ? that 's just pathetic
1	i bought this program for my 11 yr old granddaughter and she has very quickly learned the keyboard . i wanted her to learn the correct way to type before she developed bad hunt and peck habits . so much homework now requires typed reports . she had fun with it . it 's a great program !
1	this is probably one of the most outstanding and rewarding software programs that i can ever remember purchasing . i never learned how to type , so i reserved myself from many computer projects/reports , email responses and business related aspects due to this 'achilles heel ' . well , i researched this software and found that it has come a long way from earlier versions and decided it 's time to give it a try . i even bought a plantronics cs55 - usb wireless headset from the get go to give this software a real workout . let me tell you , my pessimism was definitely challenged because the software worked extremely good about 20 minutes after opening the box and browsing the tutorial . i was talking sentences and watched it appear on my monitor within seconds . i speeded up my speach as if talking in a normal conversation with someone and this software just kept spitting it on-screen . amazing ! ! ! ! do n't get me wrong . there are occasional misspellings to deal with but your user profile keeps getting updated everytime you use it and prevents the same mistakes from occuring the next time . it begins to gain more and more accuracy . salvation has been found as far as i 'm concerned . p.s . i began running the program with win xp - 512mb ram and it performed very well . i just upped to 2 gigs ram . most everyone in forums recommends at least 1 gig ram . i did this review in about 1 min . and had only two misspells .
0	if i could give less than 1 star for any trend micro product i would . it gives too many false positives when you do n't even have a virus . you are going nuts trying to find where the virus is and there is not even one there as trend told you there was . avoid this like the plague and save your hard earned money . it 's a piece of crap .
1	i bought this package because my daughter needed to be able to do word processing and make presentations for school . i used it because its what is being used at my office . i wish they had included frontpage instead of one note ( which i really have n't been able to find a use for ) . otherwise , it works the same as other ms office packages i 've used in the past
0	if you spend a good deal of your time doing ocr on books skip this program . it is even slower than the previous version ( which was tortoise-like ) still screws up the order of columns , is very bad at reading mixed numbers and letters , takes forever to move through long documents , and just genreally makes you feel like you are back to using a 486 when you are working on a pentium 4 . oh , and do n't be fooled by the claim that it can actually create fillable forms . it will take you less time to create it from scratch in word than to scan it in and then fix all the errors . i 'm switching to kurzweil
1	i own hallmark card studio 2006 , and this product is a different , interesting addition to greeting-card-making . it has lots of kinds of pictures , i.e. , aquatic mammals/fish , etc , for making `` fun '' children 's cards
1	i have been using omnipage for several years at my law office and found that the ocr with this version is impeccable . i frequently scan and ocr newspaper and magazine articles . they are multi-column and the magazine articles typically have graphics and tables or charts . when i convert them into word documents i seldom get any formating errors . in fact , because the ocr is so good i have set up a batch process to run at night to ocr all the day 's work so my computer resoiurces are n't being taxed when i am in the office working . way to go nuance
1	i have read several reviews and decided the spyder2pro would be a good monitor color calibrator for me . i have a samsung 970p monitor with all adjustments via software . the calibration process is very simple and all you have to do is follow the menu of questions during the calibration process . i like the spyder2pro and would recommend it highly .
0	i was thoroughly disappointed . the first few words i looked up in the thesaurus were not listed -- words like upholstery ! when i went online to see what i might be able to glean from their online site , first fogware had not sent me a coupon , then i had to deal with bad customer service ( i am not doing business with any companies anymore that give bad support ) then after i finally got the coupon code they had left out of my box , the online info is exactly what we have in the cd -- so save your money and do not subscribe to their extended services site unless you need a spanish online dictionary also ! very bad ! i am now going to go buy roget 's and check it out
1	the product is easy to use . like how it intergrates with ms office applications . it 's been a great tool for providing documents to my clients
0	i just purchased the top end dell dimension xps ( with the 10,000 rpm harddrive ) but i still have to allow about 10 seconds for the initial program startup , then it seems to hang for 15 to 20 seconds after that . i usually just go get a cup of coffee when i start act and when i come back we are ready to roll . i also reboot my system every time i close act . the system just seems to run better without any `` lingering '' remnants of the program in memory . whenever i delete a contact the program locks up . it has done this through several versions . i simply reboot , restart act and it works fine . at some point act changed the date on many ( hundreds ) of my activities to 11/18/2004 . now i manually type the date into the call , to do , meeting and note fields to avoid this problem in the future . i have been an act customer since the early dos days . i have a huge commitment to the program in that much of my important data is now stored here ( and some of it is nowhere else ) . it is so difficult to export `` all the data '' ( including notes , history , etc ) that i am basically trapped . my point is , a program like this is not one that you can easily bail out of like word or excel , which has some alternatives available which will read your current files . a lot of the act ! database is proprietary and while you can purchase a conversion program from a few vendors , it is not a cheap proposition to do so
0	after over a year and a half including renewing for updates i 've now discarded norton sw 2006. it was problamatic and a waste of money . it conflicts with partition magic another symantec product and will not work with many ms updates . my system is now operating trouble free since i 've uninstalled nsw . previously my computer was eratic and crashed frquently
0	i bought this product to assist in recovery , but i tried to recover a program and it would not work . does real well on a complete recovery but do not expect a partial . works well on recovery of my stuff
1	easy to install and navigate . automatic incremental backups are completed randomly . sometimes they work , other times they abort . ca n't determine why
0	summary : i wasted a lot of time trying to make this work , and i eventually went back to other products . in theory , integrating virus checker , firewall , spyware , and data backup into a unified suite ( like ms office with word , excel , powerpoint ) makes sense . however , this software package seems poorly made ; it did not work very well for me . hardware , os , primary software used : 1 . dell lattitude d620 laptop with 2gb ram , windows xp , ms office 2 . dell x1 laptop ( thin/lightweight ) with 2gb ram , windows xp , ms office 3 . dell dimension desktop with 4 gb ram , windows xp , children 's games prior virus/spyware products : lattitude x1 : norton dimension : freeware provided by our isp theory : since microsoft makes the os office applications that get infected with viruses , their product should be better integrated with the os . there will be synergy by integrating several related software applications . lesson : well , after a series of terrible experiences , i hope others will benefit from my wasted time : 1 . instead of loading most of the program from the cd downloading small updates , this seems to load only a small part of the program and downloads huge files . this made me feel that the product was shipped unfinished . you had to do this separately for each machine since it hides the downloaded files then deletes them prior to finishing the installation . this took a better part of an afternoon . 2 . i purchased a 3-pack license . installing and activating the software on the 2nd 3rd machines required a series of very annoying steps that involved logging into their website with broken links . it finally required a phone call . at least , the phone support experience was good . 3 . the product promises to minimize performance impact , and improve overall performance . on the lattitude dimension ( powerful machines ) , there was no difference in performance , but we could notice a slightly slower performance with the x1 . this was later verified when we uninstalled the ms windows onecare and replaced it with another product . 4 . the product has difficulty updating . it opens a small message box that asks you to click to update onecare , but that takes you to a webpage that only works about 1 in 4 times . 5 . except for the first time , data backup always has several errors that i have to manually fix . this has very rarely happened with other data backup software i 've used . 6 . some applications , the firewall asks everytime for permission to connect to the internet although the application is in the list to always allow this connection .
1	i use corel draw x3 everyday for designing logos signs for my sign company . i can start from scratch and produce professional designs in a minimum amount of time . this program offers a wide variety of editing tools , great import/exporting options , photo editing and tracing options . the more i use this program , the more impressed i get
1	( responding to joel g 's review below ) it 's unfortunate that your child was unable to enjoy didi ditto because of a technical problem you had with your computer . the majority of didi ditto players are running microsoft windows and enjoying this great educational software . if you send us an e-mail message at service @ kutoka.com , i am sure that someone from our technical support team will be able to help you resolve the issue you seem to have experienced with your computer display . also note that all activites can be unlocked in the activities menu by pressing the f6 key on your keyboard . a full list of the game 's keyboard shortcuts can be found in the user 's guide which is accessible from the start menu . hope this helps
0	i have gone through all the major revisions of paperport , and i dislike them all . the features have improved , but the program has become steadily more unreliable and bug-prone . it often crashes , which means i have to shut down the entire program when editing a document and restart , which apart from taking ages , loses all the changes i made . very frustrating . it has also become steadily slower as the version numbers have climbed - you just to sit around twiddling your thumbs waiting for it to load a document or advance a page on a scanned document , especially if it contains many pages . if you can find an alternative , do n't buy it - unfortunately for me , i can 's see any alternative if you want to manage scanned pdf files in a sophisticated way . incidentally , this product seems living proof of the dangers of bloatware - it 's pretty clear that the programmers have lost control of the software 's innnards . plus , by the way , support for this product is a scandal - $ 9.95 for each email sent ? unbelievable
1	product came in a timely manner and i love it . easy to use and fun too .
1	connecting the cables was so easy i was sure i must have missed something . recording the music is equally easy . removing the snap crackle and pop was a snap . my only confusion resulted in recording from 45rpms , i should have left them as stereo because it seems as though if you check off as mono , you can not remove the crackle and pop
0	we know strollers ! ! this is our 5th stroller over 4 kids . we decided to try a dually . pros : plenty of room for 2 children both about 25 pounds . `` cute '' cons : we 're reviewing what we consider to be an expensive stroller . in our opinion the added expense should n't equal just an extra seat , but better design and higher quality . 1 ) while the dimensions are listed in the description , the relative size to every day objects are not discussed . objects , like say , doors . this stroller wo n't fit through 90 % of the doors in the world . you basically had better only expect that it go through the front door of your house or plan on parking it in the garage next to your suburban . the doorway must be a 3'0 door ( 36 inches wide ) . that 's usually only your front door . forget about pushing into or out of any interior doorways which are generally much smaller . 2 ) the straps are awful . again , our 4th stroller . worse one of all . incredibly , incredibly difficult to use . i 'm actually flabergasted at how difficult the straps are . despite having tightened them up as tight as possible , the two year old was out in under 10 minutes ( once she decided to be out ) . 3 ) impossible to allow the children to sit up . again , adjusting the straps to the utmost , the angle of the backrest remains extremly steep . perhaps to counter balance the lack of effective straps ? 4 ) hand brake is setup for the left hand . appears to be reversible if you want to work on it . 5 ) hood can not be lowered to cover front of children . if say , you are walking into the sun ( morn or evening ) , the kids are completely exposed . conclusion : very frustrating buy . would n't recommend it at all
1	as a hobbyist woodworker who works primarily with hand tools , i 've had to learn how to put a razor edge on things like plane blades and chisels . while i 've managed to master that skill ( can shave hair off my arm with these tools ) , putting a sharp edge on my kitchen knives has been a nightmare . i 've tried numerous methods , none of which has worked well . about a year ago , i puchased the spyderco sharpening kit . read the manual , watched the dvd , put my kitchen knives to it , and ... ... ended up with pretty dull knives . frustrated , i put this kit in a kitchen drawer . fast-forward to last week . the kitchen knives are dull again , and none of my sharpening systems work on the knives . so , i pulled out the spyderco again and gave it another try . this time , i tried sharpening my serrated bread knife . after just a few strokes , it was good as new . so , i tried it on the straight knives again , but only got a modest increase in sharpness . now convinced that some of my kitchen knives are made from inferior stainless steel , i tried sharpening my swiss army knife . again , after a few stokes on the sharpmaker , i had a wicked sharp knife . i was down in the workshop today , sharping my plane blades and chisels . the last plane blade to sharpen was for a scrub plane ... the blade on these is very convex , so sharping it is always a challenge . fortunately , it does not need to be super sharp , and never has been . the sharpmaker was sitting out , so i said `` what the heck '' , and gave the scrub plane 's blade a few freehand strokes on the sharpmaker ... no sharpening jig to hold the blade like i normally use . for fun , i tried to shave hair off my arms ... .and it worked ! i could n't believe it ... this sharpmaker makes sharpening too easy ! it 's american-made , very well thought-out , and works amazingly well when your blades are n't made of junk steel . what more could you ask for ?
1	use the xl most every day and find that it does a fairly good job for what it is supposed to do . only use it about ten minents at a time since i am 72 i dont overdue it . can see the difference in my abdomen already
1	just the perfect cap ! . it fits like no other swimming cap . it wo n't pull you hair when removing it , neither will slip a bit from your head after swimming several laps or flip turning . very resistant material , and a great finish . awesome colors !
0	small ... very small kit , not as advertised . every item needs expensive batteries
1	its a good sword i put it through my room door no prob
1	these are exactly what they are advertised to be . i thoroughly enjoy using them
1	i looked at many different variations of swiss army knife before i decided on this one . i could n't be happier ! this has an excellent variety of tools for everyday jobs ( the screwdriver heads , the small blade , the scissors ) , and it 's great for outdoor use at picnics , camping , or canoeing ( the saw blade , the large knife , the toothpick ) . there are still a few tools i have n't used , but overall , this is one of the best mixes of tools for the money
1	great flooring system . easy to assemble and very strong . expensive but worth it
1	this has been used by our family forever ! we use it on burns , diaper rashes , cuts on our animals , and just about any type of open wound -- it works wonders ! plus , this trial-like size makes it perfect for the diaper bag , purse , drawer , or first aide kit
1	extra clips are neccessary ! the gun goes through ammo and the clip only holds about 45 rds
1	a friend who is a successful competition mountain bike rider asked me to weigh the blackburn airfix after i bought it . he has had many occasions where his chain has broken , or his tires have punctured , so he wanted to compare the weight of the blackburn versus the weight of all the individual tools he carried when he rides . the airfix weighed in at about 245 grams - about 8 ounces - and his tools , including inflator , tire levers , hex wrenches and chain tool ( all included in the airfix ) tipped the scales at 337 grams - about 11 ounces . i suppose that a multitool may not be as convenient to use as individual tools , but for handiness , this seems hard to beat . the blackburn lifetime/no-questions-asked guarantee is also very attractive . so while i have yet had to put this tool into action with either my trek 2200zr or my trek 6000 , in a world where every ounce of weight is a heavy concern , pardon the pun , i imagine i have made a wise purchase
0	maybe the s120 will work for you , but it was nothing but trouble for me . i bought it because of the great features and price , but returned it because of all the problems : 1 ) the manual is anything but friendly , e.g . after completing the 11 steps to set the date you are then told that there 's a short cut . thanks . 2 ) after spending much more than an hour with the manual just to get the basic settings in , i 'm off to exercise . great start , the reading is my usual pulse around 55 , then it drops out to 0 . ok , maybe the contacts are too dry , so i wet them . off i go again and the pulse rate measures 204 then to 0 . ok , maybe the chest strap is positioned poorly . different position , same result -- measured pulse rates all over the map . i decide to forget what the monitor records and finish my exercise . final result -- i got periods of reasonable heart rates , but lots of time the values were either 0 or over 190 . the next day i try again with the same result -- drop outs and then sky high readings . it went back later that day
0	the compass is wholly unreliable . the light button turns on in your bag , thus draining the battery . one of my worst amazon purchases
0	i bought this gloves so i would n't have to wrap my hands to protect my wrists everytime i went for a bag workout . one reviewer is clearly confused . they said that there was a metal bar in the glove to prevent fatigue in your hand . turns out there is no metal bar in it , but instead it was plastic or something similar . then when using these gloves on my 100 pound punching bag i wound up with blood blisters all over my knuckles . this has never happened to me before and i have been working out with punching bags for over 15 years . yeah sure you might get some skin torn off from your hands rubbing on the inside of the leather everlast gloves the first couple weeks you use them but blood blisters on your knuckles after your knuckles are use to those kinds of blows for years . another thing i noticed about these gloves is they wear out fast if you constantly use them on punching bags . they get to the point to where you feel like there is no padding in them . gave these gloves 2 stars since i liked the idea of being able to wrap these gloves on and go to work . but they need to be greatly improved upon .
1	we got this for our son . he loves it ! ! ! ca n't hardly reach the pedals but that dont stop him . stylish and well built , i think it should last a long time . great product , would recomend to anyone ! !
1	this is a great exercise ball . it is great in helping your body tone up by balancing yourself using the ball with various floor routines . let me tell you ! ! ! it is very hard to balance yourself on this ball and i can really feel my muscles working out . it helps strengthen your muscles and gives you better balance and flexibility . this is a great product ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	i ordered a wobble balance board from everyting fitness and it came from karate depot and does n't even look like the product i ordered . i only give 1 star , because i ca n't give zero starts
1	i go to anime expos alot . and to to be honest this sword aint half bad . unlike its 67 ' brother its only 37 ' but its a whole lot better to wield . combat ready , very sturdy and made in china . i notice some swords made in pakistan ! and they usually end up breaking so this swords worth the buy if your a bleach fan and if you wan na save some cash
0	the ski rack is attached to the thule bars by a plastic connector which must be spread almost to the breaking point to wrap around the bar . the old 724 had metal connectors . making them plastic is insane . these connectors will break over time . additionally , a thief could simple steal your skis by grabbing the rack and twisting it thereby breaking the plastic connectors .
0	i really wanted to like this lantern . it is a nice size and is nicely made at a great price , but the light output is pathetic . the package gives the impression that there are 4 leds in it , but i find that doubtful . the light output is no better than the output from a tiny key fob princeton tec or photon . in fact , i think you could read a map , or a book , play cards , or follow a trail , more easily with one of the tiny key fob lights . i 'm returning mine .
0	billy is great , full of energy and enthusiam . i get great results from his workout much better than any other instructor . my family get great results from his workout . his customer service rep were helpful . however , i strongly , strongly recommend ordering your taebo products through amazon . i 've been doing business with amazon many years and have placed over 150 orders . i never , never once had any problems with my orders at amazon . when i had questions , it 's amazing at not only how quick amazon will reply but will give a long thorough and kind explanation . because they reply within a day and take so much time with the response , it shows they truly care for you and want to give you the best service possible . i 've never found customer service of this very high and rare quality . in november of 2005 , after ordering the billy bands from the official billy bank 's website . i was sent a package , without my permission from the company that contained billy 's energy formula supplements . it was a 14 day delayed bill for 31.85 . i was upset this was sent without me knowing but here 's the worse part . i contacted customer service , a gentleman told me do n't worry you have n't been billed just send us back the package and we 'll credit you $ 5 into your account for the shipping , packaging , and mailing cost you pay out of your own pocket to have the items sent back . within a few days i send the product i never requested back . twice by phone and once by email from 3 different cust rep i was told i would receive a $ 5 credit to my bank account within 7 to 10 days . i was already upset about this matter but it was n't that big of a concern . however , about 2 weeks well over 10 days i never received the $ 5 credit to my account . but there was a charge taken from their company without my permisson or authorization from my own personal bank account for $ 8.97 . a few days later the $ 8.97 was put back into my account . when i contacted the company this is their reply : thank you for your recent e-mail . we apologize for the inconvenience . our records show that your vitamin shipment was on a 14 day delay billing cycle ( i sent the item i never wanted back in 7 days not over the 14 day limit ) . this means that when the charges actually went through , you were only charged for a small portion of the amount that showed on the invoice ( i kept the copy and nowhere on the invoice is this stated ) . you received a credit for the shipping and handling plus 5.00 dollars to ship it back too . this means , when the charge for the vitamins actually went through you were only charged for 8.97 . this is also the refund that you have received , the amount paid ( again since the item was sent back within 14 days i should n't have been charged and nowhere on the invoice is this stated that i would only be charged a small portion ) . so basically they sent me a product i never requested . told me they would give me some money to have the product sent back . took money from my bank account without me knowing and paid me back with my own money they stolen . to sum it up , do business with amazon !
1	the item is nice , but $ 15 for shipping on each blade is outrageous . i know that if you shipped two of them together , it would n't cost $ 15 for both of them , let alone separately . and everyone wonders why their items are so cheap..
0	i am surprised this bike has gotten good reviews ; i am quite diappointed . i purchased this bike after looking at many mountain bikes and decided that this seemed to be a good buy . however , it turned out not to be so . first of all , the bike is really ugly with its white and brownish colors , though i suppose that 's a personal issue . as for performance , this bike is not worth its stated price of over $ 200 , so do n't think you are getting some great deal . the suspension leaves something to be desired and it seems to be shifting funny . i am not an expert on bikes , but i 'm pretty sure shifting is supposed to be a little smoother than this . also , after about a week , i noticed a strange noise coming from the bike as i peddled . it 's hard to explain ... almost like something is out of place . so again , the bike is not worth this price . perhaps if it were being sold for around $ 100 it would be a decent deal
0	not what i expected . this bench is ok for a petite woman , not suitable for a man or anyone over 5 feet tall ...
1	this is the first product i 've ever bought to work out my forearm , so i ca n't compare it to anything else ... but i will say it does work . i 've noticed a strength increase in my forearm in just a month of using it . it 's comfortable and easy to use . i would like the highest resistance to be a little harder , though
0	despite charging the flashlight for the required 15 hours , the light failed to shine for more than 5 minutes . also during those lackluster minutes of operation , the emanating light seemed to be nowhere near the advertised 1 million candle power
1	i would just like to tell everyone who did n't understand the use of this item ... they are n't actually anti-gravity boots ! they are used for a type of exercise called inversion where you put the boots on and attatch them to a bar hanging either from a wall or cieling , so in other words , you hang upside down with these boots while attatched to a bar . they are in no way meant to make you float , or fly , or anything else that can only be found in sci-fi magazines..
0	when i purchased this item i got the impression that the kit ( looking at the picture ) included everything but the gazebo - which is the frame . you should be more specific and mention that the kit is just the screen around the frame and the top cover was not part of the kit . i need the top part of the gazebo more than the screen around it . the title of this item should say : `` gazebo screen '' and not `` gazebo screen kit '' ... unhappy custome
1	yes ... ... ... i like it , after using for 2 weeks , my fingers were strong . good thing is that this exercise helps in smooth blood flowing in your body
0	i bought a mesh chair that looked very similar to this and loved it , so i thought i might like the alps chair too . i was wrong . it 's very light weight , but it 's a lot longer than my other chairs , which made it more difficult to carry and transport . the arms are attached to the seat with cheap plastic fittings , one of which broke the first time i used the chair . the next day , three of the support bars broke completely apart at the rivet points , throwing me to the ground and rendering the chair completely useless . save your money on this one
0	had to return the first one due to non-functioning thermo and fault compass . small is nice for hanging it on keys or pack , but the same smallness makes it a little hard to opwerate one handed . i also have a brunton compass that fits the hajnd much nicer . we 'll see how long the 2nd one lasts
0	i ditto the previous reviewer ... i thought these seats were adjustable , was i wrong , there is only 1 position and that is practically laying down.. suck
1	my daughter is 2 1/2 years old , 32 lbs . and i wanted to get back into jogging . after reviewing many strollers i decided on this one for it 's price and features ( swivel front tire , rubber tires , tray for myself and my daughter-snacks and juice keep her from getting antsy on my runs ) . i was n't sure if she would be too big for a jogging stroller but she fits very comfortably in this one and has n't complained during any of my runs . it handles great too ! ! my only complaint is that i have not found it as easy as other reviews say it is to fold up . i have a suv so it has not been a problem , but i must say for me it does not fold flat at all and i am not sure it would fit into a trunk . but , most reviews have have said it folds easy . not sure what i am missing , but..
0	i would not recommend this product unless you absolutely can not afford to spend any more money . for around $ 60 , you could get the `` world industries m.a.d . balance board '' and get a much better looking and more durable product . or you could spend around $ 80 and get a bongo board . if you really want the best and have the money for it , you could spend about $ 120 and get an indo board . the zoomboard that i received was green and blue . unfortunately , it looks garish , but a child may like the look of this . in addition to the garish coloring scheme , the board has a rough sandy underside . this is good because it allows the board to better grip the rolling tube . however , after a couple weeks of using it ( five days each week for 30 minute sessions with my 140 lbs . frame ) , the tube develops craters from the sand and wears down . then again , if you wait it out , the sand eventually will slough off of the board itself and you wo n't have to worry about wearing down your rolling tube . but the gripping surface will be compromised . if you try using this on a hard floor and not carpeting , the rolling tube starts to move less fluidly than before . make sure there are no grains , pebbles , or hard materials on the surface you are practicing on because they can easily ruin your rolling tube . this may be a failing of boards that use a wood rolling tube . overall , this board is fun , but not great quality . if you absolutely can not afford $ 10 more to purchase a much better product , then buy this board and use it sparingly on a carpet to get a long life out of it . if you can afford more , keep looking and check out the products that i mentioned above and get something that 'll actually be worth your hard-earned money
1	the suunto bike pod is easy to install in a few minutes , and worked , as advertised , paired with the suunto t3 , training effects/heart rate monitor . unlike other wireless cycling computers used in the past , the suunto bike pod does not require micro positioning on the bike and continues to send reliable signals to the suunto t3 , even in bad weather and over rough terrain . although bike pod includes provisions for mounting the suunto t3 on the handle bars , this configuration is not required for use . the suunto t3 is a wrist-worn training effects and heart rate monitor , and works fine when worn on either the left or right wrist , receiving wireless signals from the bike pod as well as the suunto heart rate transmitter worn around the chest
0	this unit is amazingly heavy given that it is mostly mesh . the poles are not super high quality and i would imagine are going to break is used a lot . i used this in some high winds and the zippers broke .
1	this product is phenomenal . it reduces if not eliminates chaffing when applied properly . it worked under my wetsuit . it works under your arms and around your neck during open water swimming . it works between your thighs or on your chest when running . it may even prevent blistering on your toes while running , but i ca n't directly confirm that . i 'd recommend reapplying every four hours
1	i feel this product provides excellent value for the occasional biker or hiker . while cycling i had filled the hydration bladder with water and ice . i also carried a 32oz bottle of gatorade in the the storage area . there was still plenty of room for snacks , keys , clothes etc . i purchased a sony portable cd player/radio . it fits nicely in a special compartment with the headphone wires coming out of a slot in the top of the pack . my radio also has a remote which is great when you do n't want to stop . the chest and waist straps hold the pack comfortably yet snugly to your body so it is not bouncing around . the one negative that would report is the bladder hook . rhis is what the bladder suspends from inside the pack . i think it should have a latch or something to hold it more securely . what i found is that when you take it off , it may slip off and then it pinches the hose which prevents drinking . i try to keep the velcro that closes that part of the pack close to the hook . this seems to help . overall though i am very pleased with my purchase .
0	i paid [ ... ] bucks for tyhis gun got it and got it ready and figured out how it works and after using it a few time si relized its flaws first its too damn small its accurcy is not bad but its velocity is utter crap and doenst do squat in heavy battles and the clip is a reduiclus system of shaking the rounds form teh clips into the spring ssystem buy this for collections and maybe for soem fun but not a good gun and it jammed after the first month and i broke it trying to fix it
0	well , they looked so cool on tv that i ordered 2 of them and i regret it . it 's awkward to get the hook back into the `` rocket '' once the bait is on . i took my son fishing with them and what we ended up doing is not launching them out of the gun/rod . we left the pod open with the bait on the hook and dropped it into the water and let it drift with the current . i 've come to find that buying cheesey little rods and reels are simply a waste of money . if you 're going to take a little one out fishing , just use your own and let them reel yours in until their big enough to handle a decent set up . the only reason i gave this 2 stars is because it was a neat idea .

1	i 've had my 1 quart stanley thermos for over 20 years now , and this is by far , no doubt about it , the best thermos ever invented . i have poured hot coffee in this thermos in the morning prior to doing field work in the dead of winter in upstate ny . after leaving the thermos literally sitting in the snow in -20 degree temperatures all day , at 5 pm the coffee was still piping hot . if you need to keep liquids hot , this is the best non-electric product out there for doing it
1	i write very few reviews , but i just wanted to share my unbelievable success with healing my cracked heels . i have fought this battle many years , with no success . i started using this stuff 3 weeks ago , along with a heel sander , and i only have a small scar that i suspect will go away . i can not believe the results ! ! ! i only wish i had taken pictures to proof the results ! ! but who wants to look at ugly cracked heels ? ? ? lol ... it works ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	bought this for my son . he loved it and played with it a lot for about a week . then the wheels broke . he was n't doing anything unusual with the board just riding it back and forth on the driveway . the wheels seemed to warp and twist making them unstable
1	expensive , but i use it for aerobic and occasional high impact exercises as well as yoga . very satisfied
1	great product . i just received my ball today . i could n't wait to work out . if i learn how to stay on it that would be saying something ! i will always recommend max-fitness
0	like you ( i 'm sure ) i saw this machine on television ( mistake number one ) and then ordered it online without ever trying it first . this machine is a joke . if you can not get your legs over your head then maybe this machine is for you . but this is not for serious users who stretch everyday . i can do more with my $ 5 stretch band from target than i can with this big heavy space-taking piece of junk . the resistance is zero , and just laughable over all . save yourself the money , and frustration - buy a lightweight no-hassle stretch band !
0	i bought this knife for my husband for a christmas gift . at first he was thrilled to get a new one . upon putting the knife on his key ring and trying to use it , he noticed that the blade opens toward the key chain , making it almost impossible ( and very uncomfortable ) to use . he had to buy another knife that opened the opposite way . he did , however , like the other features , namely the light and the pen .
0	... and buy a gps instead . i agree with previous reviewer ( dave57 ) , i would never buy a suunto again . worst than dave , i simply got caught in heavy rain during a hike and my vector was full of water , could n't even tell the time . i send it to suunto finland for repair and they say that it leaked from the housing and `` kindly '' offered a repair for 140 euros .
1	perfect , exactly what i expected and wanted . i ride to work in rain or shine or storm and was sick of the water shooting up , had it on in less then 5 min . my bike is full suspension , 26 inch wheels with that horse shoe ( u ) bar on the lower legs of the front fork and it still fit with no problem . do n't know how it would handle a crash in trees though , sits high like a dirt bike look . people ask where i got it
0	very disappointed ... it didnt play any music its own quiet difficult to squeeze ... ..
1	i used mine for two weeks snorkeling in hawaii . it is n't perfect . it does take on a little bit of water sometimes when you go below the surface , but it is n't enough to cause any problems . it is pretty easy to clear by just giving a hard quick blow . you probably wo n't find anything better
1	i just love my little parrot ! the kids on the bike trail love to hear it too
0	first of all the colors of the product at amazon pictures and the real product doese n't match . what seens to be a silver watch it is realy a white one . at the beggining everything was ok , at the end of first week the light button locked ( after a few hours i get it unlocked ) , in the second week the the battery has ended . i 'm very disappointed..
0	i bought this compass at a good price , thats about all i can say good for this product . the backlight is too dim plus the compass will not hold an accurate reading , i have to keep resetting it . i can not reccommend product
1	very nice flooring for the price . easy to put together . i use it as weight room flooring in an exercise area i have set up in my garage . if you are looking for aerobic room flooring , i would recommend buying the 20mm version
0	i got this heart rate monitor and the strap was way too small so i had to order a replacement strap when i went to change the strap the battery was dead the battery lasted only 1 week . so i had to buy 2 new batteries one for the watch and one for the chest strap and now there is a line of pixels out on the screen of the watch . i am going to get a forerunner those seem allot better . i was very disappointed with this my suunto dive computer is great this hrm sucks .
1	it is a great football but is hard to grip if you do n't have real large hands and is slippery
0	basically the title says it all . i figured for a 100 dollars i would get a nice green and that the break would add to the challenge . basically this is a poorly made toy that should n't cost more than about 20 dollars much less a hundred . like i said in the title if you want an overpriced piece of junk then you hit the jackpot with the tru-break putt 'n hazard . the only thing this is a hazard to is your wallet
1	i live in san francisco and we bike everywhere so i 'd been trying to find a new bike trailer for my 2.5 yo daughter who outgrew her front mounted baby seat . everywhere i went the trailers were priced at $ 250 plus . i was a bit skeptical about buying this instep because it was a `` no name '' brand ( wrong - it turns out that its made by schwinn ) although it was priced at about half the price on others . when i research the product i found it to be lighter than the pricier brands . it runs smooth , easy to attach/detach . i keep the stroller front wheels always mounted so that i my daughter falls asleep and i wnt to walk around she 's can continue sleeping . i recently did grocery shopping with the trailer and my daughter . it has a rear compartment that fit 3 traderjoes paper shopping bags , an additional bag in the front with my daughter , and one more on the rear basket that is mounted on my bike . i 've also taken my daughter an another of her friends ( it sits two kids ) and they loved it . overall , a very good product - although not a sleek and cute as others like the burley - but its lighter , and priced much below comparable products
1	let me start by saying that i ordered this rowing machine on april 2 and it arrived on april 5 ! i was so excited ! even though it has poor instructions on putting this machine together , it is n't impossible . the tension strap is twisted around part of the machine that needs to be unwrapped first and that is not mentioned in the instructions . also , two of the steps seem to be out of order , but i still give this product a 5 star rating . when i was in college , i used a machine like this in their exercise room and loved it . this is just like it , but i think it 's even better . i do n't have a problem with the foot holders on this machine like i did with the one at college . the quality is great for the value . i feel that i have enough resistance and that i 'm getting the workout that i 'm looking for . i use an elliptical rider first , then i get on my rower . this is now rounding out my workout and i love it ! my elliptical rider is a gym quality machine and was very expensive but worth the cost . this rower is inexpensive , but does n't feel like a cheap machine . again , i am thrilled with it . by the way , i do n't think that you can tell it in the picture , but the fan cover has holes all the way around it . when i 'm working out i can feel the breeze that it is generating . it does n't blow me away , but it 's enough to cool me off some . i hope you find the machine you 're looking for . if you 're looking to save some money and get a great workout , this may be the rower for you .
1	i purchase my total gym and though it did not give me the workout that i expected , it did help me to get firmer and leaner in a short period of time . i wish it offered more of a workout for the legs but overall , i am very happy with my gym and i use it all the time . only a 20 minute workout 3 times a week made a huge difference in the way i look
1	the bands were sent in a timely fashion and were exactly as advertised . great folks to work with . now if they could sell me some motivation to use them daily ... i 'd sure buy that too
0	i had purchased a rifle from airslat and it broke after 3 minutes of use . the quality was not good , but , the customer service of this company is the worst i have ever dealt with . it has been 2 weeks and no replacement has been shipped . i have had every excuse imaginable , first they wanted me to pay for shipping , then they wanted me to pay full price for another gun , then they said they did not have that model any longer and i would have to pay for the higher priced model . i still have not been refunded or had the item replaced . i have spent hours trying to get this taken care of with no progress . the worst customer service of all time !
1	i bought this bike for myself and i love it . i got it for half the listed price . it was originally intended as a starter to introduce myself back in to biking ( at 30+yrs old ) but i 'm going to stick with it . the other buyer with the bad experience must have gotten a bad bike . the brakes are excellent and the bike itself , including shocks , are just as sturdy as my husband 's expensive pro bike . the 24inch is perfect for me , being barely five-foot-two ; and does n't seem too juvenile in stature or in color . i highly recommend this bike
1	i did n't know what to expect , but these turned out to be very good quality . they stretch well and return to shape . they do n't feel like they are going to snap apart when you are in the middle of exercising . i was very pleased with the product . be careful , though , if you have a latex allergy . i also got excellent service from the company ! i would definitely do business with them again
1	this little device is easy to put together and easy to use . not for 'intensive ' workouts however , you can pretty much use it anyplace you 're sitting down . that could mean even while the tv is on ! like all exercise equipment , if you do n't use it you lose it
0	good points of the el-300 : powerful sharp beam ; long run per battery change ; easy on-off quick-mount clamp for anti-theft ; and , it 's a superb flashlight . i like to use it for undersink and underhood repairs , so i often borrow it from my bike . this light is intense enough to force a person to avert eyes , if the beam hits direct from even , say 40 away . cateye does caution us not to play the beam on people 's eyes . in my estimate , it is mostly a terrific flashlight , and not a great bike-mounted headlight , at least as a stand-alone . trouble is , that sharp-focused narrow beam makes you choose between two conflicting and shifting essentials : lighting your path ( you actually can with this focused power ) ; or alerting others to your presence . that would mean focusing it more toward oncoming traffic , or a tad right or left , toward peripheral traffic , depending where you are , and how the road tracks , and where cars are coming from . it 's a real attention-getter to oncoming drivers , which is great , if conditions are all just right : if you focus the lamp near level , and if the drivers are considerate enough to all approach from in front of your beam . however , traffic off to the side is another deal , since the headlight 's peripheral light suffers by contrast . i nearly took a short trip to a long rest , as a result . late on a quiet night , one flaky guy entering a major , broad secondary road i was traveling was coming fast up to his stop-sign , on a side street to my right , ahead of where i had just rounded a curve . he had a view accross broad lawns , on up the dark road behind me . after slowing just a bit , he accelerated and ran his stop sign . i was right near his position on his side-street , `` committed , '' pedaling about 15 - 17 mph , about to cross his bow . he started his right turn , gunning it , merging with unseen me . he was totally unaware of me , and was clearly of this mindset : `` no double-car-headlights , no car noise , so no car , so nuttin ' coming , so , good-to-go , so -- gun it ! '' ... all in the space of a couple seconds . moving fast , with the right-of-way , i had the el-300 blazing away bright . only , it was focused straight ahead of me , and a tad downward toward the road surface yards in front . i was dependent on the el-300 , to send ahead to the likes of him , unavoidable announcing light . it 's what i paid for ( about $ 45.00 delivered ) . i also wore a white helmet , had reflective stripes on my panniers and rack trunk , and the churning reflectors on wheels and pedals . but i know darn well all the reflectors in the world have no merit , when not bathed by headlights , and if not also bouncing back at a narrow angle to the driver 's eyes . that 's why i own a headlight . it 's why now-enlightened nj demands a bike headlight . of course , neither does a driver have any merit , when s/he rewrites the stopsign law to read `` no need to stop as long as i do n't see anyone coming . '' he nearly killed me , coming fast at me , broadside . he had regained nearly 15 or more mph as he started his right turn , still accelerating , when he spotted me and panic-braked . we were at one point about 2 feet apart , thanks to his hard braking , and my veering left on the ( luckily deserted ) dark main road . i was , for a fraction of a second , looking down at his headlights and bumper almost below me . could have reached over and touched his hood ornament . incredible experience . it was my closest call ever , and scared the hell out of me . it must 've scared the hell out of him , too . he registered his shock-and-awe with a reproaching after-fact horn blast , as he scrambled around and passed me , racing off before i could read his plate . i guess it must 've ticked him off , my scaring him with that close call . one little vehicular manslaughter can change your address awhile . equally maddening for him , after he passed the intruding cyclist with the red blinkie taillight , and the white helmet , and all the reflectors ( those alerted him , once i was his front-and-center target ) , he would had to then see that blazing headlight 's pencil-beam in his rear-view mirror . damn , nuttin ' he could blame on this creep on the bike . : - [ the el-300 simply failed me that time , as i see it , by focusing most of its light in a narrow , long-projecting beam . it was focused left of where he was looking , when i was very close to the side street he was traveling , ignoring his stop-sign . there should , from so much light energy , be some part diverted wider , closer to the bike , even if lower intensity . in my judgement there are two related design flaws with this lamp : 1 . the narrow focused beam , making you `` live ( ? ? ) with '' the single direction in which you aim the beam . its relatively dim peripheral light gets lost in any ambient light . 2 . that is in turn aggravated by its wandering from the aiming you settle on , both vertically and horizontally . the vertical part is the worse ; the mounting clamp sets too far back from the headlight 's balance-point , so it 's a seesaw that 's forward-heavy . lift your bike front , tap it down lightly , and you 've likely refocused the lamp lower , as you would not if the mounting were at the balance-point . aim it temporarily right ( and tight ) , and you are seemingly good to go ... but only as far as the first noticeable bump . it then drops a few degrees , and you keep correcting it vertically , to light either your intended path , or the oncoming drivers ' windshields . your need is like being at the oscars : you want to both see , and be seen , only in this case to save your life . i am chasing after another led lamp now , which i understand to have a wider ( along with brighter ) beam . i have respect for cateye in general . their current website page of battery-op headlamps does not offer the el-300 .
1	as an intermediate player , i have been highly satisfied with this racquet
0	small print on box : charging the spotlight takes approximately 15 hours using the ac charger adapter , and approximately 12-20 hours using the 12v car adapter . the spotlight/lantern can not be used while charging . a full charge will provide for approximately 30 minutes of power . 30 minutes after charging for 15 hours ? what the heck is the point of this flashlight
0	i have an original thighmaster i purchased years ago ... thinking this thighmaster gold was going to be similar i purchased it to take to work with me . it is very flimsy-it seems to be made of very light weight material that is not going to hold up . my old thighmaster is very sturdy-i have been using it for years and it looks fairly new . this one will be ready for the trash can in less than a year . save your money

0	i bought the cycleops wind indoor trainer to train at home when i ca n't hit the road because of work ( or weather ) complications . if you are like me that means weekdays late at night , or very early in the morning . i 'm terribly frustrated because i ca n't use it due to the unbearable noise the fan flywheel makes . my neighbors ca n't stand it . hey , i ca n't stand it ! the noise level is comparable to an industrial vacuum cleaner . to give you an idea , i do n't even hear the music from my ipod while riding this thing . do n't buy it ! go for the magnetic resistance models .
1	with a job that is extremely sedentary , 3 days sitting all day at a desk , 2 days putting on 220 miles or more sitting in a car , this has been a most welcome purchase . 5 to 10 minutes on this each day , has greatly relieved my low back discomfort to the point where i 'm able to continue this heavy work schedule , in relative comfort . if compressed discs are your problem , you 've got to try this , after first checking with your physician

0	i bought the armor abs because my gym membership just ended at my college . so i wanted to get a few small workout machines for home . the day i got it , one of the rubber bands popped of its holder already . the machine is designed very poorly , although what can you expect for the price . i 've had to reattach the bands at least 15 times over the past week , and today one of the rubber band holders snapped in half , leaveing that resistance level useless : - ( . overall though , i have to say , i really love this thing . if it wasnt for the d*mn bands flyin off all the time , it would be a great peice of equipment . if you use it carefully and correctly , you may be able to avoid these problems though . i give it a two because i love the machine , but i hate its bad habits ...
1	i was looking at the bigger cargo boxes but everything seems so big and heavy . i need a cargo box that i can put up alone on top the acura mdx-just the right size . the box was easy to assemble - less than an hour . it is also easy to attach to the vehicle . the box looks like the more expensive boxes on top of my vehicle and color matches well with my silver mdx . i just wish the plastic was a little thicker but i think it will hold up well . the box is sturdy after assembling i
0	i 've been looking for weight lifting gloves , and trying out gloves that seemed to work for me but either bled onto my hands or ripped . these gloves , however , dried out my hands and made me use lots of moisturizers . they also tore down the knuckles on my left hand and in between the thumbs . weighlifting gloves are yes supposed to keep your hands dry during work outs and to prevent calases . these gloves dried out my hands completely and gave me calases . if you want a good pair of gloves do not get these
0	i thought this was great at first until i realized that it works sporadically . i can get up in the morning and walk all over the house , look down and check my sportline to find it is still registered at 0 steps . other times i can walk a mile or more and find it recorded maybe 20 steps . one of the problems with it is its shape . unlike some pedometers ( like omron ) that are a vertical oval-shape , the sportline is a horizontal rectangle , which makes it easily roll with the waistline of your pants or skirt . it 's important for a pedometer to be perpendicular to the ground for it to record accurately . after much frustration , i finally bought an omron pedometer which i love . unfortunately , this sportline model is so inconsistent and inaccurate as to be useless .
0	let me first say that i did not purchase this mini stepper through amazon , but rather directly from the discovery channel store . two weeks after i submitted my review of their product on their web site , however , they still have not seen fit to post it . i used the discovery electronic mini stepper daily for 29 days ( 30 minutes per day ) before the cable around the pulley-wheel broke . this seems to be a consistent problem with this piece of equipment , judging by previous reviews on the dcs ( discover channel store ) web site . being inside the 30 day return window , i sent my stepper back for a refund . customer service , i must say , was excellent ... only the product itself was cheap and substandard . on a related note , this is the third mini stepper ( various brands , not all dcs ) i have owned in the past year . they have all broken down in one way or another . feel free to look at some of my previous reviews here to get the details , but the bottom line is that this will be my last mini stepper . take some advice from me when i say that these machines are built for people who are beginners in the world of fitness . that is to say , if you intend to use a mini stepper two or three days per week for 15-20 minutes , then you may be satisfied with one . however , if you are at an advanced or even intermediate stage in your workout routine , then do n't even consider one of these machines - you will destroy it , trust me . there 's just too much that can go wrong -- pulleys cracking , pulley cables breaking , shocks leaking ... and i actually broke the frame of one stepper . through all of this , i have learned one important lesson about exercise : keep it simple . i am now having great success with some simple resistance bands ( many varieties are available here at amazon ) and cardiovascular exercises ( e.g . regular old jumping-jacks ) . i get a better workout than any i ever got from a mini stepper , and i 'm feeling great and even lost a little weight in the right places : - ) honestly , if you want to save yourself some grief , please learn from my experiences and avoid the horrible cycle of mini stepper destruction . just buy yourself some resistance bands , maybe a jump rope , an exercise mat , an instructional video/book , and then get to work . exercising to tone your body and lose weight is n't easy ( and if it is , then you 're probably not doing it right ) , but you can make it easier by not wasting your time and money on junk like this
1	i have owned this bag for a few years and have found it to be an excellent bag for the gym . my size ten running shoes fit fine and it is easy to store behind my seat in my car . i am not sure if someone with a large shoe size ... say 13 and above may have some trouble or high top shoes ( basketball shoes ) may find the bag a tight squeeze . overall very satisfied
1	very well made product ; easy assembly and mounting . the no wobble feature is excellent . highly recommend this product
0	i bought this for my four year old for christmas . the net was broken on the second use when my four year old lightly banged it on our car bumper . a week later , his friend , also four , broke one of the sticks when taking a shot with the feather-weight plastic puck that comes with the set . do n't waste your money . even for little kids it 's probably worth it to just go ahead and buy real equipment that will last .
0	this is the biggest joke on the planet . no doubt , it is scary , but c'mon people . i guess it 's to scare the sh*t out of you . my comment has to be the first serious review that has been made for this item . think about it . . . the toilet . one of the best places for germs . and you want to attach some rubber device to it . i 'll do you one better , and you 'll get just as good a laugh from it . ( also , it 'll be a lot cheaper ) go buy a roll of saran-wrap . cling it tightly to the top of the toilet bowl . wait and watch as your guest visit the bathroom to use it . i do n't think no one will die from this type of trick

0	i wanted a bike to ride around on unpaved trails on my few acres in the country . this retro designed , one speed , steel framed , coaster braked , comfort bike seemed to be the ideal choice . when it arrived , i pulled out the tool box and set to work assembling it . the first frustration was that the instructions for assembling this bike are not included in the manual ( which seems to cover every bike but this one ) . how hard could it be to write up instructions ( with tool specifications ) for each model they manufacture ? a one page flyer could have done the trick . to further complicate matters , some of the models in the manual are assembled using metric tools and others call for standard sizes . it turned out that i could n't complete the assembly , because i could n't find a tool to handle the quick release hardware for the seat attachment . i had to take the bike to a bike shop to complete the assembly . even the bike shop had problems with this bike , because there is so little clearance between the fenders and the tires . i watched while they had to bend the sides of the back fender out by hand , so that it would n't rub the tire . when i got the bike home , the first thing that i did was to adjust the seat to the correct height , and take it out for a ride . within 10 seconds the seat slipped all the way down . the quick release handle ca n't hold the seat in place with the weight of a rider on it ( i 'm not that heavy ) . chrysler should have taken the retro design a step farther on this , and drilled holes in the seat stem for a rod insert to adjust the seat height . rather than try to dis- assemble this and box it up to return it ... i will check to see if i can drill the seat stem myself to get the seat secured at a ridable height . its too bad they could n't come up with a workable design for such an essential part of the bike as the seat height adjustment ! the points i do give here are for the otherwise sturdy frame , and tires that will work well for unpaved trails ... when i can finally ride this .
0	do n't waste your money unless your workout is sitting on the couch . this monitor is sold as `` providing unobtrusive reading of your heart rate during your workout '' . since you have to stand still to get an accurate reading one has to wonder what type of workout reebok did to substantiate this claim . get a strapped monitor for working out . while this is a great idea the design does n't match the intended purpose

1	this was a gamble since it is n't cheap and the results promised are no different from any other supplement ad campaign . i only tried muscle milk because i read up on it after seeing it endorsed by an nfl athelete during an espn interview . i started using it about 2 months ago and have been consistant with the servings daily . two months later my strength has increased , my mass has increased and my body fat has noticeably diminished . my workout routine and diet was always the same before starting on mm but the results since using mm have made an impact , there is nothing else i can attribute it to . the fact that it also tastes great is a nice bonus but given the definite results of mm i would still use it if it tastes like battery acid . do not fool yourself , it is loaded with fat . it relies on you to workout steadily and maintian a clean diet for you to realize it 's true benefit . you will not get sculpted by using mm without commitment , you will only get fatter . but if you are committed and use mm as suggested it will most certainly produce a change in your appearance .
0	i was promised 1-2 day shipping and did n't get it . i was promised reciept by dec. 6th and have n't gotten it

1	i 've had this bike for about a month now and it runs smoothly , went together fairly easy , and best of all its quiet ! something i seriously appreciate in exercise equipment is when i can actually hear the television over the machine . the complaints about the box falling apart during shipping is legitimate . the bike i received had a cracked cover because of the dent in the box ( arrived when i was at work or i 'd have sent it back ) . when i called for service i was greeted promptly , promised a replacement cover , and told that although they were instructed to tell me ten days they 'd bet more like 3-5 . they even suggested that i consider where i was in the setup before i assembled the bike and whether or not i 'd want to take it apart to put the new part in . very positive experience ... now if i could just get myself to spend more time on it

0	this stand is very bad quality . not worth investing in this stand . the speed bag platform isnt even made out of real wood . it vibrates too much ! the swivel it comes with is made out of plastic ! it sucks ! invest in a better stand like the ones from www.balazsboxing.co
0	well , i got through about a clip and a half before it started breaking . first it went from semi-auto to uncontrolled auto , then it just stopped working . it was pretty cool for a bit , and is pretty light and easy to set up , but i 'd suggest looking somewhere else for a pistol
1	i bought one of these , based from a review . i pretty much agree with her , the machine is great and it gives a good workout . but she forgot to mention , the thing can cause your feet to get sore ! i tried wearing high quality running shoes and it still hurt . i received an advice to attatch foam strips to the runners that you stand on , and that has solved the problem ! so far , i have not used the pistons , so it 's just a cardio workout . i have tony 's tapes he sells on his website and his music cd 's , and i do get a very good workout ! i have lost 13 pounds so far by using it , and i noticed it defanitely toned up the buns
1	this is the best , jansport has always made an outstanding product . this is the third one i have owned . plenty of room and just right size
0	this is my third heart rate monitor . i purchased this one because the battery died in my last hr watch . i thought i could replace the battery , but when i tried to replace it , i broke it . oh well . . . anyway , i purchased the reebok fitness hr watch because it was on sale ( 50 % off retail ) . i could n't find any reviews on it so i `` rolled the dice . '' with my two previous hr watches , it was pretty intuitive as to how to set and operate them without reading the instructions . with the reebok hr watch , i had to read the instructions a couple of times . after a couple of training sessions , i began to feel comfortable on how to operate it and use its settings . there are a few pros on the reebok hr watch : ( 1 ) the chest heart rate strap will work with precor cardio machines with heart rate monitors . ( 2 ) the chest heart rate strap 's battery is easily replaced . ( i do n't know about the watch . ) ( 3 ) it has a lot of features that you 'll find in higher priced hr watches . now , the cons : ( 1 ) the heart rate reading is much too small if you 're near-sighted or need reading glasses . ( 2 ) the shape of the crystal cover causes a glare under certain indoor and outdoor lighting so it 's difficult to read the small heart rate reading . in conclusion , because the heart rate reading is too small and there 's a glare , i ca n't read the watch unless i slow down , steady my arm , and position my arm at a certain angle to deflect the glare . because of this , i 'm disappointed with this watch . if you 've got good eyesight , you can add 1-star
0	this gun is horrible . i bought this for my friend and let me tell you it was a waste of $ $ $ . first off it is a 3/4 scale gun so it is very small and very light , if you were to drop it it would deffinitly shatter . also the cocking system is terrible on the top there is a lever you have to pull and if pulled in the wrong spot it will snap off and then it would be useless . when we did end up shooting it the bbs wentd straight for about 5 or 10 ft then curve down , so unless you are going get within five ft of a person it is useless , even if you do get that close he wont even jump the fps is more like 270 not 370 . also the clip is an absolute pain to load first you pour all the bbs into a chamber , then you pull down a spring and shake it upsidedown fot the bbs to gome onto the front chambet then you have to release the spring and put the clip in the gun . after about 10-15 shots you have to take the clip out and repeat the process . granted it holds 180 or so bbs you can only shoot about 15 at a time . over all this gun stinks . i bought it when it was originaly 100.00 but the list price was 10.00 so i thought it was going to be decent , but i was wrong . spend your money elsewhere ! ! ! ! !

0	**********update - the old review ( see below ) was for dixiekip . the only reason it 's still two stars is because i ca n't figure out how to change it . old vegas chips has been nothing but helpful in this matter even though i did n't actually order the cards from them . i would order from them any day of the week now just based on their customer service in an issue that was n't even theirs . my apologies to old vegas chips in this matter . i highly recommend them and if anyone knows how to change the stars , please let me know . if you are interested in these cards , go with old vegas chips , not some other dealer ! ! ! ! - jim ****************** i ordered these particular plastic cards because in my opinion , they are much cooler than the paisley ones that are also offered . i immediately ordered them , yet when my package arrived yesterday ( in a timely manner , i will give them that ) i opened to find the ugly paisley cards looking me in the face . i have not yet contacted the seller to see what options i have , but this is going to leave me either two options , 1 ) return them and wait longer for them or 2 ) suck it up and get stuck with the ugly cards . i will repost once i have spoken to them
1	first off , those of you calling it a `` clip '' should know that a clip is a nonremovable ammunition storage device attatched to or built into the gun itself . please call it a magazine ( actual name for it ) and a full metal jacket isnt a full magazine of amunition its a bullet with a full metal casing like say 30-06 round . second , dont complain about the scope because it is a decorative instrument . you can buy better scopes if your hardcore but if you are hardcore then get a real gun . this gun is good for shooting your little cousin from far away . its a great gun dont get me wrong but its not meant to be used and abused like a ww2 garand or bar . it 's plastic , it shoots things . i 'm probably reinstating most of what everyone else said but thats just one more reassurance . so yeah get this gun if airsoft is a hobby for you . not a sport . i also suggest getting .20g bbs and maybe a speedloader or 2 cause mags are so expensive and this gun pours ammo like water . have fun . p.s . though they may noth have the trigger finger ability , spring airsoft guns have a tendency to be more accurate and fire harder with heavier bb 's . if you are playin with friends i suggest getting a $ 30 dollar rifle with 250-300 fps ( shoots like 300-350
0	my first pedometer from sportline worked only a few days ( digital display completely disappeared ) , so i returned it to them , and after over two months and several emails from me to them , they replaced it with this sportline 350 . the first two days , it worked fine , although it seemed to count many more steps than it should have . the third day , in the middle of the day it said approx . 3400 steps , later that afternoon it said 1300 steps , and by nighttime the display totally disappeared , and never came back . i just sent the second one back , and am expecting that again it will take several weeks and multiple emails to get the situation resolved with their slow customer service . their products seem to be very poorly made , and i do n't expect to purchase any more ... . after reading the reviews , i have just purchased an omron , and am hoping it will be much more reliable
1	one thing i really like is that there was no plastic or rubber taste on the first use . it holds enough for long bike ride and was cold all the way to the end of the ride . it feels good on your back too . it helps in this florida heat . cons : the mouth piece is hard to hold onto because of the 180 degree angle . it would be easier to have a t mouth piece . i will be looking for a replacement .
1	we have used more expensive `` professional '' grade ergometers that would have cost at least three times as much and we are very pleased with how the integrity compares for a home version . assembly and operation are easy , the equipment seems well built and the noisy breeze generated by the wind resistance wheel is very tolerable , allowing conversation or tv viewing with only moderate volume increases
0	initially , the 340 was way too sensitive to be even remotely accurate . it did , however , give my wife a good laugh ; she was sure that at least 5000 of my 10000 'steps ' were registered while sitting perfectly still and clicking the tv remote . but after one week of use , the darn thing became so *in*sensitive that it would only register when i jumped up and down like a pogo stick . pass on this one
1	this has been a great addition to my truck - a useful compass and outside thermometer without going to the expense of a navigation system ( and without having to learn another techno-gadget ) . my only complaint is that the display illumination could be a bit brighter . i realize that a bright light on the dashboard could impair one 's night vision , but a bit more contrast on the display would be helpful at night .
0	it holds my bike but seems unstable - i still ca n't figure out where all 6 straps go on my car , and the support rails tilt downward towards the rear instead of upwards . plus , probably the biggest concern - there is no means of strapping the bike to the rack ( user must tie the bike down every time ) . my bike has n't fallen off though..
0	my daughter is 38 '' and about 30lbs . it 's the perfect size for her . we mainly use it as something to lay on while watching tv or reading books on the floor . pros - when in the `` chair position '' , it 's tall enough to accommodate taller children . - cover is removeable and washable - comes with handy pink storage bag ( although it 's kinda hard to fit the pump in the bag along with the bed ) - pretty easy to convert into chair ( there are 2 straps on each side of the bed that need to be `` connected '' in order to change it into chair - they are color coded ) . might be hard for young children to figure out how to do it . - inside of sleep bag is made of soft material ( although it appears as though it may snag easily ) . - large zipper located on one side of the sleep bag . easy for small hands to use . - weight limit : 100 lbs cons - the pump is very cheaply made and it takes a long time to inflate the bed ( it operates by use of foot motion or you can use your hands ) . - the air slowly leaks out of the bed . we actually thought ours had a hole in it when purchased , so we exchanged for another one . but this one too deflates pretty quickly . example : if we completely inflate at 7pm , by 8am the next morning it needs to be inflated again because it loses about 40 % of it 's air . - adult help is needed to change into chair . - adult help is needed to inflate . overall : it 's a bit pricey for the quality i was expecting . it would be nice if adult assistance was n't needed to change from bed to chair and back . defitely would work as an extra sleeping spot for the night , but it takes along time to inflate and requires an adult to do so
1	i purchased this bench about a year ago . i received it in 4 business days which i thought was really good . it took me about 45 minutes to put it together , there is alot of nuts and bolts , but once i finished assembly it has been a good machine , and i am still using it to do my weight lifting routines twice a week , it offers alot of different exercises , what i really love about it is the lat tower which alot of benches do not have until you get into the $ 300- $ 400.00 dollar range , which i was not willing to spend that much at the time . for the price of 129 bucks and the options you get , just can beat it . i am very happy with this machine . this machine is made by impex fitness and i definitely plan on upgrading to another impex when im ready . chris- v
0	ninety dollars for this is unbelievable . for less than $ 15 ( that is less than one sixth the advertised price ) someone with no skill could make an equivalent product from pine 4x4s and 1x12s in 30 minutes or less . it may not be `` cool '' , but it 'll get the job done . are you more interested in getting fit or having cool , trendy , and frivolous toys ? avoid this plastic albatross . it will be destined for a garage sale near you within two years . go to your local hardware store , spend half an hour and $ 20 ( and maybe learn how to work with your hands a bit ) and get what you need without supporting this craziness ... or -- just go for a walk for free . save your hard-earned money

0	i bought this toy for my 9 month old son for christmas . he loved it and it is a wonderful toy . however , in mid january it started to sound as if the batteries were dying and then it just quit . i replaced the batteries but to my disappointment it still would n't work . i tried different batteries again just to be sure and still nothing . i had a very hard time finding out how to contact imaginarium.com and finally just emailed amazon . they responded quickly and it appears that i will be able to return the toy and my son liked it enough that i may take my chances and buy it again . there are mixed reviews some saying that it is durable and works great and a few like mine
1	we bought this for my son when he was about 2 months old . he would just lay in it and would be entertained for a long time , which bought me time to do housework around him , etc . you can take the hanging pieces down and hang up other objects so that there 's always variety . i 'd say he lost interest in it though at about 7 months when he learned to crawl . i bought mine used on ebay and it was worth the $ 35 i spent . i would n't spend much more than that .
1	this is a nice sword for $ 35 ( plus tax ) . when i removed the sheath , there was some sort of goo on the blade ( probaby so it would n't rust ) . this is a carbon blade , so do n't leave it in a moist closet for 1 or 5,376 years ( by then the rusted blade alone will be worth a fortune ) . just dont get the blade wet , ok. you can rub a moist towel across it to get rid of the rust protector if you 're going to use it often but that is pretty much all you can do to clean it without a special kit . please dont brandish this sword around like a bad actor in a kung-fu movie . you could realy hurt someone with the point of the blade . i think this is shipped over seas , so dont challenge your friend to a violent battle the day after you buy this and you should be fine . blue dragon is actualy a japanese video game that no one bought . i think it was based on a part of final fantasy 2 . i do n't want to bore you with video games , so i 'll get to the point . put it on display , dont cut your lawn with it , dont play ninja with it , and dont ever ever ever ever ever ever try to cut a solid object in half with it ( prefrebly a tin can ) because the cheap blade could fly off the tang and hurt you ( or prefrebly your neibor ) in the face . please do n't throw the blade at your neibor either . p.s . i am not neil meislin , i am his son , daniel meislin . if you ca n't understand my numerous perenthesis , i guess you 're not smarter than a 5th grader .
0	the plug that keeps the air in kept popping out . we took it back and bought another one . same problem . so we took it back again . i think we spent more on gas going back and forth than we did on the float . buy one of better quality
0	i purchased the ab lounge 2 online , but returned it the same day . it 's too bulky heavy . i wanted it for my bedroom to use in the mornings while watching the news , but it 's too heavy to move around , and it does not fold . i put it together in my living room , and then tried to get it into my bedroom but it would n't fit through the door . i had to un-screw the bars , fold pull it through the door . if i had put the ab lounge 2 downstairs , then i would never use it . unless you want the `` ab lounge 2 '' to be a `` permanent '' fixture in your bedroom or living room , then i would order something else . i need this thing to be where i can easily use it then put it away ... ... .the ab lounge 2 is way too big bulky for that . unless you have a room where it will remain a permanent fixture , then do n't buy it . i 'm buying the `` ultra '' ab lounge because it folds for easy storage ... .it 's more expensive , but to me it 's worth the convenience of having the `` easy '' storage capability . i do n't my exercise equipment to be sitting in my bedroom or living room when it 's not in use .
0	unfortunately , i purchased this product . thermometer and compass are not at all working . thermometer always shows 65 f and compass allways shows err . i highly recommend not to buy this on
1	i ordered these for my husband for christmas and he loves them , he says that they are better than any that they have at his gym . very durable and only moderately padded , great for the price
0	this was given to me as a gift . i used it almost every day for about 1 1/2 months then a cable on it broke.it never even worked that well to begin with . i e-mailed the company for a new cable since it was covered under the warranty . they told me they had to order it from china and had no idea when it would come . they gave no apologies , they could not have cared less . eight months later after i had already gotten rid of the piece of junk they sent it to me ! ! ! ! ! i used it for 1 month the whole year ! ! how lame
1	a great multifunctional stove with lots of room . extremely functional with three burners and the side flaps helped keep the wind , dust , and other campground debris out of your food . propane is the only way to go when you 're cooking in the wild woods were doing some backwoods camping . while the stove has lots of room for cooking it folds down nicely making it a great compact pack along . a must-have for any camping trip
1	i bought this bike for my son for christmas and he loves it ! no problems with it so far , it is built well and the price was awesome .
1	this mat is great . my advice for all you yogis that ca n't keep your hands from reenacting starsky and hutch during downdog is to be a little patient or just creative . you have two options other than getting upset and throwing your new ( expensive ) mat in the back corner of your closet . first , i recommend that you buy an organic degreaser . give your mat a couple of sprays ( not too much ) , give it a scrub with a brush , hose it off , and hang it out to dry . this should help . option two is to put your mat in the washer on delicate cycle with cold water and baking soda . do n't use soap unless you really want to be embarrassed the next time you start sweating in your sun salutes . i put my mat in the washer and have n't had any problems , but i 'm not sure if manduka would actually endorse that . with that , and a little bit of wear and tear , you should end up with a solid mat .
0	i purchased this bike from a local dealer 15 months ago and it has broken down 3 times in the last 15 months . the resistence motor is defective which is what i have had replaced 3 times now . this motor does not allow you to change gears or bike through a program -- upgrading to shifiting on the fly technology would be a plus . the positive aspect of the bike is the comfort and grip heart rate monitor and the ability to swap out saddles also a plus . ovewrall i can not recommend this product .
1	we have a slightly sloped yard so i was hesitant about getting a trampoline . we tried it , and it works fine ! my kids love it ! of course , like any other toy , they take it in spells but it still gets used alot after 6 months . i was also concerned at first about them falling off of it . i almost bought the enclosure to go with it but i decided to wait and see how high they jumped , etc . this trampoline is so small , they really ca n't get a lot of `` air '' so they do n't do flips and other dangerous tricks . it 's also very low to the ground . i am glad now that i did n't get the enclosure . we do n't really need it . i would recommend this trampoline for younger kids . the weight limit is 120 lbs so it ca n't support larger kids . also , since it is so small , we only let our two preschoolers jump together . when we have guests over , it 's one at a time . i love it that my kids want to be outside so much . this is better money spent than on video games , in my opinion
1	my second pair . knew exactly what i wanted . small woman with small hands and small fit perfectly . great deal
1	i 've worked out with cathe for about 6 months now , and i have to say , this is one of my favorite workouts . it combines cardio with upper and lower body in a 60 minute circuit workout . the cardio bursts are short but intense- expect to jump , do power 15 's , fast feet shuffles , spike lunges , etc . lower body work - well , let 's just say , i hope you like to do leg press- since you 'll be doing it - a lot . there are a total of 6 sets of leg press - on each leg . also , cathe inserts some static lunges and squats , among other moves . she does hover squats with pulses of 16 over the high step- your quads will be feeling the burn , there ! arm work includes typical weighted and non-weight work , such as tricep dips off the high step , push ups , bicep curls , overhead extension , etc . overall , if you 're looking for a challenge and a new circuit workout to shock your muscles , this is the workout for you . beginners , beware- you can modify certain exercises ( i use dumbbells instead of a barbell ) - but this is more for the intermediate or advanced exerciser
1	i bought this bike after not riding since i was 14 ( 32 now ) . the box arrived in excellent condition and the bike was nearly completely assembled . i also had a little trouble with adjusting the front brake but got it figured out . overall this is a great bike for those casual trips around town . i 'm not a trail seeker , so have never tried it off road . very happy with the quality and ease of assembly
1	i recently got into gymnastics so i started looking for a leotard for someone with real curves . i 'm 5'6 '' and 180lbs and the xl fits me great . it has long sleeves which is great for the wintertime and i do n't have to feel self consciousness about my fat hanging out there because it covers it up . it 's cut low enough so that i 'm not getting wedgies and i can do handstands without worrying if my workout shirt got un-tucked . it 's not flashy so i do n't look like a 10 year old in a fat 26 year olds body . it 's nice and plain , gets the job done and i 'm sure the others at they gym thank me for covering up for goodness sakes
1	excellent product do n't hesitate this big umbrella is the perfect one to protect you and your equipment when rains start
0	the brunton nexus star is a low-cost , fairly rugged , basic compass . like any low-cost compass , if you know how to use it you can get where you want to go , but it lacks features you may later wish you had . on the plus side , it is lightweight , inexpensive , and fairly thin , so it does n't take up a lot of room in your pocket . on the minus side , the baseplate is very short , so it is harder to use with a map and a little less accurate when reading a bearing . the biggest disadvantage , in my opinion , is that it does n't have a true declination adjustment ; it is advertised as having a `` declination scale '' which is not the same . on a baseplate compass , you take a bearing by lining up the compass needle inside the north reference indicator ( sometimes called the `` doghouse '' ) etched on the bottom of the vial . compasses with true declination adjustment allow you to rotate this `` doghouse '' to align it with the desired declination . that way you always read a bearing by aligning the needle inside the doghouse . on the nexus star , however , you ca n't do this . instead , you have to remember to line up the compass needle with the point on the scale that corresponds to the local declination . in this case , the needle is not boxed inside the doghouse , and i find it can lead to errors , especially when you are tired and not thinking clearly after a long hike . if you always navigate using magnetic bearings rather than true bearings , this is n't a problem . i can recommend this compass for use with a gps receiver that is set to read magnetic bearings , and it is suitable as a back-up compass . i also regularly use it as an inexpensive tool to teach students in my gps classes how to use a compass , but i would n't recommend it for serious work
1	this - along with a pogo stick and stilts - was my effort to get my kids offf the video games at least some of the time ! i thought this might be too hard for the 6 year old , but he persisted and is getting better at it . the point is , it 's so fun he keeps trying ! the 13 yr old - and my 17 year old daughter are enjoying it too . there seems to be a trade-off between the stilts and the hit-a-way . only the little guy can handle the pogo stick - go figure
0	i went to a sports store and all they carried were sportline pedometers . i really did n't know which one to buy so i bought this one because it was more attractive than the bright yellow one and it was more expensive than the 340 so i thought it was better somehow . even though it says that it measures steps accurately on the packaging , it does n't actually display it . it only uses it to calculate the distance that you 've walked . i was very annoyed by this because the 340 does track and display the number of steps walked . i got over it but the thing keeps resetting in my pocket . i 'm just going to buy another pedometer . one that displays the steps walked and has a cover
1	just like the ones used in college intra-murals , excellent stitching and look to be very durable . fast shipping , and great deal
1	i thought the dvd was excellent from the standpoint of a person not having much experience in lifting or exercising . it shows great technique and form . i used to be a wrestler in the highly competitive state of iowa so over the years i learned many of these pushup and workout techniques . pushups and dumbbells used to be my main source of lifting and staying in shape . i found myself to be too advanced for the power 10 workout so the video seemed like common knowledge . so for beginners and more advanced people looking for a great dvd focusing on developing proper form and technique this is an excellent dvd . the dvd takes you through many different styles of pushups showing the proper form and setup . it then does about a set of three of that style pushup to show you the routine in live workout motion . with the dvd purchase i was hoping to find an exercise program , approximately 30-45 minutes long , that sets up a nice workout routine for people short on time . i was hoping for a video that combines a variety of different pushups using the perfect pushup into a nice timed workout . a workout that works my chest , back , arms , abs , and some cardio into a nice overall workout that is done in short time . something similar to a tae bo style video or other timed exercise videos . the power 10 workout is n't that type of video . it is more specifically a technique video that one can evntually combined into a workout of their own . i recently wrote some emails to the body rev president suggesting the development of a video for more advanced people that provides a fast , effective workout routine that one could get at the gym , but can do at home in 30-45 minutes with their perfect pushup . he seemed pretty impressed by the idea so hopefully bodyrev builds on this dvd like they have for their other products .
1	i mainly get stuff like this because i like the looks , not that i actually use the merchandise that much . the knife seems sturdy and strong . the nylon sheath is high quality .
0	i bought a gustbuster umbrella several months ago , expecting that it 'd be the last umbrella i ever needed . wow , was that a bad decision . this `` windproof '' umbrella had two of the spokes break in a light wind ( the weather report said the winds that day were only about 15 miles per hour ) . so i e-mailed the company because i remembered that it had a `` lifetime guarantee . '' they told me that i 'd have to ship it back to them ( which is perfectly fine ) , but i 'd also have to pay them $ 10 for their trouble . what kind of lifetime guarantee is that ? for $ 10 or less i could buy another umbrella locally . their product has proven that it 's not superior and it does n't live up to the claims they make for it . do n't spend all this extra money on a gustbuster because you think it 'll work better . it wo n't . go out and buy a normal umbrella for 1/3 or 1/4 the price of a gustbuster -- you 'll probably get the same amount of use out of the normal umbrella , and you wo n't be paying an outrageous price for something that does n't work the way their marketing claims
0	i had a lot of fun with this stove while it lasted but it did not last long -- about six months ! i live on a sailboat and i used it every day ; maybe someone who goes camping once a year will have a better experience . the burner did not simmer well ( the flame kept creeping back up ) but the grill worked great until the stove itself died . it seems to have a design flaw -- the regulator has an unusually narrow diameter tube and the propane tubes inside the stove are flimsy and wobbly . i called century and they said this is the way the stove is supposed to be . hmmmm . i did not think it would last long but i liked it so much that when it died i tried out another one . this one was immediately defective and i took it back . neither century nor coleman seems to make a tough propane stove any more . camp chef may be a better , though much more expensive , choice for a person who does a lot of camping
0	i ordered and received this item through the golf warehouse . it arrived and i immediately saw a defect , in that the magnetic balls would not release correectly , even with major force . i contacted the golf wrehouse and they told me to return the item to them . i requested a refund but they refused this saying the item showed signs of use and returned it to me . since then i have tried to contact david leadbetter 's organization but without any success . i am desperately unhappy about this purchase and , in particular , the after sales service . derek price toronto , o
1	i got this bike and i instantly liked it . the only problem was the seat could not fit properly to the base . i tried many times to tighten it up but does n't help . well , other than that its a wonderful bike , zip noise and would burn a lot of calories ... ... ...
0	this tiny item ships for $ 2 more than it costs . i 'll purchase it elsewhere
1	loved this mat ! great for taller yogis . great tickness too ... a bit slippery but after a couple of sessions it wears off i totally recommend it !
0	expedited shipping was erroneously entered for this order . tried to change and then cancel it minutes after entry and repeatedly until it came to no avail . refused package a month ago . exorbitant charge made to my credit card and i will have to seek resolution with them , since amazon takes no responsibility . vendor has not responded to over 20 calls and emails to cancel/refund order . amazon places orders with sketchy vendors like this and then you 're stuck with erroneous charges . beware ! !

0	i have been using a polar s610 for some time . when everything is working it is a wonderful device . however , it is difficult to keep it running smoothly . for example , when i upgrade to a new computer i go through hell getting the software to work again . polar customer service is useless . most recently i have been unable to upload data from the monitor to my pc via usb for months . i do not believe i will be able cure the problem without purchasing new software + the software dose not include the usb connection software . that is sold seperately . polar will not provide replacement software unless you purchase it on cd . the rest of the world will provide software and upgrades to registered users online . bottom line - the product is pretty good . however in terms of user friendly polar is a total failure . sorry folks - why not get a garmin 305 - i a
1	i looked at several inversion tables before deciding on my life gear and have no regrets in buying it . i am 6'2 '' and weigh 220 lbs . and it performs beautifully for me . it is well built and the memory foam makes it comfortable to lay on . it was easy to assemble and took only a short time before i was using it . i have found that just a few minutes will relax me and has helped my arthritis too . i no longer have pain in my neck or between my shoulders . i would strongly urge people who have had back surgery to consult with their doctor before using any inversion table because they do stretch your back
1	this gun is awsome it is the best gun you will ever get for such a good price and guns that are 10 20 or even 30 dollars more the gun is very very light and looks great you can take of the front and the arm rest to make it look like as machine gun or something scope is great and is a super accurate gun i have shot a can down from farther than 40 feet ( one shot ) the laser is not super good and hard to use but it comes seperate so you can put it on or take it of whenever a bb might ratle around in their once in a while but it will fall out over all greatest gun ever ! !
0	i received my stamina products adjustable hyperextension bench on march 13th of '07 and was very disappointed . there was hardly any insulation whatsoever in the box and it looked like it was just thrown in the box . the product was scratched and parts were broken . fortunately the bench works , but it looks like it is already a few years old with all the damage . the product seems to be of quality , it 's just unfortunate that sps does n't understand how important that packaging is and if it is insufficient it makes the product look cheap
0	the handle bars keep loosening up which in turn makes it very dangerous . also , the base metal footboard is cracking . i would n't spend the money on this scooter . it 's not worth it . spend your money on a cheaper model razor .
1	it 's more expensive than some , but it 's well-made , works perfectly , and will last for years . not requiring removal of the top to pour is great . just buy it already
1	the two most respected bodybuilding supplements are ( 1 ) whey protein and ( 2 ) creatine . they are also considered natural products or food products . while whey is without a doubt extremely useful , creatine does not help everybody . i have used creatine monohydrate in the past and i found it to be useless . it was so utterly ineffective that i just felt robbed of my hard earned money . my tub still sits in the cupboard . i have never used any other supplement products other than the ones that seem to be on the safe side as these both are . i heard about no-xplode from some bodybuilders who seemed to think it was probably one of the best supplement products to come out in years . i researched it and it appears that bsn has formulated a surging `` creatine + nitric oxide '' drink that seems to work with most people . not everybody sees results but this stuff worked for me and that is what counts . although no-xplode contains some serious chemistry ( see below ) and possibly some debatable compounds ( guanidino propionic acid [ gpa ] and glycocamine ) it is probably well worth the very low-level risks for the results . 40 minutes after taking this stuff i can either cardio high intensity for 30 min flat ( maybe even more ) and complete a full range of compound weight lifts in the gym without feeling any interruption in my power . no fatigue . the surge is exactly as it promises . you will feel that you have nitro pumping around your body . it sets in at about 20 minutes for me . i feel a little woozy at first , disorientated , then my brain picks up and my body feels energetic . put it into action and you will see results . it also boats a cem3 type of creatine that prevents you from bloating up like monohydrate does . i never have stepped much outside of what is considered safe but in my opinion no-xplode is standing on the fence saying i am about the best bang for your buck without any serious side effects . so far this stuff is getting very good feedback . yes it contains lots of mind boggling ingredients , but if you are looking for the creatine edge , even if creatine has never worked for you before , then no-xplode is probably the one . it can also help build muscle , but even if it does n't for you , it is still worth it for the surge . i am very glad that i got it . very . serving size : 1 scoop ( 20.5g ) servings per container : 40 amount per serving : calories : 36 -calories from fat : 0 total fat : 0g -saturated fat : 0g cholesterol : 0mg sodium : 150mg potassium : 75mg total carbohydrates : 9g -sugars : 0g protein : 0g vitamin b6 : 25mg - ( pyridoxine hcl ) vitamin b12 : 120mcg - ( cyanocobalamine ) folic acid : 400mcg magnesium : 360mg phosphorus : 500mg calcium : 75mg no-xplode proprietary blend : 20,500mg ( no-xplode contains a patent pending nutrient suspension matrix efforsorb delivery system ) no meta-fusion ( patent pending ) ( l-arginine akg , citral-m ( citrulline malate ) , l-citrulline akg , l-histidine akg , rc-nos ( rutacarpine 95 % ) , gynostemma pentaphyllum ( 95 % gypenosides ) , nad ( nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ) muscle volumizing creatine matrix ( patent pending ) cem3 ( creatine ethyl ester malate ) , 2cm ( dicreatine malate ) , betapure ( trimethylglycine ) , glycovol ( glycocyamine ) , guanipro ( guanidino proplonic acid ) , cinnulin pf ( aqueous cinnamon extract ) , keto-isocaproate potassium ener-tropic xplosion ( patent pending ) l-tyrosine , taurine , endurlac ( glucuronolactone ) , l-tyrosine akg , methylxanthines ( caffeine ) , mct 's ( medium chain triglycerides ) , vinpocetine 99 % , vincamine 99 % , vinburnine 99 % phospho-electrolyte replacer calcium phosphate , magnesium oxide , potassium phosphate , sodium phosphate glycerol hydrating polymers potassium glycerophosphate , magnesium glycerophosphate , glycerola stearat
0	... intentional rip off ? there is no 50 minute work out dvd included . the pump included does not work ( after pumping air for 20 minutes straight does n't even put a dent on the deflated ball ) and becomes very hot after a while . i kept thinking the plastic pump is going to melt before the ball enflates ( if ever ) . the `` 65cm '' ball turns out to be only `` 55cm . '' i do n't know ... seems like a rip off to me , but amazon is not at fault , since the nautlius web site has the exact same description for the item . quality-wise , the tko cory everson fitness ball 55cm i got a while back was so much better . the plastic is n't so sticky , and it felt a lot more durable than the nautlius one , too

0	do not do not do not do not buy any products from the weslo company . i just received my `` weslo cadence c44 treadmill '' and have attempted to assemble it . the handrail holes are not drilled in the proper spots so that they may be attached correctly to the console . the customer service numbers are all disconnected . their website gives an additional number to call , and a recorded message tells you to either call the now disconnected numbers , or puts you on hold for about 2 minutes before it hangs up on you . i have wasted an entire afternoon trying to contact them . this company is a complete scam . if you are even considering buying one of their products , your money is better spent getting your head checked
1	i bought this from lifeline recently and it has been an excellent addition to my home gym equipment . i 'm not a person who travels back and forth to a gym each day . i also do not like paying an arm and a leg for expensive pieces of workout equipment that eventually become expensive coat racks . this workout solution is about as low tech as it can get . i agree with the previous reviews below -- you could almost make this one yourself . it consists of a strip of mesh webbing -- like seatbelt material ; two adjustable , quick locking clips ; handles made of webbing and plastic tubes ; and another piece of plastic tubing that locks the jungle gym into place when the door is shut . the equipment is simple , but sets up in seconds . the clips adjust quickly and are incredibly secure . it 's so simple -- but it really works . the emphasis of the instruction sheet and the dvd that came along with it , is in upper body strength . you can do chin ups -- by regulating height , you can work up from lifting part of your body weight to full body weight . for me , this was the best part of the jungle gym . my chin ups/pull ups have improved remarkably by using the device . body rows , push ups , and fly push ups are also possible . using the jungle gym , pushups take on a new dimension with a fuller range of motion ( like an atlas pushup ) and given the instability of the webbing , you also get more of a core workout . you can use the webbing for balance as well as to maintain better technique when doing squats . you can also make the exercises more challenging by using a fitness ball . you can do abdominal crunches by holding the handles and lifting your feet from the floor . some exercises ( full body rows and dips ) are difficult when attached to a door and lifeline suggests draping the jungle gym over a tree limb so you can achieve a truly vertical workout . i have not yet tried using this over a tree limb ... however , i was able to perform the dips with some creativity while attached to a door but it was not easy . this is not a full fitness solution . but when used in conjunction with weights and exercise bands , it really makes the home gym complete . i have searched for a pull up bar for a long time that is removable , but none of the current offerings fit the odd sized door frames and moldings of my 99 year old house . the jungle gym has worked . given the ability to do pull ups of varying difficulty , it has also improved my ability to do pull ups/chin ups over a short period of time . the downside of the device is that it requires a sturdy door and door frame . i would be leery of using the device is the door does not close securely and lock or if you are worried about the integrity of your house 's construction . remember , the jungle gym is strong enough to hold your body weight , but the door it is connected to has to be able to do the same . if not , you will find yourself flat on your back with a new home improvement project to do . remember too , that when your feet are touching the ground and you do pull towards the door , the weight decreases as you pull . this is not a defect of the device , it 's just the physics of the situation . ( with free weights , the weight is stable throughout your range of motion . with exercise bands the weight increases as the band lengthens . ) also , this is a great device for weight/circuit training , but is not really an aerobic solution . the jungle gym , along with a few exercise bands are ideal for travel . i used mine with three lifeline exercise bands ( 2 r6s and 1 r8 ) , exercise band door attachment and the lifeline triple grip handles . this yielded a gym that weighed less than two pounds , fit in my suitcase easily and allowed for a variety of body weight and resistance exercises
0	we have in the past owned an in step single jogger . it was n't perfect but it certainly met our needs . it always needed to be tipped back to change direction and it rusted a little because we left it outside . if we had stayed as an only child family it would have continued working but with the addition of another baby we decided to sell it . after being in transition for over a year and now that the weather is warming up we decided to get a double jogger for strolling . we purchased the in step run around ltd 2 jogging stroller in hopes it would meet our new needs . the problems of the single stroller seemed compounded in the double stroller . my husband had no problem getting it together but complained about the cheap caliper style break ... it does n't stop the stroller and barely even slows it down . it took him the same amount of time to work on the break as it took him to assemble the whole jogger . after that we placed our three year old and our 18 month old in it for a test ride . when placing them in we encountered our next problem ... the seats even at the highest point are super reclined . they wanted no part of laying back but instead were both utterly thrilled to sit far forward and mess with each other . as for the straps a six inch long safety label sewn to the webbing made it almost impossible to thread them through the front buckle . so off we set on our test drive . it was really hard to push and almost impossible to turn . after a while we figured out that letting the kids sit so far forward threw off the balance of the whole jogger . the only way to make it partially work was to let out both seats to the fully reclined position , criss-cross the shoulder straps and constantly yell `` stay down kids ... if you sit up one more time i 'm going to sit in it and make you push me ! '' well we got home from our test run and my husband pulled out the cardboard box and with a resigned air began the job of taking it apart . i do n't recommend this item . in all honesty our radio flyer pathfinder wagon does the job more effectivel
0	field in a bag claims to be `` the perfect way to get a baseball game going '' . while this may be true , the number of games you can actually play with this set will be one ( if the set even makes it through the game ) . first off , with these bases you must set up the field using the wooden mallet the pound a flimsy plastic stake into the ground . with one of my sets ( i bought 3 unfortunatly at the same time not knowing their reputation ) , the wooden mallet was n't even glued together , it had fallen apart so i had to just use the head . then when i put the stakes into the ground , out of the 3 sets i had , at least 1 in each set broke while i was placing them . to actually place the bases , the set gives you a string device that helps you measure out the field . this was handy except for the fact that it took me 10 min to untangle the mess and then when i went to second base realized the string was not long enough . granted , one could place 1st and 3rd and then figure out where 2nd went but the picture in the set-up shows that the string will measure the base ; however , it definintely is not the right length . after placing the bases the team is now ready to play . however , do n't wear cleats with these bases . the bottom of the base says , not recommended for use with cleats and boy were they right ! with our game we had tball children using the bases and even their little cleats ( and not all the kids had cleats ) tore them to shreds . our bases lasted about one hour before they were torn and the inside cotton coming out . it was very unfortunate seeing as though we purchased three sets and all were done by the end of an hour . this non-profit wo n't see that money again : ) so unless you plan on using these bases on the grass for easy set-up , do not plan on wearing cleats , and not playing a true game of baseball/softball ... .you would probably be better off buying the $ 8 flat bases for temporary use ( and they can be left outside afterward too ) . - just not impressed , sorr
0	do not buy this gun from hot import toys . that is my main point . it took a very long time to get to me ( 8 days ) and when it did , it was broken . not that it was shattered or it was jammed . it just did n't work . the piston seemed to be fine , the motor seemed to be connected , the gearbox seemed to be in tact , the batter ( although a little hard to install ) was charged , and the trigger was connected to the gear box . i thought that i could return it for either a working gun or just a refund . no . i e-mailed hit over 7 times over the course of a couple weeks . nothing ! i got no response , no notification , nothing . i continued e-mailing them because they did n't even post a phone number to reach them at on their site ! hit is the worst company to buy from ever ! from what i see and know , this gun seems to be quite the mpeg ! i would have loved to use it to its fullest with my friends but unfortunately , i bet you anyhting that hit will decide to wait until the 30 day warranty has expired before they e-mail me back : telling me of how the warranty time is up and that they are n't allowed to exchange my product . buy from airsplat ! ! ! trust me . this is a good gun . fast , accurate , good looking . do not waste a month of your time waiting for it to arrive , having to find its broke , waiting for them to e-mail you back , and then have to live with a broken , useless piece of potential airsoft gun . so trust me , do n't buy from hot import toys
0	if you expect this to play music by itself , you will be dissapointed . basically , each foot is a sqeeze horn . it 's not bad a plush but as a musical toy , it 's horrible
1	this is a better stroller than the other three ( all for one child ) strollers we have . very maneuverable and adjustable . it turns on a dime and seats adjust up and down independently . folds down very quickly . it 's great that the kids can sit next to each other .
1	this inflatable kayak is a hoot ! i bought one yesterday and did about 12 miles on the truckee river through reno in it with my teenage son . ( yes , i am incredibly stiff and sore , and he 's raring to go again . ) first of all realize that this does not handle like a hardbody kayak . close , but not quite . it is just a pointy rubber raft , after all . it likes to go down the river sideways or backwards , depending upon where the heaviest bottom sits . but , it can be easily paddled by one or two persons to float just like the real thing . about thirty years ago i used to have a fiberglass kayak and went down many rivers here in the western usa . i 've worn wool long underwear under a wetsuit to stay warm and have almost lost camera gear and food in rollovers . i kinda know how to handle a kayak . this sevylor should not be taken through anything greater than a 4 , depending upon the skill of the paddler . it rides like a typical rubber raft through crests and holes . it might be fun to play with solo in standing waves , but it would be hard to brace into because there are no foot/heel rests . there is no way to stay in it in a rollover . you 'll just get dumped out . on the practical side , it only weighs about 23 pounds , can be had for around $ 140 , inflates easily and quickly with a plunger air pump ( sold separately ) , is easily portaged around the rough water , has a very shallow draft , is made from some very tough pvc , is comfortable to sit in for several hours , is easy to dump water out of , cleans off quickly with just a hose , and deflates in a heartbeat to be folded back into the size of a medium suitcase . for us , it is perfect - affordable , handy in the waters we frequent , easy to inflate/deflate/store . i 'm thinking of getting another one so that he can have his own , and so that i wo n't get quite as splashed-on from his flailing paddling . he can also tow old mom on the wide slow parts . sue : )
0	at first they kept the water out of my eyes and were comfortable . but after 3 or 4 times they had some water leakage . i use them for recreational swimming at the ymca . but am already looking for another swim goggle . i hope you post this even though i gave them a poor rating . thank you , eileen
1	this is a pretty good quality pack for the money . it looks good and feels well built . the height adjustment is a little tricky to adjust until you get used to it . it uses velcro panels to hold itself in place ( plus a locking strap to secure it once it 's adjusted ) and you need to pull them both out to be able to adjust it up or down . it was very comfortable to wear over the course of my very first 2 day backpacking trip . my only real complaint with this pack is that one of the accessory loops on the bottom of the pack which was securing my tent to the outside of the pack ripped about 3 hours into the first day , which required me to figure out another way to carry my tent . fortunately there are plenty of extra loops/pockets to hold things and clip thing on with and i was able to use those to secure my tent to the pack . so you do get what you pay for but this is probably one of the better packs out there in this price range .
1	my husband and i finished off a bottle of wine before assembling the unit . : ) it only took us an hour and a half to assemble , and our kids were running around like a couple of nuts during the process . after we finished the assembly , we both took a turn on a preset program . the machine is extremely sturdy , quiet , and worked like a charm - just like a unit found at a gym . we 're extremely pleased with our purchase and would recommend it to anyone
0	this is not the same model i bought but it looks like it 's built the same way . i bought the inmotion trampoline by stamina and it was completely destroyed in under 3 months with regular use . it did n't have springs but had elastic bands that ripped off . when i called for warrantey information , i had waited too long , it is only guaranteed for 90 days . i 'd give it negative stars , but i have to rate it at least 1 star to get the review to show up
0	i previously owned and used the 5 mi . version to communicate with my wife while i am going to and from the school bus stop for the kids . from the bus stop the 5 mi . unit was iffy . i purchased the 16 mi . units thinking the little extra power and range would make for better receive at the bus stop . it was worse . we received no signal whatsoever , not a peep . do n't buy this unit . save your money and buy the 5 mi unit
1	just a really great sports toy for kids . my son is 9 and he is already pretty good at it , but it is hard to keep my 15 year old from stealing it and riding it himself . i would highly recommend the flowboard for lots of outdoor fun .
1	this has to be one the best protein supplements in the market ! and more importantly , the taste is just unbelievable ! the banana creme and vanilla flavors are the best . from a `` supplement facts '' perspective , each rtd bottle is packed with 32 , yeah 32g of protein , and only 14g of carbohydrates ! the total fat is 16g which might be on the higher side , again 6g of which are in the form of mct ( medium chain triglycerides ) that are typically burned as energy and are n't stored as body fat ! all in all , it works really good for me and if you are an active person like i am , you should prolly go get yourself some . ( gnc also sells this for like 3 bucks
0	i bought the chair for my mother . she really wanted the chair so that she can start working out on it . she loved it . it looks very nice , the size is alot bigger than what i thought it would be , which is a good thing . the only problem i have is that every time she uses it , one of the screws comes out and the arm comes loose . she is very disappointed with that because she 's afraid to use it now . i 'm not sure what can be done to rectify this problem , but it something that needs to be taken care of . aside from that , it took a very long time for the item to come in and i 'm very upset with the fact that we had to wait so long to receive it , and now she ca n't really even use it !
1	i purchased my leki nordic walking poles because i read somewhere that these poles would reduce stress on my hips and knees while walking . that is totally true ! i have a congenital malformation in my right hip which prevents me from ever being able to run or jog as a means for exercise . i do love to walk , but was hindered by the pain from my right hip . by using the walking poles , i am able to walk quickly without any pain at all , even though i am actually using more muscle groups than i would if walking without the use of poles . walking alone , a person only uses about 50 % of the large muscle groups . walking with leki nordic walking poles , one will use up to 90 % of all the large muscle groups ; this turns a simple 30 minute walk into a full-body workout without stress ! ! i would not walk any other way now that i own my leki poles !
0	this ramp is terribly designed for a skateboard . first of all , i thought this would be a bit larger . when i tried to go off of the ramp , my nose hit the front of it . not only is it not fun , but you need to weigh it down if you dont want to slide around . if you are considering purchasing this item for use with a skateboard , i recommend something else .
1	i am very pleased with the quality of the inversion therapy table . it is sturdy , reasonably priced , and it was easy to assemble . instructions provided were clear and concise
0	i received this trike with 3 flat tires . the 12 inch tire tube needed to be replaced . the valve in the other two tires were defective and had to be replaced
1	this is an item that will bring smiles to the faces of everyone except the person putting with it , as long as the control unit is in possession of someone else . it is also useful for true accurate training , but a little humor never hurts
0	i consider my dogs to be small - they are all around 25 pounds . i have had to tighten everything on the backpack to keep them from being too loose and i still feel like they are a little bit too big . i think that for a `` small '' backpack , that they are just too large . thank you
0	this pump did not work very well for me . must pump it with much force fast and is more of a hassle then a help . i wound up putting it away and walking my bike to a gas station instead
0	its light was okay , although it could not quite cover an entire page of a book . the main problem is it 's too shabby to survive a battery change -- so you will get just 40 hours of use before it runs out . also , finding 3v lithium batteries is not easy .
1	my 13 yr old wanted this and a waveboard for christmas . since his dad and i are divorced , he ended up with both . i got him the flowboard and he loves it . of course , i tried it too and was shocked to find it was actually easier for me to play with than his regular skateboard . there is no chance i 'm even going to try the waveboard , as i do value my intact bones . i 've been wanting to learn how to snowboard and this definitely gives the feeling of snowboarding , but without the snow ! it 's well made , fun and definitely a hit
1	i had a hard time looking for a larger helmet that would fit me , i even tried using giro altas ii but not quite . good thing bell triton fit 's just right .
1	these flashlights are made in china . that is not too surprising nowadays and is in no way an adverse comment on their quality and construction which seem to live up to what we might hope from a traditional american brand such as smith wesson . i have two of these and i expect them to last me the rest of my life . ( i am 60 . ) a tad expensive ( which is why only four stars ) but small enough to be convenient , bright enough to be useful and efficient enough to be inexpensive to operate . i bought these flashlights for use during blackouts but their convenience has me using them for illumination whenever i am fiddling around with cables behind the tv or under the office desk or inside the computer . the small size means they are easy to hold in an armpit or in the same hand as another tool . i also bought the red-led version for use in the car so as not to affect night vision
1	ca n't really go wrong here . a metal post , some rubber grips , and a couple of wheels . it works great , and was the cheapest i found . just a tip , if you 've never used it before , do n't try to be a tough guy and do a rep from your feet . you may be tough , but you might also hurt your back . start on your knees until you know for sure you 're a tough guy
0	i used this ball with exercise video 4 times . on the 5th day , my 16 yr old daughter was sitting on it talking on the phone and it exploded , sounded like a tire blowing out and the ball ended up with a two foot piece blown out of it not just a hole .
1	i purchased this snorkel equipment for a vacation in aruba and i used it for 4 days of snorkeling . i had always rented snorkel gear before and this was the first time i decided to purchase a set . i am very pleased with this purchase . the fins are fantastic . the design of this fin from us divers with the split in the middle makes it extremely easy to move through the water - it 's a great design feature ! the snorkel mask was comfortable and it never leaked . the set also comes with a great blue and gray backpack that you can store all of your gear in
0	the first unit was installed as directed and when it was working it was fine . the problem was it would just stop working and this was most of the time . i exchaned several e-mails with customer service rep pat . she was extremely nice and suggested i send it back for a replacement . the second unit was installed as directed and worked flawlessly for a couple of months . it now works a bit better than the first one . instead of stops working most of the time , this one stops working some of the time . i have decided to keep this one because of the bother and expense of shipping it back for a replacement . and who knows , the next unit may not work at all . not a good product for amazon to be selling . r lockwoo
0	the only thing on this that works well is the watch ... the altimeter , thermometer and compass even after being calibrated give incorrect readings ... the stopwatch is difficult to start and stop and reseting it to zero takes some patience ... it looks cool and the time is correct but it is definitely not a reliable device in the least .
0	i got the pedometer and from the start it does not work ! ! you have to physically shake it for it to count a step ! i 'm returning right away
1	i was surprised at how good this worked with very little uncomfortableness while sleeping . it didnt take much pressure on the toes to be able to get up in the morning with very little pain on my heal . had problems for the last 4 months before the thermoskin . have been using it 2 weeks now and am already trying to slowly get back to running . great product
1	we pruchased this tent for our annual car camping trip in northern mi , where weather is very unpredictable . we 've had other tents that took forever to set up , but this one was super simple . i think it too two of us less than 15 minutes to have it up and ready . we loved the size of this tent - plenty of room for our air mattress and gear . the air circulation was great , too . even in the heat of the day , we had a nice breeze keeping us cool , thanks to a miriad of windows . when rain came during the night , we stayed dry , though i would recommend sealing the seams prior to using this tent . overall , we 're really happy with this tent ( especially for the price ! ) , and plan to use it for several years
0	this pedometer is easy to use and pretty decent looking . those are the only good things i can say about it . it simply does not stay on . i , too , have had to use a safety pin to make sure i do n't lose it . maybe i have a defective device , but this is anything but accurate . i consistently walk a measured 5 mile route every day . one day the steps will be 5800 , the next day 12800 , the next day 10300 . which is accurate ? are any of them ? i ca n't rely on it . when testing the device for accuracy in walking 50 steps , it never got it right . most of the time it was over the 50 steps , 2 times it was way under the 50 steps . i would not recommend this one
0	i only had the gazelle for one month when the noise began . it started as a low annoying squeak but gradually the noise increased to the point where it is difficult to hear anything else . very annoying ! also , the calorie monitor is no where near accurate and the heart rate monitor is worse . while it is a low impact machine , it strains the ball of the foot because of the awkward angle of the pedals . this is not the machine to get if you want any sort of a workout . i am selling mine and buying an elliptical machine . do not waste your money
1	i recived the paint quickly and it as in great condition . i only had 1 bad ball in the whole pack of 1000
1	i originally bought the blue ( 5 lb ) , red ( 7 lb ) and the black ( 9 lb ) gripmasters for my 14 year old boys . the blue is a little too easy for gripping but excellent for exercising the ring and little finger . the blue was too easy for them so they did not use it so i ended inherited it . it is pretty habit forming and fun to use because the tension is light , this makes it good for use anytime , anywhere . ( i have used it stuck in traffic and it is also a good stress reliever ) if i had to do it again , i would have probably not bought this tension unless you have a very light grip , probably have started with the red . just remember that this is mainly for fingers and hand exercise so very easy to use for gripping , the challenge is working out the fingers . it is not like using the regular heavy hand grippers . it has increased my hand strength and grip just by having it with me and using it during the course of the day without planned workouts . great product , excellent for finger or hand exercise , good quality
0	i rarely get taken , but i did this time . one song played 50 times . no instructions . pad not in tune with tv movements . this is going to a garage sale or charity
1	i bought this for my neighbors little girl and she loved it ! it was easy to put together , just took a few minutes , and away she went ! great price and i got a big hug
0	well , first of all i ordered this product on amazon and they sent me something completely different , they sent me roller skates with the wheels side by side instead of the roller blades i ask for like in the picture . then when i sent an e-mail trying to exchange the product , no one returns my calls or e-mails me back , after so long of trying it 's already past the 30 day exchange policy . so yeah , if you want a better review , contact me so i can exchange the product
1	i looked for years to get the bozo punching bag as it was a part of my youth . finally i located it and purchased it for my grandson , 7 . he loves it as does all of his family who use it to take out their frustrations . lol built very sturdy as he drags it around the backyard as well
0	i ordered the smack and yack : disney cars sally , lightning and ramone for christmas . the only one of them that worked consistently after a few minutes was ramone . sally and lightning only worked sporadically after a few minutes and then after about an hour , they would n't work at all . i ended up having to order the same ones again because my daughter was so upset that they stopped working on christmas . i hope the new ones work for a longer time than the orginal purchases
1	i bought this doll on ebay for my daughter for christmas because it wasnt available in stores . my daughter who just turned 6 yrs old loves this doll . doll speaks both english and spanish . the only thing i dont like is that this baby keeps going to sleep after meals , but if your child wants to keep it awake you can press the bracelet or put the bottle in the mouth . its a good thing if you dont want to run out of batteries soon or to give the doll some rest
0	my 7 year old son received the giga ball for christmas . it was a big hit . he and all of his cousins had a great time with it for several hours . unfortunately , the very next day , it pretty much fell apart . i did n't expect it would last very long , but had hoped that it would last more than one day
1	i played `` atmosfear , the harbingers '' on vhs in the mid-90s and several years later bought a copy of the game through ebay . then , i saw this dvd update and gave in to temptation when the price was marked down . here 's my judgement : 1 ) the mechanics have been simplified . this has it 's pros and cons . it could have been made easier to learn without removing as many components . 2 ) the gatekeeper has less of a nasty/funny balance in the dvd update . 3 ) it is a major upswing to have his dialogue randomly disbursed . one reviewer seemed to think the game was boring . i 'll guess , instead , that the people he parties with do n't have the attention span for board games . too bad for them . atmosfear - the dvd board game get 's a b+ from me
0	quick shipping on product but the product was not what i was hoping for . the `` snow '' was much grainer than i had expected . i had seen what i thought was the same item in stores during the holiday season and that `` instant snow '' was very fine and really looked like snow . this product does n't look much like snow and does n't have the same texture
0	this is one of the most beautiful looking barbies we have ever bought . it is also the worst doll to date ! the doll never worked from day one . it 's tail bent up and it made grinding noises and did n't move or swim - just laid there . all the reviews on this site ( which seemed to have disappeared since i notified mga - the toy maker ) were correct - not one buyer had a working doll ! ! ! we bought this for my daughter , niece and friend - and none of the 3 worked . it 's not hard to follow the directions - they are pretty simple - so that is not the problem . also , the hair falls out and is everywhere in the bath water ( pretty gross ) , and the bikini top is near impossible to get back on correctly ! overall , the biggest disappointment in a toy so far
1	my son is 4 1/2 and he loved the set . he and his dad set it up on christmas and enjoyed ringing the bell . i would recommend this for kids any age
1	he 's into firetrucks and mickey mouse so you could n't ask for a better toy . it 's small enough to ride around the house without running into everything , but also durable enough to play outside with . it 's the first thing he goes for in the morning and the last thing he 's playing with at night ( most days )
1	this thing is great . our 4 year old loves it . the working drawbridge , breakaway wall for cannon fire and trap door are great . considering the size and number of pieces , it was remarkably easy to put together . allow 2 to 3 hours for assembly , but the directions are excellent . only complaint is that some of the small pieces that do n't always want to stay together - some of the `` details '' will likely be missing after a few weeks . overall , very happy with it
0	my son received this as a gift when he was 15 months old -- he was already much too tall for the toy ! the box advertizes height adjustment , which simply allows you to lift it up about a half an inch . however , even if he were smaller , the base does not even come close to providing the necessary stability to stand up to even a soft swing ! my son was amused by the lights and sounds for a brief period of time , but quickly lost complete interest in the toy .
1	i bought this for my 5-year old daughter . she really enjoyed using it and actually enjoyed the challenge of having to figure out the answers in the shortest time possible . the different levels of difficulty are useful so she can keep using it over the years
0	i got this as a gift for my 18 month old son . it only produces one lousy bubble with each pull of the handle , very sad . my son got very frustrated and so did i. i would not recommend this product .
1	i first purchased the winnie the pooh soft 'n silly tigger for my son when he was 4 months old . he is now 14 months and loves his tigger . we now have 2 tiggers , one as a back up , and he carries them everywhere he goes . it 's a great toy for young children to sleep with , being soft and cuddly . tigger has been a great comfort for my son and i do n't know what i would have done with out them !
0	i ordered 6 supreme moo mixers . they did arrive before christmas . i received 6 standard moo mixers that should have been priced lower . i notified the company of the error and did n't receive a response . very disappointed . shame on them . i 'm a victum of bait and switch ... .
1	we gave our nine yr. old grandson this train for christmas . he had a such a good time putting it together , then running it on the track . the train absolutely glides on the track , so quietly and smoothly . it is a great product
0	i bought this for my son 's birthday last night since he is interested in music . as i was wrapping it , i noticed half of the keys were stuck in the up position . i took it out and managed to bang the keys back into place , wondering how many times i was going to have to do this . i decided to test it once i fixed it because the toy just looked horribly cheap with very thin plastic keys ( you can even see through them ) . the dollar store has better toys than this . the sound is horrible and uncontrollable . the controls are worthless . i 'm returning it today , and good riddance
0	i think this product needs a lot of hands-on supervision . my son slipped off and knocked the wind out himself twice on the 2nd day of trying this . after a couple of weeks , he finally regained his confidence to try it when a friend was over -- and his 6 y.o . friend slipped and knocked the wind out of herself ( almost had to call the paramedics ) . knowing what i know now ... i would not buy this product for kids under 8 ( follow the age recommendations ! ! ! ! ! ) . i would like to take a pair of wire cutters and cut it down ... .
0	my 6 year old son wanted this so badly from santa . well , he got it and it is sitting in his bedroom and has been there since the 28th of dec. what was a fun attention grabber initially became a boring , furry annoyance rather quickly . it is cute but there are several things that i ( and my son ) found wrong with the product . when he is supposed to be sleeping his eyes do n't close all the way ... kind of creepy especially for something that looks so real ! then his arms that move up and down and are supposed to close in an attempt to give you a hug make a horrible grinding noise ! my son was shocked by the grinding and got upset that his monkey was broken . i explained it away by saying that he probably just needed a backrub . what else are you going to tell a child on christmas morning when his first choice present turns out to be a bummer ? ! cute toy in theory , not so much in person though . i would not recommend this toy
0	it says that it works with vibration , maybe if you are dancing on a trampoline . the kids are not really that impressed
1	we recently played bonkers at our game club . as we read the instructions we were hoping going bonkers would be fun and it was . bonkers is a game based on asking players questions . the questions are not trivia and knowledge-based questions , but instead word-based questions . for instance , a question might ask you to `` come up with words that end in bell '' . during your turn you have 30 seconds to `` go bonkers '' trying to blurt out answers like : barbell ; dumbbell ; doorbell , cowbell etc . your goal would be to find as many answers as possible in order to hit any or all of the four answers provided on the game card . for every answer you hit , you win scoring chips . that was just one category of questions called add ons - where you find words that begin or end with a certain word . the other categories are : what the blank - where you find words to complete the blank ; rhyme time - where you find as many rhymes as possible in order to match those provided on the game card ; and letter perfect - where you would find words which begin or end with certain letters . the game play is interesting because there is some strategy thrown in . at the beginning of the round , one player ( the card reader ) peeks at the question and answers on game card and decides how many scoring chips each answer is worth . so , in the example above , the card reader might allocate 5 scoring chips to the answer cowbell , four chips to barbell , three chips to dumbell and two chips to doorbell . this is done by placing the chips on the gameboard under target answer `` a '' ; `` b '' , `` c '' or `` d '' . the object is for the card reader to decide on which answers are hardest and place the most scoring chips on the hardest answer . this is because if the players do not hit some or any of the answers provided on the game card , the card reader will win the scoring chips leftover and advance on the board . however , if the players hit all or any of the answers on the game card , they win the scoring chips for the correct answers provided . i really like the strategy part of the game , it adds a good deal of spice . bonkers provided for an entertaining evening . we will play again !
1	i originally bought this monkey on vacation . i showed it to my son and he grabbed it and hugged it . how could i not buy it for him doing that ? it was so soft and cuddly and the feet are like beany babies . i eventually ordered a 2nd one from amazon for my parents house . so now i do n't have to drag it from house to house . as he gets older , he is liking it more and more
1	people say that the iquest stinks because it does n't have all their text books . but i honestly think that even though it may be a little different , there 's no harm in learning new things .
1	my daughter received this toy for her fourth birthday . she plays with it all the time ! ! ! it did n't come with any tapes and honestly she does n't need them ! she spends quite some time speaking into the microphone and using the slide to change the sound of her voice . it is so funny ! we all get a kick out of it . there are several different sounds to choose from . even her two year old twin sisters get into the act . they love it . love this toy . it 's extremely durable . would absolutely recommend this
1	this is a fun toy , just a bit difficult to stack because of the narrow wheels . you can ask which one is biggest , what color is this car , ask about the numbers on the cars , etc ... that is why i think it is educational to that respect . my son still has this , and is three years old and will play with it every once in awhile with his matchbox cars stacking them or just rolling them along
0	this looked to be a very cool item but what we thought was a miniature picture of the item turned out to be the item itself . how they expect you to enjoy a movie on a screen the size of a thumbnail is beyond me . fun idea to be able to carry this in your pocket but not worth it
0	wish i could give this a negative . when i did finally get a sticker out , it would n't stay stuck to anything for more than five minutes . ended up sending it back to the wholesaler as unworkable and overpriced
1	my 18-month old has been playing with this for three months now and just loves it . she even knows now which color balls goes in the correct slot . she whacks them all in , puts the balls back , and keeps doing this over and over and over
0	spongebob is making an obscene gesture . personally , i do n't think it is an appropriate toy for children . anyone that thinks spongebob is merely `` pointing '' a finger should n't be so naive as to how toys are marketed and the moral decline of our society ! !
1	we live in alaska and really wanted two of these games to pass on to our married daughters since it has been a holiday tradition to play . we found them for purchase on amazon but were displeased at the cost to ship to alaska . although we are part of the us and usps ships for a reasonable price , we were n't given that option and paid at least double what it could have been . ups and fedex rip off those of us in alaska while usps treats us just like everybody in the lower-48 . give us a usps option
1	this was the webkinz my daughter wanted , and she 's been very happy with it . there was a delivery problem , but the seller from whom i bought it was a pleasure to deal wit
0	it seems like a nice complete set of playfood , except that the boxes are really flimsy cardboard , and i 've thrown most of them out already . it does n't take much to crush them . there are much nicer sets out there , and there are separate pieces sold on ebay , that are probably used but will stand the test of your kids much better . not worth the money
0	my son received this for christmas 2005 and played with it every day . the conveyor belt is noisy when running and the sponges that whirl around at the end of the car wash were constantly falling off and getting lost . after a month of being played with on a daily basis the conveyor belt stopped working - it still made plenty of noise but did n't move anymore ! when i called mattel they could n't offer me replacement parts as the toy was discontinued in 2001 ! although they gave me a voucher to buy a replacement toy , it was n't for as much as i paid for the toy .
0	i 'm not sure how this toy ended up with a 4.5 star rating after all the broken microphones ! ! ours was yet another that broke within 2 months of gentle play . it was n't thrown or dragged around by the microphone or anything of the sort . my son loved it and figured out the microphone very quickly . he loved to see the lights and the little puppy `` dance '' when he `` sang '' into the microphone . i continued to let him play with it even after the microphone shorted out and the static began and he still kept trying the microphone until he got frustrated and then i finally put it away . i wish i had spent the money on something that would have lasted longer . my son is now 18 months old and the only other toy he has ever managed to break was the vtech nursery farm which was broken 3 weeks after christmas last year , just before this piano broke . i highly recommend fisher price or leapfrog toys over vtech . we have never had a problem with their toys and 2 of the 3 vtech toys we have owned have broken on us . garbage !
0	of all of the expensive gifts i purchased for christmas , this was the one thing my daughter played with consistently . the price is right and now they have free shipping . the one bad thing is that the cards are flimsy and we wore them out !
1	i noticed that this ladybug sand box only had 3 & amp ; 1/2 stars and the others all had 5 . i felt a need to speak up . we bought this sandbox for our first son when he was three . we lived in an apartment with a small back patio . it was perfect , not too big but still room for a toddler or two to sit in it and play . he played for hours ! ! now 5 years later , his little brother loves it and my first son , almost 9 , still plays with the little one in it . it still looks brand new , nestled under the tree in our big back yard . it 's really great just smaller than the others . we have since given this for every two year old birthday present we 've bought ! i highly recommend it
0	save your money ... because if you buy these for your kids you are going to need your money for the hospital ... .they do not work like you think that would..you kid is only bouncing on big rubber bands ... and fall ever time they try to bounce ... very dangerous..they are n't made for anyone..they should be taken off the marke
0	not only do you use chocolate syrup which runs off of the cookies , pretzels , strawberries , etc. , but it does n't even warm up the syrup . so , like someone else said , you may as well fill up a bowl with hershey 's syrup and let the kids dip away . the only reason i gave this two stars instead of one is because my kids did seem to have a really good time playing with this . they thought it was great even though it was cold syrup instead of warm chocolate
0	they show a pony in the picture . but you wo n't get it , just be careful when you think you will get the dining set and the pony . if you mistakly bought it . just keep it . you will only get partial refund which is half the buying price .
1	we are huge blues clues fans and this is our favorite blue ever ! his is really big and sooooo soft ! this buddy is much more cozy than the smaller beanie baby version . he is a great , cuddly , no frills ( no buttons to push or batteries to replace ) buddy ! my toddler sons love this blue
0	we are very disappointed in this product we purchased last summer . we constantly have many kids and adults of all ages over to our house because of our swimming pool and i do n't think we have found one person who has done more than try it once then walk away . also it is difficult to find the right size to hang it becasue of different sized people using it . not recommended
1	i read some of the reviews posted on this site before i bought this doll , i saw it on ebay but was afaird because of some the comments that was posted about the doll and thought i should buy it directly in case i needed to return it , but i had no problems at all other then the ubc cord the direction said to turn the cord one way when actually it is the other way , other then that i had no problem downloading anything and i ca n't wait to give this to my daughter for easter
0	we bought this for our son for christmas this year based on glowing reviews . what a disappointment ! the `` musical instruments '' are basically glorified rattles that all sound basically the same , the song the drum plays is tinny , scratchy , and short , and nothing seems very well made . i at least expected the different instruments to sound different from one another . on the plus side , it is cute , and the lobster has a pretty wind chime like sound
0	i bought this as a gift for my nephew . unfortunately it did n't work when it arrived , but fortunately my sister in law was able to take it to a local discovery store and exchange it for one that worked fine
1	when i was a little girl i stood along beside the table and watched the adults play . this was how i learned how to play the game . i have now been playing rook for about eight years and loved the style of cards shown above ( 90 's style ) . unfortunately , they have changed the style of the cards on us and i would like to purchase the 90 's style . if any come availible to purchase please be sure to email me and inform me of this so that i can buy some . i really dislike the new style of cards and all of my friends and family agree with me
0	my 5-1/2 year old son received this for christmas . he loves pirates and legos , so it seemed a perfect fit . we were wrong ! the mega bloks are poorly made , and it 's very difficult ( even for an adult ) to get the pieces to stay together . imagine how frustrating this is for a child ... ..we will never purchase mega bloks products again , we 're sticking to the original legos ! nothing more satisfying than spending money on a gift that makes your child scream and cry in frustration ... thanks megabloks
1	i love this doll i only saw her in the store and when i did i fell in love with her i cant wait to get her ! but i do think its a bit pricey but its worth the money
1	it is fun ! and most importantly educational . it has a game where you have to put the exact amount of money in the game slot . my kids like that part . they are 6 and 7 and ask me all the time if they can play their spongebob game , we are a two leapster family but they have to share their cartridges . next year my youngest will want one too , i am sure , as she wants to play theirs , but she is just too little yet , another year she will be 4 so will check into getting her one of her own then..
0	my son received this as a birthday gift and it broke the 2nd time that he played with it . while i was putting it on him the plastic belt just snapped in half . luckily we had a different belt from another toy that we could use with the gadgets . the previous reviewer was right about the difficulty of taking the gadgets on and off . there 's no way that my 4 year old son could do it without my help . if i had the receipt i would have returned it
0	the pieces were very tiny and the sticker flags kept popping off the plastic . my daughter 's favorite part was the pink and white horse with the carriage , which she promptly took over and put with her dollhouse . after asking santa for a cinderella castle she was a bit disappointed . this playset would probably be fine for a child who was just going to set it up and not play with it
1	my 3 year old son plays with them all the time . they are a little challenging and he loves to see the completed puzzle . the box is great and keeps the puzzles separate . each puzzle peice is marked on the back for easy sorting . i am ordering all of the boxed sets asap
1	my daughter had a 12 dancing princess party and she loved the game . it 's a little tricky for her to do the set up , but she enjoys playing it
1	this is a toy that my son always wants to play with and we 've had this dinosaur for quite a while now . usually , we buy our son a toy that he pleads for ( he likes it soooooo much ) and it looks like fun but then it ends up in the back of his closet after a few days of playing with it . this brontosaurus makes a booming sound with his feet when you pull a trigger underneath which both my sons love ( 4 2 ) and the included figures are great . this toy stands up to the brutual tug of war that accompanies our two small boys and it is quite the bargain at the price . i highly recommend all of the dinosaurs and cavemen in this series . not only does it keep my sons busy ( oh yeah ) but it also helps built their imagination as i hear them tell each other all these stories about their dinosaurs . imaginext has even come out with `` new '' dinosaurs in this line which can be found at target or other stores ( i have found that tru has a limited selection ) .
0	in order to answer the questions in this edition of trivial pursuit you would need an encyclopedic knowledge of the minutae of snl . most of the questions were beyond the ability of my family , who have watched snl since it began , and who quote it frequently . i was very disappointed in this game .
1	we were very pleased with the service we received . our purchases were shipped in a timely fashion and came in good condition
1	my 2.5 year old border collie just loves the tunnel and we train with it a few times per week . since the agility tunnels for dogs are a bit pricey , i decided to try this more affordable kid 's tunnel instead . it 's not as heavy and robust as the official agility tunnels , but it has been serving me great for just about a year - there 's just some minor wearing around the rings and small toe nail runs in it - but it 's still very usable . my ratings would change a bit for kids though - probably a 3 for educational and 5 for durability
1	this is a fun toy for anyone who is a starwars and mr . potato head fan
0	i thought the art had a certain charm , and used strictly as a picture book for children who ca n't yet read , i think it 's quite nice . ( too bad you ca n't make up your own story to go with it . ) the moment the child starts to read , though -- better hide it quick , because ... unfortunately , the book reads like a condensed communist manifesto for kids ( as others have noted ) , or a socialist agenda primer . i do n't know for sure that 's what marcus pfister had as an aim , and i 'm not going to speculate on his politics . he has three kids and may raise them as he likes , and indulge in any such philosophical musings as float his boat . yes , i suppose sharing is nice . certainly sharing one 's talents and abilities for the betterment of others is a great thing -- but in america , we get paid for that ( charity is voluntary , not coerced ) . furthermore , stripping yourself of what makes you unique and interesting ( not necessarily better , just unique and interesting ) , or giving away all your possessions , is a lousy way to make and keep friends , is n't it ? is this book implying that somehow friendship can only be obtained by placating envy ( a negative personal quality that should be dealt with by self-examination and intent to change , not pandering ) ? is it saying that being interesting and having unique qualities is bad ? almost seems like it , at least to me . furthermore , there 's an overtone of `` only by belonging to a group can you have self-worth , '' which is as hoary a case of balderdash as ever i 've seen . of course , people who agree with that egregious sentiment will disagree with me , but that wo n't make them right . ( the two stars , if you must know , are for the art .
0	the pictures get jammed in the camera and are very hard to remove . one picture got stuck in there and so this toy was broken after about 2 days of play
1	the checkbook package was opened . no pieces were missing . but it was hard to glue the plastic to the cardboard to give it as a christmas gift
0	what a disappointment ! the music quality is very poor -- most of the `` intruments '' sound just like every other cheap kids electronic toy . the piano is probably the worst ; the animal voices all sound the same . i thought i 'd get better quality at the price , plus , the left speaker does n't work . my kids had a toy casio keyboard that cost $ 12.00 and was the size of an egg-carton , and its sound was vastly superior . i will likely have to go through the hassle of returning this .
0	we received this as a gift and did n't like it at all . my two year old used it for about a day . but it does n't go very far with the remote ( you ca n't just have it move across the floor ) and it 's very noisy ! if it is walked away from you can hear it in the other room still making an annoying noise . i 'd go with something else if you 're looking for a first remote control ca
0	i just recieved a fisher price magazine in the mail and thought this product would be a nice christmas gift . i was thinking that amazon would have a good price , but they are almost double what fisher price is asking . if you go to fisher price 's website this item is only $ 33.00 + $ 7.95 shipping and handling .
0	my daughters are a little young for this toy and are n't that into it yet . it is very cute , with lots of sweet , tiny , realistic pieces , and i can see it having lots of play value and somewhat educational . however , they made it so the arms are jointed in order that she can hold the baby . well , my daughter threw the doll on the floor at the doctor 's office and the bottom half of the arm fell right off . even if it had n't broken , you have to place the arms just right or they look totally strange . this is the least favorite barbie my girls own . if it were n't for the arms , this would be a great toy . oh , and the back of the dresser is open , so you ca n't really store the small pieces in it . not sure why they did n't just close it up to make storage easier .
0	this sudoku yd-638 puzzle is very hard to use . and i think of my self as a computer geek . to make matters worse the instructions are very poor . they may make sense to someone who has used this for years , but not to a new user . save you money to buy a different game .
0	i bought this game for my new family for christmas . this is not at all the game of life that i remember playing for countless hours as a child . first of all , my old game had all of the mountains , houses , and spinner permenantly attached to the game board . with the new version , all of these things have to be attached with each setup , which takes about 10-15 minutes and they are easily knocked off the board . also , the spinner is hard to spin and frequently comes off of its pivot . the cars are less sturdy and the people pegs do not stay in the car so you are constantly having to put the people back in the car . finally , the rules of the game have gotten more complicated and yet the meaning of the game has become more trivial . i think i will put this in the top of a closet or in a yard sale and go find my old version of the game to play in the future
0	my 2 year old son loves to `` cook '' and to serve mommy and daddy meals from his kitchen . my only complaint is that it falls over easily and it seems we are often picking it up off the floor . it is n't very sturdy , but i 'm not unhappy with this purchase
0	this toy is great fun but it is n't very durable . ours broke after about an hour . there was a loud pop and then it stopped erupting . i guess the plastic bladder must have given out . the kids were terribly disappointed
1	i 've enjoyed playing this game with people from around the world- it seems to work best with a group of people who have n't been hanging out together since childhood . it gets people talking and makes for an evening of all sorts of interesting stories- and you get to find out what interesting people your friends are
1	my son turned 4 on tuesday and i had bought this and was saving it as a birthday gift ! he absolutely loves it ! he has spent hours and hours of time already sitting and playing with this playset and his turtles . even my husband thinks it 's cool ! it was n't too difficult to put together and it stays together quite nicely ! great toy for a 4 year old that loves tnmt
1	i recently bought these 4 little dora dolls for my 4 yr old 's birthday . she really loves them . she plays with them all the time . it is a nice collection to her dora stash !
0	i ordered two soccer ball kits for my two young sons . they were unable to inflate either soccer ball on christmas day because neither of the accompanying pumps and needles worked . if there had been no accompanying pump and needle with each kit , i would have been better prepared ahead of time to have my own pump ready . i had to go out and buy new needles the day after christmas . we 'll try again another day to see if we can inflate the balls with a different pump
1	my 4 1/2 year old recieved this red engine last christmas , and for the first couple of months was used practically every day . ( and yes , i agree with the rest of the reviewers- buy rechargable batteries since this engine eats them , and prepare to be disappointed since it can not pull many cars up the hills without getting stuck . ) i will tell you that i can not believe my son has not touched this engine since . his complaint is that all it does is go around and around . instead , he enjoys playing out stories from thomas , or making up his own train sagas . my husband likes to watch the engine more than my son . i do n't know how other children play with their trains , but the battery operated engines just can not hold his attention for very long . nevertheless , for the first few months , watching it is really mesmerizing , i could watch it for hours . perhaps instead of buying this one engine , purchase a setup with more cars and track for the same money . it will probably get more use in the end
0	i did not buy this from amazon but sought it out here so i could vent about this outrageous product ( that 's 'outrageous ' in its traditional meaning , that it outrages me ) . this is two packets of colored dust , approximately the consistency of unmixed plaster . empty the plastic bags and the colored dust flies everywhere , mold it in your hand and it retains its shape for a few seconds before blurring and falling apart . my wife and i repeatedly checked the packaging to see if we should add water or do something else to make this usable but apparently not . the claim on the package is that it `` molds like dough , '' obviously intended to remind us of play-doh , but play-doh is a clay-like material that retains its shape and can , in fact , be molded . this material -- again attempting to compare itself to play-doh -- states that it wo n't dry out . of course not ! it 's dust ! it ca n't dry out , there 's nothing drier than dust . in case you 're wondering i have no connection to play-doh or its makers ( i do n't even know who does make it ) , i 'm simply the father of a 3-year old who uses play-doh often and hoped this product might be a workable addition to our playtime . wrong
1	well the space is limated but i learned how to deal with it . the set comes with four parts rainforestchamber , bug chamber , aquarium , and ant colony . the aquarium comes with triop eggs or you can put a goldfish in . then we have ant colony which the air holes are a bit to big . finally we have rain and bug chamber which to me are the best of all the four . the rain forest chamber can hold a small lizard or frog but since i bought this during winter i will have to wait till spring to catch a lizard . and we all know what you put in a bug chamber . over all i rate this four stars due to small space . p.s there a bug catcher in it as well
1	everything was great ! great bed , easy to assemble , my son loves it . though he still wants to sleep in my bed , but he does play in it , that 's a good sign , huh
0	my two year old absolutely would not leave the store without this and she still plays with it a year later . however , there are two problems . one , it immediately needed repair to the basic connections and , two , it has a pinching hazard between the basket and the frame . but of course , my daughter never noticed either of those . she simply loves to play with it , constantly , and has to take it on walks around the block
1	the x-23 figure availible on amazon.com is dressed in purple but there also is a black one - a variant that is alot harder to find [ i resorted to ebay for mine ] . the build of the figure is great - there 's so much articulation , it 's insane ; and her feet claws actually tuck under her shoes so they can be concealed which is beyond cool . the articulation , for the most part , is great . my only qualm with it is it makes her arms look funny but i can deal with that . she 's barely 6 inches tall , i do n't expect her to be perfect . however , the reason i 'm giving her three stars is because i feel the purple outfitted one is far inferior to the black outfitted x. i recieved my black clad x-23 first and expected the same figure but in a purple for my other one but i was wrong . the black x-23 has very dark brown hair that lays straight and lank while the purple x-23 's hair is jet black and windblown which makes her head almost impossible to move around . also , the thing that bothers me the most is that x 's eyes are green on the black suited version but on the purple suited version , they 're orange . i am a big x-23 fan and i understand that when she 's `` triggered '' , her eyes go crazy reddish orange , but that 's not something i really want to see sitting on top of my computer monitor . it 's kind of creepy ! and on a sidenote , when did x-23 wear purple ? in her comics she was either in black , dressed as a civilain or in the old wolverine costume [ which you can see in the comic that comes with x-23 ] . i would 've prefered a variant wearing the wolverine costume while the black x-23 was mass produced . so , personally , i would recommend hunting down the variant of x-23 for your collection . she looks nicer and , i think , is more true to the character
0	it wroke 2 minutes later after openning , my husbund try to fixed but surprice all the inside partes are `` plastic '' you can`t fixed . do not waist your money
0	it did n't even last 24 hours before it split at the seams in several different spots . do n't waste your money
1	these dominos are great for the hello kitty lover . my six year old loves them . do n't be fooled by the picture though , the tin is not full . if you ask me , there are not enough of them in there . the tin is filled about three quarters with plastic to hold the dominoes up in the window and make it look full . i would have rated it five stars if it had been full
1	very complete with a lot of things to play for hours . my daughter still plays with it , and she is now four years old . definitely it was worth it . highly recommended
0	i purchased this item for my son 's birthday . not well built as it needed lots of tape to keep it together and readjustments after each attempt to fly it . also appears to need the wind just right and thrown a certain way in order for it to fly . after a couple of days we were able to accomplish only one 2 min . successful flight . on the second day , after 15 mins of recharging the battery , the battery case and wires melted . have contacted company for a refund .
1	another nice product from playdough . worth the ten bucks or so.. we just bought this from amazon . this would make a cute birthday present for a young child , say 2 to 8 ? hard to give an age as i myself like to sit with my son and play ! enough play dough for the price and the bucket is really handy for storage . i would buy this again as a gift
1	my daughter got this for her 6th birthday . she absolutely loves it , as does her 3 year old sister . one of them is using it all the time . the 3 different tops on the wand are a little frustrating for my 3 year old , as she ca n't switch them out herself and comes running to have someone else switch the tops for her . my 6 year old has caught onto all of the dance moves and is able to do them along with the dvd . my 3 year old ca n't do them all , but she has a great time just doing what she can . both of my girls love cinderella , so they put on their dress up cinderella dresses whenever they do the dvd . i wish there was a way to order just an extra mat , though , so they could do the dvd together instead of fighting over who gets to stand on the mat
0	purchased five of these sets thinking they would be fun stocking stuffers . wanting to check out what i purchased , i opened one of the five . the geodes are tiny ( not as pictured ) . it was like breaking open dirt-clods ... that have a small empty space inside ... but not crystals . maybe it was a `` dud '' box , but will probably be returning the other four .
0	i recently purchased this item for my daughter who has been wanting to paint . i thought this would be great because the paint is in the brush and it wo n't be messy . although all this is true , both of us found it very frustrating that it was difficult to get out of the tube . if this is made for children , should n't it be easier to use and should an adult really have trouble with it
1	it was the most popular gift on his first birthday . he loved pushing it , sitting on it and moving the small animal figures . lots of different kinds of fun for him
0	most of the other reviews for this toy are correct . when it works my kids love it . and it is pretty cool when it works . but it does n't work very well very often . you need to find just the right car and everything needs to line up exactly . and even then the car crashes a lot . we have found one car ( out of about 200 ) that works somewhat well . but even with this car the success rate is about 1 in 15. so , read the reviews and make your own judgements . personally , i 'm glad this was a gift and i did not spend any money on it . my kids will still play with and enjoy it , but not as much as they would if it worked better
1	this is the first rc ( radio control ) aircraft i have ever flown , although i have raced rc cars for quite awhile . it comes fully assembled with a nice manual and even a quick intro dvd to get you in the air quickly . i started out in my living room and it has worked just great . with just a little trimming out the heli is very stable and easy for which to get a feel . i 've run it for a few hours now with no incidents and i 'm getting pretty good at hovering although i still have a tough time with head-in flight ( controls thus reversed ) . the blade cx rtf makes a great first heli or just a great indoor heli . probably fine for anyone over 10 years old . i am getting 10-15 minutes of flight time on a battery charge . the only disappointment is that charging a battery takes 60-90 minutes ( typical with all lipo batteries ) . i 'd recommend getting an extra battery or two and maybe even an extra powersupply and charger . also i have tried the training gear add-on for the blade cp/cp pro -- it fits the cx just fine and allows you to use it later if you move on -- and it helps with damage but makes the blade cx slightly less stable in hover in my opinion but not terribly so . they 're probably worth the trade off at first . in a few more hours i think i 'll be ready to move up to the blade cp pro . highly recommended for anyone interested in entering rc helicopters or who just wants a heli to fly around the house . two good sites for further info are [ ... ]
0	unless you are prepared to be constantly putting the ropes and the masts back on the ship , this toy is a complete waste of money . my son had been wanting the black pearl for quite some time and this was a huge disappointment to him . buyer beware
1	love this new edition to yatzee . it is so handy to have the tray so your dice do n't go flying everywhere . this game is really a good game for the whole family
1	my grandson has truly enjoyed the easyscore basketball set from the first day he tried it . wonderful to have the adjustment for heightening as he grows .
0	my husband and i just bought the family feud 2nd edition dvd tv games . i have to say we both loved this game when it was first on ( and on gsn as repeats ) and i like the computer version . we played this once by ourself and a couple of times with friends and we all have found that this game was boring as someone said they ca n't believe they put this out . if you are going to get this game then buy the computer version . you have 5 rounds round # 1 round # 2 double money round triple money round fast money round you have team a and team b . if you get one wrong answer and you click wrong then it says go for steal . however , you only get one x . per guide ... if an answer is revealed that team a did not have written down , they press wrong answer button and pass the remote to team b . team b now has the opportunity to steal the round . so most of the game was passing the remote back and forth . if the steal answer matches any one of the remaining answers they steal the round ( even if you-team a had that written down ) and takes the money for any answer the other team has answered correctly ( even if they got 4 out of 5 and both teams say have the same answer ) the game itself was simple and basic . there was no real fun to it . we tried to play it with others and they said afterwards that they found it boring and not all that fun . one person said they would have more fun watching the game itself on tv over playing this version of the game . you get two markers ( red and blue ) to write on the two wipe-clean score cards . the negative on this is that the markers do not write all that good on these cards even though they were meant to . another thing is that the same game will come up more than once . we had the same question and answer come up even though we only played twice . this is the 3rd or 4th dvd game we have been given or bought . this is the only one where we disliked it so much after playing it a couple of times that we are giving it away as we will not be playing it again
1	my son loves the imaginext dino collection . he has almost all of them . they 're durable , fun and educational
0	a one star rating for this toy is way to charitable . the car does nothing but jerk , and thats only when repeatedly hitting the button . disney should be a shame of themselves for marketing this toy ! surely they had to have an idea about their product 's poor performance . my advice is everyone should print off the reviews from amazon and all like it . with this in hand , march into disney stores and demand ( 1 ) their money back ( 2 ) an apology . the only thing less reliable than this was my 1991 gmc jimmy
0	i bought this for my son 's first birthday . he loved it ! but , after only a month it stopped quacking and he lost most interest in it . he still plays with it a little bit , but not like when it made noise . i would n't have wasted my money if i had known the batteries would only last a month
0	the canopy bar broke only two days after christmas . now i have a sharp end on the bed frame . not good for little fingers . for the price , i thought it would have been a lot more sturdy
0	my 7 year old saw the ads for digidraw and drove me absolutely crazy until christmas rolled around last year . the look of excitement and happiness on his face as he unwrapped this toy was short-lived . it was nearly impossible to assemble . the time and patience it required to 'trace ' just a straight line was too much for an adult let alone a 7 year old . the only useable item from this entire toy were the colored pencils
1	i purchased this for my daughter a bit before christmas and she loves it . it is a great item for the price and does what the bigger brand names does . thank you
0	what a co-incidence , my first 3d puzzle too . average difficulty for the average user . would not recommend it for the beginner . the panels are not hard to put together , but it is fiddly putting all the panels together . once done , the model is quite magnifique . and got me started on 3d puzzles . hasbro/wrebbit should give everyone 1 free 3d puzzle , then everyone would get hooked on it . none of the 3d puzzles can stand a lot of handling , however this eiffel tower actually survived a show and tell . sadly it now rests in 3 pieces and i 'm too lazy to put it back together again . highly recommended
1	this shopping cart is the perfect height for my daughter . my two boys even love to use it to cart around their cars and blocks ! highly recommended
1	breyer makes such authentic lifelike replicas of the worlds most beautiful horses . my daughter is in horse heaven . the detail is so accurate that my daughter noticed even the footpad of the horses were unique to each one
1	i got this for my 5 year old , who started kindergarten this fall , and she is in love with the whole school concept . she loves to pretend to be the teacher with this playset . her friend came over one day and played with it , too , and they took turns being the student and teacher . i ended up buying another set for her friend 's birthday .
1	i do n't agree with the other review this doll is great to play with . she has such a pretty dress and vail . her hair is very long and it get tangled pretty easy but if your good with barbie hair its not a problem . i would suggest that you buy the groom at the same time take it from me i still really want him . the barbie with blond hair is also very pretty
1	ms. pac man was always my game back in the day . she just seemed less clunky than her male predecessor . i just received this game in the mail today and after a mad scramble for eight ( count 'em eight ) aa batteries i got down to business . i admit that i bought this game for ms. pac man , exclusively . here 's what i found , in a nutshell : pros : 1 ) graphics sound are faithful to the old arcade game with the minor exception of the placement of the score , lives and fruit . no problem . 2 ) old skool joystick . nice touch . 3 ) plug 'n play set-up . no brainer . cons : 1 ) i honestly do n't mind cords one bit . the eight batteries can be a bit of a logistical problem as i do n't usually have a dozen-or-so batteries lying around at any given time . 2 ) my main gripe is that the joystick is frustratingly unresponsive and has the habit of moving ms. pac in directions i do n't want her to go . i understand , however , that the previous version of this game was worse in this regard and has been slightly improved in this version . fair 'nuff . all-in-all a neat little contraption that is every bit as addictive as it was in my youth .
1	my son loves this game . when moving around the tracks , in the one game it can be difficult , the key is if you moving up or down , depending on which direction you need to go , push the joystick the direction once and let go , after that push the joystick the direction the train needs to go . i hope this helps . my son will be 3 in less then a month and it took him a week to figure out how to move around the tracks . mom , dad and sis had to play before that . the other games are a little easier , but i found the games educational and my son loves it
0	my 11 yr old thought this was amazing but the maneuver wheels on the bottom will only run over hard surfaces and not carpet which was ok with us . he did , however , run it over carpet and the traction wheel rubber pully snapped . the legs are also quite fragile and after only 2 days of play , one of the legs broke . because of that , the spider can not `` walk '' now ! too bad because its looks great . we are going to send it back .
0	anxiously awaited this very expensive box of cards mostly for the special insert cards but there was only the autograph card and no memorabilia card . you can not realize the disappointment one feels when this happens . you look and look , searching through the wrappers and identify each card hoping that you missed it somehow , but no . no memorabilia card as promised right on the box and in all advertised articles . of course , the topps company does n't have a website for me to complain to but this did turn out to be a surefire way to find another hobby ! thanks .
0	we used the machine once , and were disappointed by the performance . the second time that we attempted to use it , it would n't heat . after contacting roseart , i was told that i could ship it to them at my expense for a replacement . i will probably not bother , as it was a lousy product to begin with .
1	i love this nativity even though it i think it is pricey . there are no other ones like it . they are fisher price little people so you know they will hold up forever ! there are n't any other plastic nativity sets out there . get the set that plays the song when you place the angel on top of the stable . it is so worth the price when you know they will play with it every year . i even take this to church when i teach my 3and4yr old class about jesus birth . they love it
0	when we bought this , i liked the versatility it offered . i quickly noticed , however , that it is mostly good for strewing the soft pieces everywhere . there are actually too many pieces to keep up with , and frankly i 'm getting sick of stepping on the cow . my 6 mos old likes it for a couple minutes , until he 's rolled away from it . my 3 year old thinks it 's interesting , but she just ends up taking it apart and the pieces end up all over the place . after a couple days of playing with it i usually put most of it away and keep out only a couple parts to complement our other toys . the water play mat lasted until my 3 year old stepped on it once or twice . then that was gone
1	my nephew loves this gift . in fact , he would n't allow his sister to play with it , so now she also has one
1	my toddler and all of her friends love this play house . it is great , no assembly required
1	i purchased the parents magazine version first and my one year old son did n't play with it much but after watching him go crazy at a friends house with this hasbro toy i purchased it and he has been playing with it ever since . the buttons are placed in such a way that he can hold it with both hands and press buttons at the same time . he also enjoys teething on the keys . i highly recommend this product for mothers who want to hold on to their own keys
1	my kids grew up overseas and are quite familiar with renaissance paintings . they 've seen many of these paintings and are very familiar with them . i realize this is not the typical situation . i was disappointed that the game is basically a game of luck . it is not challenging or reinforcing of our kid 's knowledge . i had hoped for a game like `` famous authors '' which builds on and tests the level of knowledge of the players . nonetheless , the game is well presented . it 's on the expensive side , but the book alone is worth half the price . looking for a fancy gift with cultural overtones ? i recommend this
0	i have a big dora fan in my house this was one of her first dora dolls ( last year ) . she played with it for the first day or two ... its loud , very mechanical , not very appealing . the toy saw a rebirth in use when it was discovered that it she could make dora dance terrorize the puppy . the doll only does one dance , regardless of what skirt she has on now . from reading other reviews , if i pushed held it while she was wearing it she might ballet , but not worth the hassle ! since then , my dora lover has received various other dora dolls , so we have a collection that sings , dances , speaks various languages , and the only one she plays with regularly is the dress up adventure dora - she 's more posable , does something other than sing , and you can change her outfits . perfect for my almost 5 year old
0	i bought this identical bed at toys r us for $ 175.00 . this person is ripping people off , do your shopping before paying their mark up and shipping costs
0	i was very unhappy with this product because the paint is chipping off the wood side-boards which is very dangerous for kids . i was wondering if there was it possible for me to get new side boards for my grandson 's wagon which i purchased for his 2nd birthday . he is unable to play with the wagon because of the paint chipping off
1	my son got these blocks when he was 2 for christmas . he is now 4 and 1/2 and still playing with them . it seems no matter what new toy he has gotten , every morning i hear him carrying out his bucket of these megabloks . i only wish they came is a larger quantity .
1	love it ! the questions are great ... the `` party mode '' is great entertainment
1	two grandsons ( 4 years and 6 years ) have truly enjoyed this cartridge . recommend it highly !
1	i bought this set for my three children 5,4,2 last christmas at a fancy toy store . this product is top of the line and my kids can not get enough of this . the marble runs are easy to build , sturdy and so much for them to play with . there are a variety to build with the more advanced sets also we bought a few more `` fun '' and cool looking marbles as they raced them down . the kids can change out the different blocks to make the marbles react in different ways- which is a creative aspect . i love this toy ! ! ! ! my kids beg me to make them a new marble run all the time . you do need a hard surface to build on , since we did n't have a `` train table '' we put it on a hard piece of cardboard so it laid flat on the carpet , that way you do n't have to hear the clink-clink of the marbles as they hit the bottom..
1	fisher-price is bringing back old time well-made toy construction with their peek a blocks ! i have 4 kids who are 5 and under , and i have to say that they all get use out of these blocks ! if you love peek a blocks , please feel free to join my peek a blocks group at yahoo groups : http : //groups.yahoo.com/group/fisherpricepeekablocks/ it is completely free and we have been having some interesting discussions on there about unknown secrets of peek a blocks !
0	i recieved this itema s a gift . i thought it would be great i was wrong ! the designs it gives you are really cool but the ploish that comes with this is awful ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1	her favorite toy ... she loves the microphone ... keys light up to prompt her to press the keys and play a song ... . this thing is great
1	i purchased this for my son @ babies r us only because i had a gift card ... but i dont regret it at all ... this is one of kristobals ' favorite toys from the peek a block collection ! my oldest son enjoys it also ! not bad for 20bu
0	i bought this as a christmas present for my 4-year-old daughter . she is a huge my little pony fan . ponyville lives in our house in fact . we got it out and played with it for a couple hours . we did n't have the problems described with the hand crank . that seems to be very durable . the problem is with the flower that zippee goes in . a pony steps on the flower to open the flower and then you wind the gear counter clockwise to close it . after a couple hours , the flower petals are now broken and ca n't be repaired . toys certainly do n't have the quality in them that they used to . hasbro 's quality in general has declined . this was demonstrated in the newest my little pony castle as well . this toy has some neat features . the crank works well and the braiding mechanism is useful . the breezie that lives in the flower goes along with the story in the my little pony video series . the colors are vivid and bright . i would have liked to suggest that the pink stage that the daffidazey stands on should have had built-in storage to hold the hair accessories . some additional clips would also have been a nice addition to this set . 4 clips for a set that is designed to do all your ponies ' hair is a bit skimpy . the braids are nice and tight and even a young child can operate this toy ... .with a bit of assistance . ( hint : putting suction cups or velcro hook and loop on the bottom makes it even easier for little ones to play with minimal adult assistance )
0	my 4 year son is learning about the fragility of life the hard way with this tank . two goldfish , two flushes . if i take the struggling fish out of the tank and put it in a fish bowl it seems to come around , but they wo n't last 24 hours in this tank . i 've followed the directions to a t , adjusted the ph , tried lights on lights off , pump on pump off , even used bottled water , but the fish just do a slow fade when in the tank
0	this toy was a huge disappointment for me . my boys took one look at it and threw it . i thought it was much bigger than what it is . i was also upset that i spent as much as i did and it was n't even a decent size . my boys are moving to a car themed room and it just was n't what i envisioned . it also only says one thing which can be quite boring for small children
0	my 3 year old has 8 vsmile games and this is his least favorite . his top 2 favorite is toy story and winnie the pooh
0	i was very disappointed with the quality of this product . i had to request a second kit because the scented oils bottles were empty in the first kit . the second kit also had the same problem . both kits had to be returned . it is difficult to determine how fun this kit would be when it is missing items within the kit
1	ok so my son got it for christmas and here it is june and i just hooked it up . it took me all of 5 mintutes not even that to program it . the first try # 4 wouldnt take so what i did is i put the toy remote on one thigh and the remote on the other so that there were almost touching and so that the `` eyes '' were right on top of each other . and it took straight away . its really fun for my 4 year old my 10 year old got bored . my only suggestion is that there needs to be a bigger choice of games . they are so similar that my 4 year old changes games quite a bit . i am actually having trouble finding games for it now . its great and if they are going to be in front of the tv might as well be learning . he also hase vsmile which is a little bit better if you can afford the 60 $ for the game unit and 20 $ for the games . ( grandma and grandpa got ours for us with games ) so it wasnt bad for us . read with me dvd is good though , i really enjoy playing it and listening to the stories
1	our family played this game a lot during the 60 's . we had a blast with it . i did n't think much about it until this year when my son turned 6 . it 's a blast for family fun
1	there are always problems with an any type of bed , even an inflatable one . i am actually 21 , but i do n't have a credit card so i had to use the kid review instead . this bed is great . of course there are problems , but they do n't outweigh the good that the bed has . it is great to sleep on , you can carry it on trips , you can have it on another bed that is in one place , or on the floor . i do admit , it is somewhat hard to set up , but it is worth the effort , for the sleep is unparralleled . i sleep on it every night and i have had no problems with it at all . i recomend this bed to be for ages 5 to adult because of the gap it has between the side and the mattress . what is the most important thing of all is this : is the person you bought it for happy with it
0	there is no magic in this wand . what appeared to be a thin wooden malfoy 's wand , turned out to be a poor replica made of plastic . my son was very disappointed . he used his own hard earned money to purchase this item
0	i thought this toy looked fantastic as i was searching for developmental toys to help in various areas while they grew . the versitility of this one looks great . well , i liked it more than either one of my children did , as they almost never played with it except for the simple joy of taking it apart and strewing it all over the playroom ! the black and white face was good when they are first starting to be attracted to faces but other than that , it just got taken apart and lost its interest , no matter which way i arranged the peices . infants would do much better with a flat playmat with a mobile suspended above their heads
1	my son received these when he was 7 months old and we are loving them ! they 're adorable and chunky and work great on carpets or hard floors . they 're easy for little hands to hold on to and a couple of them rattle . when my nephews come over they always find these -- and they 're 5 and 7
1	i got this for my 2 year old for christmas . it was a nice present , he enjoys it . 2 things though , it only came with 75 smaller balls so i had to purchase another 100 from somewhere else and the picture is misleading as to how big the item actually is . it could fit 2 toddlers in the pit itself and that would be max , and that is two 2-3 year olds . it is comparable though to other ball pits in size and he seems to enjoy the hoop and putting the ball through the hole in big bird 's ice cream cone so i feel it was worth the money , especially since i did n't pay for shipping
0	i bought two of these trikes for my 19 month old twin sons . within the first 10 minutes of use , they both tipped over numerous times . they tipped over when they were trying to use the pedals and also when they were just using their feet on the floor . definitely not a sturdy trike . my husband and i were very disappointed and returned them immediately . in reading other reviews , i see that our experience with these trikes is not unique
0	i bought this for my 6 year old after christmas as her cousin received one and loved it . i ran all over town trying to find the pvd 's ( which are hard to find a good selection of ) . i ended up purchasing some online . by the time the pvd 's arrived , the player was no longer working . we have replaced the batteries several times . on a rare occasion , it will turn on , but that is very rare . we are very disappointed with this unit . i should have listened to my husband and bought the dvd player !
0	this suduko handheld game was not user friendly . i returned it for a full refund
1	my 28 month old son got this puzzle for christmas and loves it . he put it together the first time out of the box himself . it is the first thing he does every morning and then several times a day . my almost 5 year old likes it too . it is not as sturdy as the melissa doug floor puzzles , but it still really sturdy .
0	my daughter wanted this for christmas more than anything . but the doll is very difficult to use . suzie has these sudden shutdowns where she turns off for no apparent reason . then suddenly she 'll come back to life later . she `` grows '' almost instantly . despite my best efforts to try and protect the grow button . i reset her constantly . getting her to do all of the fun `` big girl '' things she is suppossed to do is frustrating for my five year old . essentially , i have spent more time fiddling with suzie than my daughter has spent playing with her . and the face paint came off almost immediately . even with the small amount of time that she has been working . perhaps when my daugter is a little older , she can spend time fiddling with her . she does play with her as just a `` baby doll '' so it has n't been a total waste . but i certainly did n't need to spend the extra money for all of the electronics that do n't work . oh , and sometimes i 'll walk into my daughters room and she 'll suddenly `` wake up '' and start saying mama . very horror movieish .
1	i loved this trike ! it was given to my son for his first birthday and he loved it . daycare was in walking distance ( i lived in the city ) and i used the trike to take him . my son loved to hold onto the handle bars , it gave him a sence of freedom from the stroller that he hated . my son is now three years old and i am buying a new one for my one year old . i understand some people give this product bad reviews but there is a 1-800 number that goes with the toy . the brand radio flyer is well known and the customer service line is very helpful and willing to replace parts or defects . this is the only gift that was given to my son that i can say `` i love '' and have had for more than just one year ! enjoy
1	my son is a very active 2 yr old and very hard on toys , and these are great . thick plastic construction . easy enough for him to hook them up himself . we have 2 different kinds and they are both super
1	if your child likes the wiggles like my 2 year-old does , then she 'll love this keyboard . except that there is no volume button , which i consider rude to the parents . :
0	my 3 yr old son received this toy last year for christmas and was so excited . in less than a week , one of the rear wheels cracked in half , rendering it a non-returnable piece of junk
1	i bought her and veronica too ! i love to them ! ! i play archie and date them..they are my fun girls ! ! my wife likes them too
0	we got this set for my 4 year old son for christmas . his eyes lit up when he saw it . he dropped everything and insisted that we open it right away ... .we did n't , of course ... we waited a whole day ... thank goodness ... it literally took an hour to put together . there are so many pieces that look alike but are barely different . it was very frustrating ... then it would n't stay together once it was finished . it has been nothing but a frustration for him and me ever since . he gets so upset when he tries to play with it . we saved the box . it 's going back , if they will take it ...
0	big disappointment . cheaply made . t-rex model does not snap together , can not even fit together as parts are improperly molded . microscope less functional than a magnifying lens . volcano is ok , the plaster does work , but you must provide ingredients for the eruption . weather center very very flimsy and breaks . i was quite surprised a name like smithsonian would be associated with this low of quality in a product . supplies for crystals subpar for what is required . was an enormous disapointment after the holidays for my sons .
0	it makes cotton candy in 30 minutes because it has to warm for 10 minutes then it have to put put the suger in the middle then wait til becomes webby then wait agian to turn it off . parents this machine dose n't work only made with suger thats all it is and also it takes forever ? think before you buy your children will get cavities you will also spend your money on this instead of food or other need
1	i 've been wanting this forever and when i got it , it was totally awsome ! ! first it comes with a really , really cool chair ( that you are going to love ! ) , it also comes with a sweet guitar with amp ( fyi . the amp has some really cool stickers on it ) and it also includes two ( 2 ) guitar magazines . i truly love this piece mainly because i 've always wanted an amp for my guitars . oh , i highly , highly recommend this you 'll love it ! well hope this helps . : )
0	good luck getting this bed ! i ordered it 5 months ago ( with availability being 2-4 weeks . each month i was told it will available `` next month . '' i finally cancelled my order and purchased the little tykes one before my frustrated 3 yr. old outgrows a toddler bed . kidkraft needs to focus more on actually manufacturing their products and less on marketing for orders they are unable to fulfill
0	we were excited to give this to our 5 year old for his birthday . after opening he loved the design and having his own cool looking notebook computer and was very excitied . however the screen is very disappointing . i ca n't even rate the games because overall i simply just ca n't see what is on it . the product is relatively useless in a dark environment and dissapointing . i should have gone to a toys r us and actually compared the product to other simular products . i would suggest anyone do the same prior to buying it
1	my family loves this game because there are several different games you can play with it and it goes along with the book , so the kids like to compare it.this product is very durable and will last
1	this toy is a wonderful first toy . it captures their attention and has all kinds of handles for them to grab when they 're ready ! i absolutely love it , and so does my son
1	someone gave these to us when my son was 9 months old . he loved holding them and it has been fun watching him learn to `` color '' and develop his hand-eye coordination . he is now 22 months old and we 've just used them up and i had to buy the crayola tub crayons because i could n't find these at toys r us . the crayola crayons are thinner ( which does n't hold up as well to toddler abuse ) and have more colors , but i like these better because they come with the ducky sponge to wash the crayon off the walls ( my son loves that part , too ) . these crayons are a surefire way to get my son into the bathtub
0	it seems like a nice complete set of playfood , except that the boxes are really flimsy cardboard , and i 've thrown most of them out already . it does n't take much to crush them . there are much nicer sets out there , and there are separate pieces sold on ebay , that are probably used but will stand the test of your kids much better . not worth the money
1	very interesting spoof of the original game . i found the first one boring after a few plays , but this one still interests my kids and i after 10+ plays . it 's a bit convoluted to put it together initially , but well worth it
0	this is a great starter deck for any duelist . with just a few booster packs this deck will become unstopable ! after only a few days of practice with this deck i had beaten all of my friends who had been dueling for months .
0	i would n't even give this toy one star if i was n't forced to . mattel should be ashamed of themselves for putting out a product with 1980 's graphics and even worse sound . it sounds like my husband 's 1985 casio watch . the only thing they did well with this product is market it . i gave this to my daughter from santa and i am still going to return it .
1	even though i 'm convinced that all monitors work differently in different locations , this model has treated us well . we got this monitor ( with dual receivers ) for my first daughter 3 1/2 years ago and it was always clear crisp . reception was perfect in the basement , in the frontyard , in the backyard ... even at the neighbor 's house . one of the receivers konked out after about 2 years but we survived with only one . the second receiver finally stopped working last week after doing waaaaayyyy too much internet research , i decided to go with the same , trusty , inexpensive monitor and it works great ! i 've never slept with a monitor in our room ( because our babies stay with us for a long time ) so i do n't know about nighttime quirks . i keep the monitor in our kitchen area to listen for the little one waking up from naps ... .and to spy on the girls when they play upstairs without me . : ) baby # 3 is on the way i 'm sure this monitor will last another 3 years until we do n't need it anymore . so , $ 40 over the course of 3 children is n't bad !
1	we received boggle jr as a gift at christmas . my daughter is almost four and absolutely loves this game . she is learning her words and is learning to spell . this is a wonderful game for learning picture recognition and verbalization and moving on to spelling three and four letter words . i told my sister and she requested it for her son . he 's a happy camper with the game , too
0	my son loved the idea of this toy and was so excited to receive it as a birthday gift . however one club broke almost immediately and the other broke shortly after that . it is poor quality and construction . do n't use it unless your kids are the gentle kind . most kids would break this the first time . [ ...
0	this item came in the mail and my 4 year old son and i were very excited . i guess we should have read the description more carefully because i was n't expecting so many tiny little pieces . we used ticky tack and began the tedious process of sticking the different sized stars and such all over his room . we waited that night to see the glowing celestial extravaganza . we kept the light on for some time to 'charge ' the glow in the dark element then turned off the light . what we found was nothing close to amazing . the glow was fairly dim and only lasted for a very short period of time . we even turned a blacklight on them and all that did was make them glow a little brighter but , again , the glow only lasted about 10 -15 minutes . i ended up going back online and buying glow in the dark paint and a star shaped sponge . we dabbed stars all over his ceiling . these glowing stars last most of the night and our friends and family think his room is really cool
1	okay , we all know about the disney cars craze and trying to hunt down all the new die-cast characters mattel puts out . these 1:24 scale models are very , very nice and the size is perfect for young boys , girls or collectors . the only downside is that they only made mater and mcqueen . who would n't love to see chick hicks or the king in 1:24 scale ? ! come on mattel ! get with it ! ! ;
0	this thing is a waste of time effort and money . it falls apart the minute the child tries to swing the baby , not to mention it is too small for a two tear old to play with
1	we learned about these blocks years ago when my now 13 year old was in pre-school . i was amazed at how these seemingly simple pieces of wood , so totally enraptured these little kids ! kapla , are 'blocks ' that are all exactly the same size . at first glance , they seem boring . but once you start playing with them , they are so much more . they can be made into all kinds of structures , and can even be raised higher than one can reach , without falling ! ! when our 'surprise blessing ' turned 2 , i pulled them out for him . he enjoyed them ( though at 3 he likes them much more ) , but what surprised me is that my older two ( 15 and 13 ) love playing with them as well ! ! in fact , we all do ! ! i know it seems like a lot of money to spend on these , but they are more than worth it !
0	my daughter got this for christmas this year and almost immediately pulled off the top half of the greg character on the keyboard . in their defense , none of the other characters have come off so we will try to return this in case it was an isolated incident . other than that , she seems to like it . she also received the accordian and loves it so i would recommend that over the keyboard
1	the wagon is great , as expected . 5 stars for the wagon , no stars for delivery . it arrived with a dent , though , and when we called they told us a replacement would n't be available until mid-february , plus we 'd have to figure out how to re-pack the thing , which was halfway assembled before we noticed the dent . . . so we gently banged it out and spray-painted the spot , and the recipients probably wo n't care , but it was a pain-in-the-butt , and there did n't seem any way to deal with it that would n't have been too much trouble .
0	just received one for my son 's birthday . he loves it as he has a laptop like daddy . the quality is terrible , like another user 's experience the right side of the device does n't work properly and this is brand new . apparently the sensors on the device do n't line up properly with the go circles or volume icons on pages with them on the right side . i ca n't exchange it as i am not in the us so we can only play with half a book unless we experiment with finding where the right side sensors actually are . this of course is very frustrating to a 3 yr old as it really messes up alot of stuff . also the type of pencil seems rally sharp and brittle for a 4 yr old . ps the box says for 4-8 yr olds vs amazons text of less than 4 by the manufacturer
1	i like the language tutor and the music stuff ! i also like the screen savers ! it 's given me great ideas ! i play with it in a different way than you are supposed to . like if i need a story starter i go to the `` magic act '' and read the sentences for an idea
1	we bought this toy for our 1 year old son . it is very sturdy and well made and the blocks inside are great . i agree with the other reviews that the wagon moves to fast on wood floors and it does not turn well . my biggest compaint , however , is that when both lids are closed , the wagon looks just like a 2-step ladder . our son constantly tries to climb it , like stairs . the other day , he finally stood up on top of the wagon and the wagon tipped straight over onto the handle . my son fell over with it and crashed on his face . there are two rubber stoppers on the back of the wagon , but they do not prevent it from falling over . my son is fine , but this toy is very dangerous and i do not recommend it !
1	i am confused by the poor reviews of this product . my daughter received this toy from the easter bunny this year and the whole family plus grandparents/aunts/uncles etc . have had a ball with it . it creates huge bubbles round or long , that float in the air for quite a bit of time . i do agree that the solution runs out very quickly and it is too hard for a three year old to work ... but for the price i have to say this toy is well worth it ! we also made our own solution ( granny 's recipe ) and it worked ... very messy and sudsy though . i would recommend this product to anyone who loves bubbles
0	the stars may be really nice , but the package i received looked already open . the 3 sheets with stickers appeared as if someone soaked them in water and the package was missing the putty to stick up the bigger plastic stars .
0	swing comes out of base every time you try to put the baby doll in it and i bought the exact baby for it . the educational value of 3 stars is for me , you get what you pay for most of the time
0	this is a piece of garbage . the balls deflate after a couple hours . the rim is so frail it wo n't hold up to much . my friend came over and yelled slam dunk threateningly at my hoop at which point i got in between them and the hoop and said this hoop was not for slam dunking . they correctly pointed out that it says `` slam dunk challenge '' right on the back board . do n't do it - it will break . when i turned it on it kept score wrong and gave points for misses . so that function is worthless . the only reason i gave it two stars is that it looks kind of cool but will have to find a nerf ball .
0	this jack in the box is pretty flimsy . not worth the price . would have returned it but it would have not been worth the expense .
1	my three children are huge fans of melissa and doug puzzles and with as many as we own we sure needed a way to store them neatly . being an organization freak myself , i was in search of the perfect storage case . not only did it need to hold many puzzles , but it needed to be made well and look nice too . melissa and doug to the rescue - once again ! we purchased the same storage case in natural and it 's been a life saver in our toy room - it makes it easy for them to put the puzzles away without them losing pieces anymore . you might find it hard to spend $ 30 on an empty storage case so i suggest looking for the storage case that comes with six puzzles for $ 60 instead . more for your money ! in our case , we own so many puzzles that we did n't need anymore and especially duplicates of what we already have
1	we bought this pool toy for our daughter , and she was thrilled ! ! ! but after being on this toy one time we now call him the bucking bull . good luck staying on the silly thing . now my child sits and hangs on to the handles and we pull her around the pool on it . my husband and i can not stay on this thing either . every now and then we bail on with sheer determination , only to be off in a matter of seconds
0	i bought this toy along with mr . incredible for my son 's birthday . he loves the movie and was very excited to get these toys . unfortanitly , they lasted all of five minutes before syndromes head fell off , and mr. incredibles hand broke off . after that i had to deal with a crying kid . if you want the toy just to look at , then it is good , but if you buy it for your child , do n't expect it to last long
0	whatver your favorite fruit may be , this game will certinaly not be in your cadre of favorite games . it is basically boring , and ill-conceived . i have played it a few times with my kids , and found it to be of no particular interest on any level-it is neither fun , exciting or challenging , for them or me . i strongly recommend you try a cranium game , or how about chess ? ? ? the only positve thing i can think of with regard to this widly overrated game , is that it 's better than tv , which is n't saying much
0	i purchased this for my 8 year old for christmas and thought i would be able to store more than just a few songs , but the memory capacity is actually only 109m and will actually only hold about 8-10 songs , no where near the 2 hours promised . i would not recommend this purhcase to any child
1	just wanted to let others know this info that i found out after reading the tip given by the reviewer about getting the table for a lot cheaper at costco ... i called costco and they carried the kidkraft art table with two stools back in january of 2006 , and will no longer be carrying it . you can find it at walmart for $ 66 plus shipping , just check the website . the table is not the same however -- the dimensions are different , the sides of the tables is slightly different ( on one side of the kidcraft table has two cups and a mesh basket in between the two cups , and the other side has a space where little legos can snap onto ) . the stools are also tiny compared to the ones that come with this table . overall it looks a little less substantial , but since i have n't seen it in person , i really ca n't give my opinion . hope that helps someone
0	i bought this for my 2 yr old daughter . i was so surprised at the quality for little tykes . it has no storage and the refridgerator door would not stay closed . i think it should cost half of what it does . i purchased the step two kitchen when my daughter was three , and it is way better by far
1	i am the star wars fanatic i really like this toy ! it has firing misiles and stickers to put on the vehicle . and , you can open the wings ! this is a great toy !
1	this is the best game for the beach and the car . the little letters clip right into the board . it has a zipper case also . it 's great and we enjoy it very much
0	this was purchased for my 2 yr old son who loved to draw and scribble . he was so excited to see thomas riding the track - well it worked the day we opened it and never again ! i would recommend not spending the money on this one and get the regular aquadoodle for 1/2 the price ! you are not able to wash the mat so if you get anything on it ( eg . crayon or dirt ) you ca n't get it out .
0	i was so excited when i ordered my star wars holographic emperor figure . i 'd been waiting for this exclusive figure be available for weeks ! ! when i got home today , the box with the amazon logo was on my doorstep . upon opening the box , i was completely disappointed to find that the emperor figure i 'd been waiting for was damaged since it was jammed into the box so that the backing card was crushed . the people packing this stuff are half-wits ! ! anybody with a brain would know better than to cram something into a box like that ! ! they should be ashamed of their service to all you collectors out there ... .beware ! !
0	my son kept seeing the commercials for this doll and he wanted it so badly . talked about it for a month so we got it for him . he was super excited when he got and and the thing did n't work . it just randomly gives clues that confused my son the point of tears . he was so confused it would tell him that he was close to it , then say he was no where near it . then when he was standing next to it , it said he was no where near it . he was so disappointed . he thought the toy would be able to play hide n seek with him . we followed the directs and helped him play with it . he 's 4 . ( he was n't running around like crazy like another person mentioned was why it does n't work for some kids . ) i think this is a terrible toy and hayley 's now in the trash . she 's too cheap and junky looking to even save for my daughter as a regular doll to play with
1	my son received this as a christmas gift , and thoroughly enjoys it . this is not a regular dvd . it is designed to go with the `` read with me dvd '' system ( a separate remote control that works with it on your tv ) . a previous reviewer was not aware of this , so it should not have received a bad review for consumer error
1	i enjoy seeing my twin four year old son 's play with the read with me dvd program and cd 's . the children are learning as they play . i see them recalling information and reviewing parts of the story . this educational toy is very engaging . the only problem i have with this toy is sometimes if the child is not on level with the dvd player it takes several tries to get the dvd player to respond to the remote .
1	my two year old boy absolutely loves these puzzles . they 're soft but sturdy and are more challenging than peg puzzles . it 's a great puzzle for kids that can do more than peg puzzles but are n't ready for the regular 10 piece interlocking puzzles . there 's a base template for each puzzle to help put it together or you can remove it for a bigger challenge . the only downside are some of the very small pieces ... definitely need parental supervision for kids under 3
1	i 've heard no complaints from either one , it 's a hit
0	please . these things suck . oh , wow ! its got a 3 inch screen ! ! big deal ! my portable dvd player is 10.2 inches ; almost tripple the size of this ! the quality is pixely and crap , and you have to buy the stupid `` video now '' pvds . $ 14 for , what ? 6 episodes ? oh , thats so cool , as in not really . trust me people . stick to portably dvd player . yes , they are very expensive , but they will last twice as long . if you want a really good dvd player , buy the 10.2 inch insigna portable dvd . yeah , its $ 260 , but it is worth every penny . so , all in , if you are gulliable , and like blowing your money on a device that is better left in the store , buy this ! but , if you are like me , stick to dvd players .
0	i 'm sorry no as a matter of fact i am not sorry this doll looks like she can be in three six mafia video dancing in the background . who told mattel that this was a good idea ? is this mattel 's vein attempt to give the dolls an `` urban '' feel if mattel feels this is appropriate to teach young girls to dress like ho 's and teach them that their body is all that they have to offer then mattel has some messed up views of the world . honestly people this doll is not innocent looking it looks like it could be on that hbo documentary about hookers . what happened to the times when a kid could be a kid and play with a normal looking doll .
1	i bought this bed for my two year old because he got too big for his crib . he moves around a lot in his sleep so i wanted a safe first bed for him . he absolutely loves this bed and actually he is sleeping much better now than he was before . the only problem was that the mattress and box spring we bought were too high , so we just use the mattress for now . eventually we 'll put the box spring back in .
0	for the most part this is a good toy . it was actually one of the easier items i took out of a box this week : ) my daughter ( 4 ) loves it and as long as you can tolerate the `` mommy/daddy the wing fell off can you put it back on ? '' every 5-10 minutes then it really is good . i guess if your child is old enough and has the dexterity to put the wings back on by herself this toy would be great
0	with five kids under the age of 9 and four leapsters in the house , there is rarely a time when someone is n't playing one ( if not all ! ) of them . we have about 10 of the cartridges , and this was the most disappointing ( followed closely by spiderman ) . there simply is n't enough for them to do with it . the beauty of the leapster is the ability to interact with the games , and learn while they do it . watching a video on a 2 inch screen just does n't cut it .
1	legendary stars billy barty and diana rigg bring one of the world 's most beloved fairy tales to life in the cannon movie tale , `` snow white . '' starring beautiful and charming sarah patterson ( the company of wolves ) in the title role as the princess who fled her wicked , jealous , and murderous stepmother 's castle as a child , `` snow white '' tells the tale of how the princess is taken in by seven kindly dwarfs living in a cottage in the forest . as the dwarfs go off to dig in their mines each day , snow white cooks and keeps house for years , growing into a sweet and lovely young woman . but , as snow white grows ever more beautiful , the evil queen grows ever more jealous . consulting her magic mirror and book of spells for ways to terminate snow white , the dwarfs must repeatedly undo her vicious magic . it seems the final spell is beyond even the dwarfs abilities to break though . their only hope lies in a young prince who is returning home from a long journey still seeking a great discovery to satisfy the longing in his heart . `` snow white '' sits among the best of the nine wonderful cannon movie tales , which are among the best live-action fairy tale films available to date . sticking more closely to the original stories from the brothers grimm , `` snow white '' and the other cannon tales mix in simple but fun-filled songs with fantastic casts and writing that blends realism and fantasy seamlessly . `` snow white '' features some of the best songs in the lot , and it 's clear that diana rigg really has a ball with her villainous role . it 's so terrific that these childhood favorites many of us remember from the disney channel 's 1980 's and early 90 's glory are finally available on dvd ( most of them at least ) . the dvds include trailers ( not sure if these films ran anywhere theatrically ) , and `` snow white '' is the only one of the four that i currently own that is presented in a letterbox format ( though not much of one ) . the cannon movie tales are mostly family fun , though be warned that some can have their scary moments ( for example , `` red riding hood , '' my favorite , is done as a werewolf story that at times may be a bit frightening ) . the other cannon movie tales , all of which i highly recommend , are : rumpelstiltskin , the emperor 's new clothes , red riding hood , puss in boots , hansel and gretel , beauty and the beast , the frog prince , and sleeping beauty . those last two have not yet been released to dvd , and i have yet to see rumpelstiltskin at any retail stores , though amazon seems to carry it . i wish to get them all , but currently only own my favorites : red riding hood , snow white , puss in boots ( starring christopher walken ! ) , and hansel and gretel . fairy tale fanatics should own all these films , and i also highly recommend my top favorites , the disney animated versions . also , for a scarier version of snow white , pick up the outstanding , `` snow white : a tale of terror , '' starring the beautiful monica keena . more recommendations : shelley duvall 's faerie tale theatre collection ( also best known from the disney channel airings ) , shrek and shrek 2 , the slipper and the rose ( for a live-action cinderella ) , ever after ( another live-action cinderella ) , the adventures of pinocchio ( 1996 ) , peter pan ( 2003 ) , the wizard of oz , return to oz , and rodger 's and hammerstein 's cinderella ( 1965 ) among others !
1	firefly is imaginative exiting and heartfelt . it is simply the best sci-fi ... no scratch that , the best tv i 've scene scince the x files . the acting is very good , the stoyline is compeling and by the last episode i felt like i was part of the crew . i cant believe they pulled it before they even had a chance , does that remind you of anything ? . so here we are stuck with law and order svcipu and the so called reality garb when we could be watching something truly original . what happened to tv that makes us think . dont get me wrong but , saving lives and putting away pervs is all good but , its all the same ! where is capt kirk , where is moulder , where is river ? ? ? : ( science fiction does'nt mean out of this world , firefly really hits home and holds a message for all of us right here in the 21st century . watch the first episode and you 'll be hooked , i was
0	i 'm a fan of ncis , but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd 's area released months behind those in the usa . why is this only available to those in the usa ?
0	this version is eleven minutes shorter than the orginal version based on the information printed on the dvd and listed in the imdb . i saw this film a long time ago and was looking forward to seeing it again , but was amazed at how much they had cut out of the movie . the dvd packaging does not state that it is an edited version nor does the information provided by amazon . they made it a totaly different movie with the editing that was done . i do not recommend this version to anyone . the orginal movie deserves better than this chop job
1	i remember seeing this movie years ago in college and have continued to like it ever since . the movie starts off at the 1988 calgary olympics . doug dorsey ( d.b . sweeny ) is a talented hockey player and kate mosley ( moira kelly ) is a pairs figure skater . both have mishaps during their big moments , doug suffering a career ending injury and kate falling during her performace and failing to meet her own expectations . the movie picks up a few years later with kate having trouble getting a new partner and doug is on the skids unable to fulfill his dream of becoming a star hockey player . added to the mix is kate 's russian couch anton pamchenko ( played by the great roy dotrice ) who decides rick will be kate 's new partner as they struggle to get back to the 1992 olympics . at first glance this is a sports movie about figure skating , but that is not entirely so . the scenes involving the leads on the ice are surprisingly abstract as neither is a professional skater . in truth this is a character driven story and most of the action takes place off the ice . it is absolutely charming to watch the two lead characters go from a dislike of one another , to extreme rivalry and finally ending up in love . the thing that absolutely makes this happen is the chemestry between the leads sweeney and kelly . they are magic together on the screen , so much so that i am surprised they never paired up again for another movie . i highly recommend this light hearted romance to everyone . on a side note about the dvd , the only special feature is the theatrical trailer . there are no deleted scenes . this is where i have a question , because the version of the film on this dvd and that i 've scene on tv in recent years is not the one i remember seeing in college . i distinctly remember the end scene was the medal ceremony . i somewhat like that version because what doug and kate won in that version was so much more . so where is the version with the alternative ending ? ? ?

0	the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his `` harmful if swallowed '' c.d . the c.d . also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long . the one star rating is not based on the content . it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers
1	`` breaking away '' is a true rarity : a feel-good movie that does n't that is n't silly . yes , there are plenty of laughs in it , but they 're the result of great acting and writing , not the cheap , crude one-liners that litter so many of today 's so-called `` comedies . '' and while the movie will tug at your heartstrings , it never spills over into gooey sentimentality or empty pathos . but i also feel sort of sad whenever i watch `` breaking away . '' the small-town downtown where the guys hang out is just a fading memory for most americans . and are there any old swimming holes anymore , like the quarry that the characters visit ? or have they all been paved over , for `` luxury '' mcmansion subdivisions ? shut me up ! just watch `` breaking away '' and enjoy it
1	this is a pretty original 70s horror movie starring two very likeable and attractive stars of the era - katharine ross and sam elliot . it 's just fun , not really all that scary or even too tense . basically sam and katharine end up unwilling guests in a spooky mansion where the guests are dropping off like flies while waiting for an old spooky man to pass away and leave them an inheritance . roger daltry makes an appearance . the deaths are all way over the top , and it 's just fun . dvd is the movie plus a trailer . that 's about it , but the transfer is great considering the age of the movie . great spooky flick for a cold night by the fire .
1	i just read dirk 's `` spolier '' ending to the mothman prophecies and had to say huh ? demonic , fallen angles ? what ? did we watch the same movie ? if all you go by is the movie , that might be the impression you 're left with . but if you 've ever looked into the events that happened around point pleasant , or any of the books on the subject , you 'll see that the mothman was more ufo related than anything . at same time of the mothman sightings the point pleasant area was in a wave of ufo reports , men-in-black , and all sorts of goings-on up in the sky . in fact , mothman played only a very small part in the drama , it was by far predominately ufo related , as keel makes clear . unfortunately , the producers chose to abandon this aspect of the story entirely , and so the happenings at point pleasant lost their entire frame of reference . if you see this movie thinking this was the way things actually happened , you might come to the conclusion of the mothman being evil , demonic , fallen angles , whatever you like . but if you research the incident at all , you 'll see you 're only getting a fraction of the story from the movie . and if , like dirk , you thereby think you know all about what mothman actually was based on just the movie alone , then all your conclusions end up being based simply on a hollywood writer 's imagination and script and nothing more . mothman having anything to do with demons and angels or any religious overtones is as far from the truth as you could possibly be . do n't judge by the movie , read the book
0	this was my first download of this type and also my last . i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare . there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless . the machines keep freezing up . the idea is nice but the technology is n't there yet
0	this movie is a dog , pure and simple . we ended up with two of these are the freebie give aways for the last few dvd players we bought . they ca n't sell it , so they 're giving them away . hide ... fast
1	this movie is so stupid it is funny . i saw it when it first came out and i still have n't forgotten it nor will i ever . this is what the writers of the groove tube , saturday night live , and second city television are all about . watch this film and see a true comedy classic . individual skits like `` catholic high school girls in trouble '' could have been made into a full length movie all to itself . it was an era where one did n't have to be politically correct . this is what comedy is all about . forget the garbage we see today . forget martin lawrence or cedric the entertainer . see kentucky fried movie and you will see what comedy is suppose to be or what it once was . oh , by the way , stephen bishop also has a cameo role in this film and he is n't singing `` on and on ''
1	i do n't recall having seen a film where the actors enjoyed more playing their roles . they seemed to have had a ball
1	the immortal yi soon shin is the best drama i have seen ever . korean , american , does n't matter ! this is better than anything i have ever seen on tv or in the movies . hollywood can not touch this one ! kim myoung min ( yi soon shin ) is outstanding in this ! ( no wonder he won the 2005 kbs best actor award for iyss ) it starts from when he was a child to his adulthood and can be emotional , funny , sad , and can make you angry ! ! the numerous obstacles and prejudices this man had to overcome and then always bounced back with no complaint because of the love of his country is phenomenal ! ! he put his country above all else and kim myoung min did a great job of portraying that ! my whole family , kids and all , watched this with me and loved it ! i can see why yi soon shin is korea 's hero and why other countries teach his methods
1	this is a good alternative to the bombard of hollywood films . it potrays beutifully and naturally the meaning of love and the loneliness of the elderly . i live in one of the asian countries where the famili members still have strong emotional bound to one another . watching this film , i came to realize how lonely one 's life can be when one grows old in the so called modern countries . because things are so modernized , things have got so mechanical , human relation is no exception . this happens to the mother in this film . it is so touchy to see when the mother and the father come to visit her son 's family , everybody is so busy with his/her business , everybody is in a rush and in the end the two of them have to stay in a quiet house with nobody around . their visit is not strong enough to hold people from minding his/her business . her being attracted to the young carpenter is a sign that she actually needs attention and that she is lonely rather than the raw 'love ' between a man and a woman . i recommend this film to those who love to watch a film about love , family and relationship .
1	we have all wondered what would happen if the alien and predator met ... head-to-head . this movie answers that question very well . no cheesiness . we have watched this movie so many times we have lost count , and we still watch it sitting on the edge of our seats or our knees to our chest . great saturday evening movie
1	there are buttered-up popcorn movies that entertain you , score a ticket to `` jurassic park '' and spielberg for that , and there are films with gravitas , that move you , disturb you , drag you to the altar kicking and screaming , to consider circumstances you might not brave yourself.. '' badlands , '' terrence malick 's 1973 directorial debut , an overlooked jewel of a film , forcibly moves you , and takes an unsavory subject , the charles starkweather serial killings ' crime spree , up in the vacated badlands of south dakota , and refines it til you posit , `` how did we get here as a country ? what went wrong ? `` ..and then you appraise the challenges a film-maker overcomes to project the psychopathic wrath of two teenagers ( martin sheen as kit carruthers , sissy spacek as holly sargis ) on a thrill-killing `` honeymoon '' , onto the silver screen and make it empathetic , palatable..why would anyone care in the first place about two low-life , lost highway delinquents , who shoot a parent , assume they can get away consequence-free , and move on with their careless lives like nothing more infractious than cutting an afternoon civics class has occurred ? ..however , `` badlands '' is rooted in unfortunate fact , these inexplicable events happened to a pedestrian populace in north america , and malick lets you tag along in this teenage angst riddled odyssey , deeper and deadlier into an american wasteland..the film is palpable evil genuis , arguably a top ten american film classic , irrespective it was shot by a first time director , with an unknown cast.. '' badlands '' resonates with gritty authenticity , cinematic style , fierce inhumanity , and the most haunting musical score ( erik satie 's gymnopedies 3 ) that underwrites a sissy spacek voice over narration , spoken in a lazy monotone like a detached schoolgirl explaining away her unexcused absence in the principal 's office , when in fact holly ( sissy spacek ) is the fractured other half of the kit carruthers ' killing machine , a bossom buddy in crime..some films are purposefully pure entertainment , escapist faire.. '' badlands '' on the other hand is rare art , belongs in a museum
1	this movie tugs at your heart strings in a completely honest way . the movie does not patronise or make pathetic the boy hero who has to endure . it is the very opposite of saccharine glop . it is a profoundly optimistic and yet realistic movie . the movie is peppered with memorable eccentric and kind characters .
0	i am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company 's software . the vid is encrypted so that you need amazon 's player to view it . blah . you 're better off buying the dvd for $ 20 with all the episodes so at least you can watch the dvd somewhere other than your own computer .
0	this is still to this day one of the most aweful films i ever saw . i took a girl ona date for this movie and wow , what a mistake . the movie has no real plot and just gets worse as you watch it more .
1	once more the irreverent vision of georges bernard shaw , carves in relief with this story about a rich girl who decides to join the salvation army . wendy hiller one of my beloved `` brides '' of the screen makes a delightful and terrific performance in this satire of mistakes where she will discover the other side of the life .
0	the extreme reviews here are very misleading ; people either say it 's the worst film ever made or godard 's best film . do n't believe either camp . if you 're not an expert on godard and/or 1960s avant-garde cinema , i could definitely see a person writing off this movie as `` sheer pretentious crap '' , but that opinion would derive from a mixture of shock and ignorance . on the other hand , those who say this is godard 's finest work must be riding high on acid and marxism themselves . the truth of the matter is that `` weekend '' , like every one of godard 's post-anna karina films , is more a flawed experiment than anything else : on occasion , interesting and thought-provoking , but more often static and didactic to the point of alienating the viewer rather than converting them . i respect godard 's attempt to create a new cinema built on `` ideas '' rather than `` emotion '' , but in my opinion , he went too far in this direction . a piece of art devoid of any emotion is a hollow experience and do n't we have enough of that in our crude , consumerist society ? and as far as experiments go , much of what he was doing in `` weekend '' , he had already done and with vastly better results in `` pierrot le fou '' . that film was a perfect balance between godard the political-scientist and godard the post-modern film-maker . plus , `` pierrot le fou '' benefited by having jean-paul belmondo and anna karina . they brought heart and humor to godard 's abstract explosion of ideas ; a perfect symbiotic relationship between director and actor ( s ) that he never achieved again . `` weekend '' starts off very promising with the sex dialogue and the long tracking shot of the traffic-jam , leading to a car-crash ... but then it descends into a grating mess of dated ideology and too much dead space . you really wish belmondo and karina would pop in and show the cast they do n't have to be mere nails to godard 's hammer .
1	hey , i wo n't pretend to write anything better than `` chris kent '' did below in march of 2003 . just read his excellent review that not only captures the film 's qualities , but also the era in which the film was released
1	derek jarman 's 'sebastiane ' is a momentous painting which is simply brushed on film rather than canvas . this is a master work and should be in any serious film buff 's cabinet . ( i should very much like to see it running continuously upon a smooth stone wall of a monumental pillared vestibule - perhaps like the four seasons in new york . it 's visual beauty should be constantly on view . not one element could be added or deleted . if i may continue the painting analogy , each stroke , whether finished or raw melds this work into a composition which i think is flawless . the men are beautiful , but in a tangible human manner . the settings , whether diocletian 's startling lurid palace or the rough bare terrain of sardinia evoke both pagan and christian motifs flawlessly . good and evil ( and all shades between ) found in both places ; the irony of the world as it is and has always been . the homoerotic nature of the film is vicseral , candid rather than overtly condescending - it might well be set in modrn iraq with 21st century troops . i felt each character 's longings , whether for the god of carnal flesh or that of human love and companionship or a spiritual and other worldly deity . the recognituion that each of these forms of eros may entertwine and meld is genious . it is everyman . it is a scrupulus portrait of the easily duplicit qualities of beauty , deceipt , brutality and even truth . powerful stuff .
0	there are bad movies , and then there are bad movies . `` universal soldier : the return '' is a cosmically bad movie , a movie so poor in every aspect of its execution that one would have to look to `` manos : the hands of fate '' for comparison . the first `` universal soldier '' film was a moderately entertaining shoot 'em up flick starring action stars jean-claude van damme and `` rocky '' refugee dolph lundgren that essentially accomplished what it set out to do : people perished in violent ways , stuff exploded , and van damme and lundgren beat each other into bloody pulps at the end of the film . even the presence of the charming ally walker as van damme 's female sidekick greatly helped the film . the movie garnered enough attention and fans to merit the release of a special edition dvd some time back . it unfortunately also garnered enough attention and fans to merit this unredeemable piece of trash sequel . the second , and one hopes final , installment in a franchise that should never have become a franchise achieves such heights of utter banality and stupidity that i sat in open-mouthed awe watching it . i think i can safely say i am less of a person for having sat through this atrocity . expect to spend a few days in a coma after the credits roll . van damme returns as luc , the reanimated soldier who triumphed over the forces of government sponsored evil in the first film . on this outing he now works for dr. dylan cotner ( xander berkeley ) , a scientist who reconstituted the universal soldier program with the help of his supercomputer s.e.t.h . luc , with his female sidekick maggie ( kiana tom ) , helps design and run training missions for a new batch of super soldiers . the film opens with what the filmmakers hope is a pulse-pounding jaunt up a river , a jaunt filled with explosions , stunts , gunfire , and the briefest glimpse of tom 's incredibly fit form . as the mission grinds to a halt we learn several important things : kiana tom is incredibly hot but ca n't act her way out of a paper bag , luc has a daughter named hillary ( karis paige bryant ) who you just know will get into trouble at some point , and the only soldiers we must pay attention to are romeo ( bill goldberg ) and the one played by michael jai white . frankly , turning off the film immediately after glimpsing tom 's amazing physique is probably a good thing . everything that follows is dull , predictable , and so full of plot holes as to defy description . `` universal soldier : the return '' feels like eighty minutes of dental surgery rather than an action film . sure enough , cotner 's computer goes on the fritz and unleashes the killing power of the universal soldiers . in the resulting conflagration s.e.t.h . implants its consciousness in michael jai white , luc and his loved ones flee from the compound , and the military swoops in to contain the problem . an extraordinarily untalented actress named heidi schanz also pops in as nosy reporter called erin who is interested in exposing the government 's latest shenanigans . predictably , van damme and schanz team up to track down ... er ... well , track down something to defeat the supercomputer . i think they need some code to shut the system down , but in the meantime the film takes them all over the place so that a wisecracking romeo can follow them around while absorbing all the abuse luc can hand out . even throwing in a few scenes set in an adult 's only club ca n't make this turkey fly . it 's dull , folks , and painfully so . by the time the film grinds to its inevitable showdown between luc and s.e.t.h . back at the shattered compound -- with an injured hillary 's life balancing precariously in the background to serve as motivation for an overwhelmed luc ( geez , what a surprise there ! ) -- i knew i just wasted far too much of my life with this car wreck . how bad can it be , you ask ? read on ... plot holes in this film are innumerable , as uncountable as grains of sand on the beach or acne on a teenager 's face . for example , luc explains to erin that he was once a universal soldier just like romeo but cotner `` cured '' him by restoring him to life ; he no longer needs injections or ice or any of the other devices used by the soldiers . what the heck are we doing marveling at this amazing supercomputer when cotner just performed a miracle of biblical implications ? he brought someone back from the dead ! how exactly did he accomplish this feat ? we do n't find out from van damme , who simply smirks his way through a few lines of dialogue that simply boggle the mind with their monumentally idiotic implications . i could go on , but let 's discuss the performances instead -- or the lack thereof . i should say i adore kiana tom ; she 's a drop dead gorgeous babe with a body that could stop the earth 's rotation , but watching her stumble through dialogue is like having your appendix taken out through your mouth . another problem is the lumbering bill goldberg , whose `` funny '' lines are anything but . and the more i think about heidi schanz , the less i think of her . you have to wonder about a film where jean-claude van damme is the best thespian in the cast . you might think a movie this foolhardy should n't contain any bonus features on dvd . you would be wrong . trailers for this film , `` the return , '' `` double team , '' `` desert heat , '' `` knock off , '' `` maximum risk , '' and `` nowhere to run '' showcase the dubious career of jean-claude van damme . a making of feature , a van damme career retrospective ( ha ! ) , a michael jai white feature , and talent bios round out the disc . my advice to those viewers thinking of renting `` universal soldier : the return '' ? run , my friends , run far , far away and do n't look back .
0	i love the avatar and i was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is i 've been trying for the past days and darn it all , it 's not working ! ! ! it 's not as if i 'm downloading it for free . i am willing to pay and yet it just would n't go through ! ! ! i think it 's better to just buy the dvds ... i think it 's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that..
1	i would reccomend this film to any robert johnson fan as well as to anyone just getting into the blues who wants to know where its really at . it includes some great interviews with johnny shines , robert jr lockwood and others who knew robert . its worth it just to hear lockwood play an unrecorded song of r.j. 's ! the parts where keb ' mo ' re-enacts segments from r.j. 's life are well done and effectively illustrate what life would have been like back then for a traveling bluesman . my only criticism would be that there are few extra dvd features , however , that does n't stop me watching this film again and again ! a very informative insight into the life of one of the greatest delta bluesmen
0	i downloaded it and i could n't view the video paste the intro . then i re-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file , but it again it only had sound and not video . this one is a waste of money
1	eisenstein 's verve has never been questioned , even if it was absorbed by living in 'dark times , ' to reference hannah arendt . this feature is worth anyone 's time as the angles of observation and superb editing defy adequate description
0	ken russell is a gifted director , as his erratic career has proved , but even the great vanessa redgrave ca n't save this one . `` the devils , '' a gaudy , loud attempt to blend period detail with stark surrealism , went painfully awry . grisly images of plague victims , quack cures , peculiar enemas , and oliver reed being burned at the stake were doubtless meant to provide realistic detail -- unfortunately , they are merely stomach-turning . a stocky , wild-eyed oliver reed is sadly lacking in erotic appeal as father grandier , the womanizing priest of a seventeenth-century french town , and most of the other characters are so unlikable that one wishes the entire town had been burned at the stake . gemma jones is one bright spot as grandier 's innocent love interest , and ms. redgrave gives her all to the thankless role of sister jeanne , but the film as a whole is unpalatable and disturbing . not for the faint of heart
1	my brother , henry , always said this was his favorite movie . he loved film noir ... ( although i did n't know what that was at the time ) and , of course , he loved richard widmark in his role . looking back , widmark should have gotten the academy award for best suppporting actor for this ( he was nominated ) but there are many oscar `` should'ves '' . if you like prison/gangster movies , classic film noir , richard widmark , victor mature and , of course , brian dunleavy , you 've got ta see/own this ... if you havn't/do n't already
1	this one has one of those touching endings where you get to see that even booth has a heart ... well , more so than we already know . the ending got me , i got misty over it . enjoy with someone you love
1	this movie shows the real life hell that was andersonville . a prison camp that turned into a death camp . not enough food , water or shelter for all the prisoners sent there . the south was losing the war so they had no provisions or men to assist in the detainment of these captured soldiers . basically letting them rot slowly inside the walls that confinded them . a well acted movie which shows the hell that can come from wa
1	there is no way around it , no matter how it is staged shakespeare will inevitably feel like a stage play . that it is acted by two of britains foremost stage actors of the time , kenneth branagh and emma thompson ( who at this stage were still married ) adds to the feeling . there is some over the top voice projection , but generally this feels light , fun and a pretty glorious rendition of one of shakespeares frothiest plays . much ado about nothing really is just what it says . the premise is that the duke returns from the wars with a half-brother whom dislikes him but has reconciled with him simply to create problems . which he manages to do , embroiling the hapless hero ( the heroine of the story ! ) and her love . it is all based on falsehood and nothing . branagh and thompson play the battling ex-lovers who are reconciled during the course of the movie , but this does n't stay their battling wits and shrewdness . this is one point where their clear diction and stage presence makes a huge difference as each word and inference can be celarly understood . there are wonderful set scenes - the arrival of the duke and his men , and the finish with the dancing through the grounds was gorgeous . the real winner of the movie has to be the house and grounds it is set in - how wonderful ! who would n't want to live in italy after seeing this movie - and a nice way to learn some of shakespeare good fun
0	if you are a christian , this book is n't for you . it is full of blashphemy , concluding that we must `` ... forgive god '' and that we must love god `` ... even if he isnt perfect '' . kusher even has the will to say that `` ... god would not be god ... '' without our love for him . at one point he reduces god to an aminal saying that in the garden of eden , when god said `` ... let us make man in our image '' he was speking to animals and creation . kusher explains that god created the world , and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution . since when was god in need of forgiveness ? isnt it that `` ... god so loved the world '' and it wasnt us that loved god ? i have no words in describing this book . it is full of error , because it does not base it self on the gospel of jesus christ . all this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner , and that it isnt your fault , and that actully you are a good person . why do bad things happen to good people ? wrong question . there are no good people in the world in the first place. `` for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god ... '' the world is in sin . the world does not have good people ! ! only by the grace of god , through faith in jesus christ you are made righteous . i beg you in the name of jesus christ to stay away from this book . it hasnt helped 4 million people , but it lied to them . kusher , please turn from your ways and come to jesus , then will you understand the life question `` why ''

0	i purchsed this video a few years ago and was also very disappointed . i have nothing more to add to the other reviews posted here ; just to agree that the sound was poor and the viewing quite fuzzy . i remember watching not only the first broadcast on nbc but several broadcasts years after that , with different casts . it was and still is my favorite christmas story . i will certainly purchase the schippers cd and hope to see another video or dvd in the future
0	i 'm a huge don cheadle fan , but this film is unworthy of him . [ people ] who claim that it 's a story about racism either do n't understand the film or do n't understand racism . basically , here 's the plot : the character played by mekhi pfeiffer is an unwitting accomplice in a botched armed robbery that leaves three people dying on the floor of a grocery store . rather than summon help for the others , all pfeiffer can think to do is help himself to the money in the cash register . he is caught , and in the ensuing trial the prosecutor calls him an animal because of his depraved indifference to human life . that is supposed to be the psychological turning point in the film , because pfeiffer 's family insists on proving that he 's no animal and can take his punishment -- in this case , death -- with his head held high . yeah , right . guess what ? he is an animal , and if the story had involved all-black or all-white characters , racism would n't be an issue . a more compelling question : if pfeiffer 's family was so concerned with his `` dignity , '' why did n't they teach him moral values in the first place
1	herman wouk 's book `winds of war ' became a bestseller upon its publication , just like its sequel `war and remembrance ' a few years later . these thick books , joining the fictional and historical events during second world war , provided the subject matter for one of the greatest achievements in the history of the tv miniseries . this 6-dvd set covers the first book , with an 18-hour series shot in 1983 . the plot concerns a military family named henry , scattered and absorbed by the winds of war . we follow the patriarch victor `pug henry ( robert mitchum ) , an experienced military officer who in the spring 1939 is appointed to be a military attaché for the usa in berlin . he is accompanied by his dotty and yet quite likable wife rhoda ( polly bergen ) . their children include an oldest son , the flyboy warren ( ben murphy ) , another son byron ( jan-michael vincent ) who is in italy and falls in love with a bit older jewish girl natalie ( ali mcgraw ) , who is the niece of the famous american-jewish writer dr. aaron jastrow ( john houseman ) . the daughter madeleine ( lisa eilbacher ) is the youngest of the three and works as a radio girl . in berlin pugh gets the hint of the atmosphere in the nazi germany of that time ( like the fact jews are treated second-class ) and predicts the upcoming pact between hitler ( günter meisner ) and stalin , both of who he gets to meet during the series . byron and natalie witness the first days of war , being caught in the midst of warsaw , where natalie followed her fiancé , the american diplomat leslie slote ( david dukes ) . the series mixes the lives of the henrys with the historical events of the war ( the occupations of poland and france ; the blitz in london ; the nazi invasion of the soviet union ; the beginnings of the `final solution ' behind the lines of the occupied russian territory ; the japanese attack on pearl harbor to name a few ) . the last episode of this first part of the story ends with the aftermath of pearl harbor : the german offensive is halted on the outskirts of moscow , pug goes to command a battleship and fight in the war , unsure of his feelings for the beautiful daughter of an old friend ( victoria tennant ) , byron fights in the submarine , while in the meantime natalie , who fell in love with byron and bore him a son , is left onboard a ship in naples which is awaiting to live for palestine , since she and her uncle could not find their way out of fascist italy , due to his passport complications . the above is just the basic description of the series and despite of what it may seem , it is not a soap opera , but rather an interesting chronicle of the war and a family influenced by its impact . pug henry gets to meet all the important players of the war ( churchill , hitler , roosevelt , stalin ... ) and in this respect is somewhat similar to young indiana jones . the war itself is shown from these two viewpoints : the henrys and the rest of the fictional characters vs. the historical ones ( hitler and his generals etc . ) there are many things that make this show one of the miniseries highlights of its time . one of them is the excellent casting . robert mitchum brings his renowned charisma for the character of pug and he does it in an excellent way . ali macgraw 's headstrong natalie makes a fine contrast to jan-michael vincent 's younger byron . the historical characters are done more than convincingly . thusly ralph bellamy is the definite fdr ( a role he had an opportunity to play years before in the theatre ) and howard lang makes a believable churchill . one must make a special reference to günter meisner and his portrayal of adolf hitler . as it will be seen in the sequel , the director and producer dan curtis wanted hitler to be overplayed . the reasons remain unknown and one can only guess that he wanted to make it less human in this way . günter meisner , the late german actor who played hitler few times during his career , although a bit too old for the role , managed to keep things under control , so despite the fact his führer is stiffed and not altogether perfect , he manages to give a hint of the evil personage hitler was . this is important to note , since his successor to the role for `war and remembrance ' , the british actor steven berkoff , was awful , playing the character as a total one-dimensional yelling buffoon . the role of hitler is a hard and yet manageable task for an actor who can make a character , as shown by bruno ganz in the recent movie `downfall ' . one of the other appeals of the show is the fact it was shot on location , with attention put to details that make the historical accuracy . most scenes were shot in my hometown zagreb , the capital of croatia , then still part of ex-yugoslavia . the producers managed to use zagreb 's past as one of the former austro-hungarian capitals to recreate berlin , lisbon , warsaw , etc . the scenery and the costumes evoke the era perfectly , thus making the whole thing believable to the viewer . other locations included usa , italy and some more . but the greatest asset is without the doubt the interesting plot which does n't let go for a moment . it is also noticeable that some of the mistakes that were made in the sequel , `war and remembrance ' , ( the narrow scope of the victims of the holocaust being one of them ) are not present here . one can only get a hint of some of the future slips here , for example , the subtle message that all the germans are bad and all americans good . this dvd collection of the series deserves a+ . seven dvds come packed in a nice sleeve . besides the series , there are several interesting extra features : through the interviews with the cast , crew and herman wouk we learn about the process of adaptation , casting , shooting and the problems they all encountered while making this epic peace . some of the footage includes things shot during the work on location in zagreb . for anyone enjoying modern history , an excellent miniseries with the interesting plot or is simply interested in second world war , this is a must-have . highly recommendable
0	shark attack is an interesting tale of deceit and stolen shark footage . the movie features some computer harpooning police men and a crazy fisherman turned taxi driver . the most interesting part is all the shark footage ... the best scene is after the bad guy/hotel owner is eaten , the shark clearly shown with a hook in it 's mouth being pulled towards a boat . this of course has nothing at all to do with the plot . so where did this hook come from ? it was probably i was trying to stab in my eyes to stop the pain of this movie
0	lorna is pretty , and her suitor is devoted . the story holds your attention . for many that is enough . some auspicious beginnings , without depth . so maybe 3-stars for some people . i give 2-stars , if i do not keep it to watch again in later years . i found the romance unfulfilling , and so the movie . romance movies that i liked better are : `` north south '' , `` pride prejudice '' -1940 , 1996 2006 , `` wives and daughters '' , and `` a walk to remember '' . adventure with romance : `` the scarlet pimpernel '' .

0	this is n't funny . it is n't well directed or scripted . perhaps it could have been great , if it had had a decent scriptwriter or director , but it did n't , so it turned out mediocre at best . unfortunately , i believed all the hype on this website and bought a copy of this for my boyfriend and i to watch . i told my boyfriend that according to most of the reviews i 'd read , this was going to be a brilliant , hilarious cult classic . but now that we 've watched it , he and i both know better . we know it 's dreadful , and i can only imagine all the nice things i 'm going to have to do for him to make up for my expecting him to sit through this tedious monstrosity . the only highlight for us was a spirited argument he and i got into halfway through the movie about where we 'd seen one of the actors in the movie before . i 'm pleased to say i won the argument . that was pretty much the only highlight of the movie for me . in my opinion this is not a 'hilarious cult classic ' as others so often describe it . i do n't know how drunk i 'd have to be to agree with that assessment of the movie , or to find it even a little bit funny , but i suspect i would have to get smashed enough that i 'd need a stomach pump afterwards . if you want to see a genuinly hilarious cult sci-fi classic , pick up a copy of flash gordon . that has great actors , great sets , wonderfully campy scripts , brilliant humour , and a soundtrack by queen . furthermore , it has stood the test of time and is still great today , unlike 'the ice pirates ' , which has dated really badly . better yet , get hold of some 'red dwarf ' dvds ... seriously , red dwarf is sci fi humour at its best ! it 's so good , it will spoil you for other sci fi comedies

1	this has got to be the funniest , most warped show on cable today . it 's the ultimate show about nothing - a group of morally-deficient 20-somethings who own an irish pub in philadelphia . they care about nothing but outdoing each other for attention and money . they constantly argue over the dumbest things and come from families more dysfunctional than anyone can imagine . to give you an idea of the show 's themes : there are episodes that revolve around one of the characters trolling for dates at an abortion rally ; another in which the gang tries to outdo each other by pretending to be crippled , just to see who can get the most attention and sympathy from strangers ; and an episode in which the gang charges people to view a `` vision '' of the virgin mary ( actually a water stain in the bar ) . the dialogue is made up of all the things people are thinking but wo n't say . no tender or sappy moments here , these are episodes you would never see on the hallmark channel or lifetime . one of the most unique comedies on tv , and by far one of the best . i look forward to many more new seasons of `` it 's always sunny ... '' and am hopeful it does not lose its edge or pursue milktoast or nonoffensive story lines .
1	first of all i am a huge beatles nut so any movie made by them or about them i love . with that out of the way i can say that this was a very good movie . for those expecting a movie like a hard days night , it is nothing like that . this movie is about john lennon 's friend who was the bass player for the beatles at the begginging of their carrear . it shows how he lost his interst for music and fell in love wiht a german lady . i wont tell u the ending , but this is a true story . all in all i thought this was a great movie . you should defiently buy it

0	my main motivation in seeing this movie was to better understand the reputation of echo park , a little area nestled next to downtown los angeles . i moved to echo park in late 2004 . it 's depressing - the vicious cycle of drugs , dropping-out , and domestic violence . and it 's all here , told through the eyes of latina teenagers . it was easy to see the woman 's hand on the direction of the piece with the important roles that women played . i did n't care for the movie as a whole because it felt sluggish and uneven . i also found myself not caring about any of the characters . so-and-so gets shot , la la loo goes to jail . whatever ! as an aside , though , the evil neighborhood druglord was called ernesto . it turns out my next-door neighbor in real-life is also called ernesto . luckily , it 's just a coincidence
0	the episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes . this one happens to be only 18 minutes . this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle . even though it only cost me $ 2 i still got jipped . let 's hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway . be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them

0	i remember seeing children of the corn right after reading stephen king 's short story version in his classic book , night shift . i was excited because king 's story was such good scary fun . well , i watched the movie and was amazed at how awful it was . while the short story had a building atmosphere of dread and horror , the movie had an atmosphere of pure cheeze . king 's story was short ( like 10-20 pages ) and sweet , w/ sinister children and a mysterious god / monster in the cornfields . the movie has a town full of annoying brats and a cheap beasty that caused much eye-rolling and laughter . the running time is 90 minutes , including about an hour 's worth of padding . cotc would have made an excellent addition to one of king 's anthology movies like creepshow . as it stands , it 's bloated and pretty boring . of course , linda hamilton is in it , which is why i gave it an extra star ...

0	man , i do n't know what the other reviewers of this movie were smoking , but it should be illegal ! this is , first off , a terrible dvd : 4:3 ( full screen ) format , with a dark , muddy picture . worse , the plot is typical , predictable , and poorly written . other than looking for glimpses of teri hatcher 's body , sitting through this fiasco is a total bore . i was also surprised at how bad teri 's acting was in this movie , since i 've seen her do much better in things she was in previous to this . that is probably the fault of the director , erik anjou , a third-rate director ( at best ! ) who has done a total of two movies and one documentary . gee , i wonder why he is n't in more demand ( not ! ) ! i can enjoy `` b '' movies , and bad movies , but this one is just so totally non-involving that it is not even good enough to laugh at . i ca n't imagine that this mess was released on dvd for any reason other than to cash in on teri hatcher 's current popularity , and to suck the cash out of people who are anxious to see a younger ( 29 year-old ) teri hatcher nude . rent this , if you must , but , wow , there is no reason anyone should want to buy a movie this bad

'' the 1974 documentary is filled with footage of hitler . having had relatives who were in germany at the time , and personally knowing former german soldiers and officers , i find it difficult to believe that junge did not know of the nazi death camps as both rumors and hard evidence surfaced while they were going on . i believe she knew but because of the fact that she was so taken by hitler , perhaps she did not want to believe the rumors . my mother personally met hitler when she was 15 and was totally mezmerized by his apparent charm and grace . at any rate , `` blind spot '' repeats `` the world at war '' interviews , and is a `` talking head '' that would have been better produced with raw footage with voice-over . the three stars is for effort , minus one star for `` nothing new '' and minus another star for german and not english ( english sub-titles ) . the younger frau spoke good english in 1974 but is lost in `` blind spot .

1	this movie was much better than i expected . with all the nonsense about the `` nc-17 '' rating wooooo , i thought it was gon na be all t and more . not that i do n't like that , but the movie was exactly what siskel ebert were saying at the time : a movie that has a plot and sexuality . not porn , but a truly adult movie . this is a movie that deals with grown up issues regarding sexuality , marriage and fidelity . those who are to immature or whose sense of morality forbids them from whatching a movie about two adults having extramarital and love affairs , definately will be offended and should avoid this movie . if you can watch something like that with an open mind and are interested in such a story line or you are interested in a love story that gets a little complicated and convoluted then this is for you . i am a big fan of uma thurman and that only makes this movie better for me . the story gets a bit complicated as the lovers grow in different directions . this is a very `` artsy '' movie . it deals with comlex love and sex issues . this by the way , was the first nc-17 movie . yes , they made that rating especially for this one , but its not anywhere as hot as showgirls as far as nudity . ( see my review of that one ) i was expecially surprised to find out that this is a true story about famous people . i loved it and i give henry june 5 stars
1	doctor who materialised without his tardis on this , my first timelord download in the amazon unbox , which is much larger on the inside than it appears on the outside . for a very reasonable sum , $ 1.99 , my family and i were able to enjoy the first third doctor adventure after his regeneration , where he encounters the nestene conciousness . the down load took only a few minutes although i had some considerable difficulty installing the microsoft program . thanks to the good people at amazon tech support i was able to obtain an alternative download from the gates empire itself which allowed me to enjoy our rental . a great experience and will not be the last . easy to navigate and fun for all the family . someone should tell the timelords on gallifrey about unbox and perhaps they could get rid of all the old type 40 tardis '
1	jane fonda plays a washed up has been actress in this movie with a very bad drinking problem . she wakes up one morning next to a guy with a knife in his chest and she ca n't remember what happened the night before . then she is on the run when she meets a sympathetic young man played by jeff bridges.unlike hitchcock movies when the violins start to screetch on the soundtrack then you knw something very bad is going to happen . the violins in this movie play pretty loud but nothing happens . i figured out `` whodunnit '' in the first 30 minutes of this film and then spent the next hour trying to figure out if fonda 's hair was a wig or did she get her own hair bleached blonde ? i give this movie 5 stars because i liked the look of the loft where the dead guy lives
1	totally psychotic wedding dress designer kills his models to 'find himself ' , but his horrible wife has her own willpower to wield . bava 's direction parallels the edge of john 's insatiable drive to kill , an assaultive film experience . low budget . horrible sound , so play it loud ! ( 6/7
1	a film that centers on four friends who made a pact to leave their small town arrive at zero hour and must decide if they will go through with it . the story is simple enough , and not a whole lot happens . but there 's no denying it , this movie is enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing in every way . it 's a treat to see an intelligent movie where the main charachters are teenagers , and that the film does n't have to resort too fart jokes for an audience . not one charachter is stereotyped . they are human , and they 'll probably remind you of people you know . i applaud this kind of a movie , and i wish there would be more of them
0	this is not a good tornado disaster movie by any stretch of the imagination . the worse thing about the film is the horrible , unconvincing special-effects ! the scene where the family in the car trying to outrun the tornado in the town and the mom shrieking `` it 's coming closer ! '' is badly done and also dan starting to fly out the window and his dad attaining super-human strength pulling him back into the vehicle is incredibly stupid and not dramatic in the slightest . i know , however , a guy named mike and 2 robots who would probably have to endure this terrible b-grade movie ( actually f-grade ) if you want a good , entertaining tornado movie that does n't include bad acting , bad `` special '' fx , bad script and dumb actors check out `` twister

1	logan 's run belongs to a class of old school science fiction films which were popular in the early and mid-1970 's , prior to the beginning of the star wars franchise . these films did not rely on non-stop action or dazzling special effects , but rather on thoughtful , intelligent stories , intriguing `` what if ? '' scenarios , and astute social commentary . they included sci fi classics such as soylent green , the omega man , the andromeda strain , westworld , and others . while the shopping mall setting and some of the special effects of logan 's run are pretty cheesy , it is still an interesting film and its themes may be even more relevant in today 's botox era than they were in the 70 's . i have heard they are doing a remake and would like to think it will improve on the original . unfortunately , given the recent history of hollywood , it is more likely that they will drain every last bit of intelligence out of the story , and replace it with more explosions , and perhaps will smith .
0	curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website . yeah , at the cbs site you have sit through 4 commercials , but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs
0	the episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes . this one happens to be only 18 minutes . this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle . even though it only cost me $ 2 i still got jipped . let 's hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway . be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them
1	can watching paint dry be riveting , interesting , and compelling ? can looking at a beautiful woman who is naked for almost three of four hours long movie be not erotic ? is it possible to watch the movie where an artist creates sketch after sketch of his model in preparation for a painting and many scenes run in real time and not become bored but instead be totally absorbed by the painter on the screen and how he was progressing with his work ? jacques rivette 's `` le belle noiseuse '' is certainly not for every taste but i found it immensely rewarding . it is one of very few films where creative process with all its tension , uncertainty , selfishness and self-centering of an artist who once he began working is nearly oblivious not only to his model 's discomfort but to the feelings of the ones close to him have been shown on the screen with such truthful passion , technical excellence , and tremendous acting . michel piccoli as an aging painter edouard frenhofer , once famous and productive , jane birkin ( liz ) - his much younger wife and a former favorite model , and emmanuelle béart as marianne , the young , bright , and intensely intelligent woman whose presence awakened frenhofer from semi-lethargy and made him want to paint again were unforgettable . the film also explores a vital for any artist subject - what is more important , the process of creating a work of art or the result ?
0	actually , since a couple of the yuen brothers did the choreography for this movie , it is n't really ripped off . corey yuen kwai did the action for 'buddha assassinator ' and there is some sleeping style in this movie also , but i will get to the action in a minute . stephen chow plays the king of beggars . once a rich young man and great in kung fu , he gets cheated out of everything he should have had by a government official . he is now forced to become a beggar with his father . the main problem is that the movie just does n't flow together very well . there is just too much beggar talk . the story does n't move along at all except at the start and end . the rest is just mindless talking . this starts out like a kung fu movie , but when chow becomes a beggar , that becomes the main focus of the story . the action is very good when it does happen and i loved the sleeping style . sleeping style has been used in a few older movies and it was nice to finally see it in a newer one , but they could have used it more . the undercranking is way too fast but the fights are still pretty good . 2.5/
0	note : if you do n't want to know how the movie ends , do n't read this . ( i 'm giving you fair warning now , so do n't complain about spoilers later ) . the only reason i 'm mentioning the ending and the `` big secret '' is because i 'd like to spare you from the huge disappointment i experienced when watching this movie . when i first walked into the theatre to see this , i could n't have been more excited ; after months of waiting , i 'd finally get to see the movie whose preview had given me chills every time i saw it ! the movie started out wonderfully : great acting , scenery that could go from gorgeous to terrifying in a matter of seconds , and , at times , almost unbearable suspense ( that shyamalan really knows how to scare ! ) the story takes place in a small town in the 1800 's . at first this town seems like the perfect place to live : the people are friendly , the houses are cozy , and the scenery is beautiful . despite the peaceful setting , however , we get the feeling that something sinister lies beneath the surface of this sweet little community , something that frightens the villagers and keeps them from being completely at ease . every now and then , they glance fearfully at the forest surrounding the village ; nobody ever ventures into it , and a guard is stationed every night to watch over it . pretty soon , we find out why : according to the village elders , there are dangerous , hostile creatures lurking in the woods that will kill anyone who dares enter their domain . these creatures are supposedly unidentified monsters who are so bloodthirsty that the color red is forbidden in the village ( it attracts them ) . for years , the villagers and the monsters have had an understanding : as long as the villagers stay out of the forest , the monsters will not harm them . at one point , however , one of the creatures enters the village at night , leaving the villagers to believe that their uneasy truce may soon come to an end and more of the creatures will attack . while all this is happening , we ( the audience ) still do n't know what the creatures look like and half the suspense comes from wondering what they really are . it was halfway through the movie when all my hopes for the story came crashing to an end : there are no monsters in the woods . when one of the villagers revealed a monster costume and said the shocking words `` it 's all a farce '' , i still could n't believe what i was hearing ; it was all i could do to keep myself from screaming right there in the theatre ! after months of anticipating this film , of expecting a truly scary thriller , and of trying to guess what the monsters really are , there are no monsters ! disappointed does n't even begin to describe it . it got worse , though . the next big surprise was the reason the villagers created the story of the `` monsters '' . the villagers are n't really living in the 1840 's ; they 're living in a modern-day wildlife reserve . supposedly , the leaders of the village used to live like normal modern people , but when tragedy struck their families , they decided the real world was too much for them and moved into a wildlife reserve to start a new ( if extremely delusional ) life . the story of the monsters in the forest was created to terrify their children and keep them from wandering too far and discovering the truth . they even had the village retard dress in a costume and wander around occasionally to scare the other children and make them believe the monsters were real ! when the retarded boy died in the woods ( still wearing the stupid costume ) , the leaders , rather than mourning him , remorselessly saw it as another opportunity to lie to their children by telling them he was killed by one of the creatures . i basically went from sympathizing with the characters to being repulsed by them . what parents could lie to their children and deliberately terrify them like that ? i do n't think i 've ever been this disappointed in a movie before ; not only was it completely misleading , but the plot was pitiful and the adult characters were pathetic ( i 'm sorry , but i have no other word for people who are perfectly happy to live a lie and deliberately frighten and traumatize their children to continue living it ) . many fans of this movie have said that those of us who did n't like it `` do n't get it '' . i assure you , i did get it , and i did n't like it anyway . i 'm no fan of slasher films and i did n't expect this to be one , but i also do n't appreciate false advertising or almost totally unsympathetic characters . the two stars are for the cast and the filming . better luck next time , guys
0	have n't read the book , so ca n't compare , but the relic on film is simply pathetic . yes , it 's a monster movie . the problem is , this movie is no better than most of its genre , and worse than some . the monster looks like a refugee from one of the star wars episodes . the acting and dialogue are terrible . what a yawner !
1	i was about to buy the dvd since i found it in a store near home . i am glad i read the reviews and hope that the poor sound gets fixed for the dvd ... and that the poor reviews get deleted ( the ones about sound quality , that is ) . this is one of my favorite movies and i 'd really like to have a copy . i wish there were far more foreign films in this site . there 's a whole world out there that people do not understand because there is too much of the same around..
1	this is a monumental movie that helped to shape the identity of jamaica after its independence from britain . the character work is very good and the plot gets more and more interesting as the movie goes on . to top it up , the soundtrack on this movie is trully great . the only negative with this particular dvd is that it is slightly below par for a criterion transfer . having seen quite a few criterions , i can say that i was not particularly impressed with the quality on that one . i am sure though that criterion must have done the best they could with whatever `` raw '' material they had available
1	can the book reviewers please pay attention . this is not the book , this is the vhs movie section . i see many book reviews , but not a single movie review . i 'm glad everyone liked the book , but we need to see if the movie is any good here . i am sure it has alot going for it based upon the book , but i have seen some movies do a terrible job . what about this vhs movie ? has anyone actually seen it ? also can someone tell me how to get people to sell it for a reasonable price . used rental copies for $ 22 to 125 is outrageous . one can only hope it comes out on dvd and these scalpers lose money
0	back in the early 90 's , jane march made a big splash internationally with her uninhibited performance in the sexually explicit the lover . granted , the role did n't give her much to work with , but from a physical standpoint she made a big impression on a lot of filmgoers , including me . the movie garnered her a lot of notoriety and she had every opportunity to use that as a spring-board into a legitimate movie career . unfortunately , choosing the unbelievably stupid bruce willis vehicle color of night as her follow-up probably killed any chance at a career that she had . i 've always found erotic thrillers to be quite a dubious genre . most of the ones that i 've seen , while sexually explicit , are n't really erotic . nor are they thrilling in any way . this movie was following on the heals of the tremendous success of basic instinct and almost every studio was chomping at the bit to come out with something similar . as a result we ended up with some terrible films like sliver , jade , body of evidence and this film , color of night . the plot goes something like this . bruce willis is a psychiatrist who has a patient dive out of his office window , going splat on the sidewalk below . he is so traumatized by the incident that he loses the ability to see the color red ( ! ) . he decides to take a break by visiting his psychiatrist friend played by scott bakula and hanging out with scott 's therapy group . he hopes that he might be able to make some sense as to what has happened . scott 's group is a motley crew of screwed up people , from a woman who is nymphomaniac , to a weird androgynous young boy . bruce ends up meeting a beautiful young woman played by the delectable jane march and he quickly falls in love with her . we get treated to explicit scenes of the two of them screwing in the pool , the bedroom , the bathtub and the shower . meanwhile someone murders scott bakula and starts to wreck havoc with bruce . he tries to figure out if it 's someone in scott 's therapy group and on and on and so forth . the movie is really quite laughable due to the fact of how serious bruce willis was apparently taking this movie . virtually everyone else in the movie seems to have their tongue planted in their cheeks with their performances , but bruce seemed to think that this might be an oscar contender . add to the fact that the plot is absolutely atrocious and contrived beyond comprehension , and add way too many red herrings , and the movie quickly becomes a chore to watch . about the only thing this movie really had going for it was the explicit , but decidedly unerotic sex scenes . they really come across as more silly than anything else . the only thing that i enjoyed was getting to see a slightly older jane march in the buff and looking better than ever . what a smoking body ! but , like i mentioned before , she got a lot of the blame along with bruce as to why the movie turned out so terrible and as a result , she has appeared in very few movies since . i still think that if she had been given the proper chance , she could have been a great actress , but people have all but forgotten about her by now . it 's really surprising that this movie did n't kill bruce willis ' career . but i guess if he could survive hudson hawk bonfire of the vanities , he could survive anything . btw , the version i watched was listed as being the `` r-rated director 's cut '' with 17 additional `` steamy '' minutes added back into the film . since i never saw the original cut i could n't tell what might have been added back into this version . there is some fairly explicit sexual content and a shot of full frontal bruce willis nudity in the pool scene but nothing that 's too strong . avoid this movie like it was herpes . color of night is rated r and contains strong sexual content , nudity , graphic violence and strong language .
0	when a movie producer in 1998 foregoes available spectrum of colors and technology opting to feed his audience grain-black , white and jittery gray , the result had better be good . that fraction of members of the technicolor-drunk general viewing audience who will even stipulate to watch such a thing do so at decided perils of time and money , push play alongside mr. benefit-of-a-doubt and strain to see if it works . thus begins the argument of effect and more specifically , that of color . the problem with a black and white movie is that very few movies that resort to that , despite some grand intention , do not work , or , in the alternative , do not work as well . citing two examples - sin city which is near-tolerable acting paired with an absurd choice of black and white , tantamount to robbery , and good night america which is all and about the same . the dilemma with black and white productions is that regardless of how well it comes together , there seems always a thread of an argument in the back of one 's mind that if one must resort to black and white to make one 's point , one might be better served as a charcoal artist . color is the medium of life . from a budgetary perspective , black and white films save money as the 'challenges ' of color , which , in a good feature , can be excessive , are thus eliminated . yet complications arise - for instance - i was n't sure if that was blood or motor oil dripping from that guy 's hand . similarly , the entire cast in sin city could have been wearing hot pink , in shades of course , and we would never know . yet of course this is no excuse to dislike a movie - or is it ? one wonders , however , that , if pi production would have had more money , would they have opted for color ? moot point . it 's done . notwithstanding the obvious that i do n't prefer black and white movies and incidentally do n't know lots of people who do , pi , although a courageous artistic attempt with significant merits ranging from creative camera work , clever symbolism and high-octane guts , seems to lanquish for other reasons . despite pi 's visceral intensity which is delibertaely hot-wired throughout , spinning out scenes that sizzle the nerves , after max 's third or fourth headache it gives up the ghost . as as result , the movie stays earthbound , weighted down by a mediocre revolving-door plotline ( obsessing man chases number grail looking for key to life while beset by outside forces including the recycling feeds of his own troubled mind ) , unremarkable narrative with a gem here and there , failing repetitive effect and thin , uninspiring 2-d support cast , leaving the movie wanting for depth and intelligent character interplay . unresolved imagery and scenes lent the impression that this creative endeavor was a bit out of control and ad-hoc which is no fatal flaw in and of itself but in this case was signficantly detractive . despite a reasonably decent stockpile of cinematic victories the battle was n't won . the themes inspiring pi have excellent potential however this movie trafficked the runway like an antiquated flying machine - airborne one second , belly down the next . as a fine creative exercise , the creators are praised for their effort and bravery - pi is as bodacious as a skunk engaging rush-hour traffic and commands the watcher 's attention until that undefined moment when boredom sets in . contains subterranean theme seedlings which likely served as brain fertilizer for the subsequent more advanced spin-off - `` a beautiful mind ''
1	i purchased this dvd for my very passionate son 's 11th birthday . when he opened it his eyes filled with tears . he has loved gorillas , chimps , and all primates since he was very young . i watched the movie before and was a little concerned about his reaction to digit 's murder . it was as i expected , he cried in my arms . his dream is to grow up and move to africa to help in the survival of this extraordinary species . the movie was given to him for encouragment from ms. fossey with all her beliefs and struggles . we as the human race have a responsibility for all species on earth . this movie will open your eyes and make you realize how vain and selfish humans can be and it also shows that one person can make a difference and is still making a difference years after her death . what strikes me about mrs. weaver is that she was also touched by fossey 's accomplishments and she is an honorary chair person for the dian fossey gorilla international fund . dian fossey wrote this passage in her journal , `` when you realize the value of all life , you dwell less on what is past and concentrate on the preservation of the future . '' i hope this review helps you decide whether to buy the movie or not and brings at least one more person to acknowledge we must all do our part .
0	i used to think this film was okay but it 's really lame . he 's going home only cause he wants a car , shows you how greedy people in america are about christmas . they only care about the material goods they get out of the overrated season
1	i do n't have television , have n't for 11 years . when i learned cbs was allowing free viewing over the internet i checked it out and started watching episodes of csi , csi ny , csi miami , and ncis . i found ncis to be my favorite and this particular show dead and unburied is my favorite so far . i enjoy the light-heartedness of ncis . so i decided to download this episode from amazon unbox . i really wish amazon unbox would allow me to burn shows i 've purchased . as it is they are restricted to viewing on my computer . when unbox expands this service to allow me to burn dvds i will likely purchase many more shows this way . i like selecting individual shows
0	dear film company jackasses , surely you know we already hate you for your greed - why do you add insult to injury by taking fine films like `` the great santini '' and cutting them to full screen ? yet another fine film marred , no doubt , by some big company 's desire to cut corners . burn , hollywood , burn
0	i do n't understand what the people in charge of producing `` the wiz '' as a film , could get by joining the former `` big '' names of diana ross , michael jackson , richard pryor and lena horne in this trashy picture . the music soundtrack is by far , much better than the movie itself . i have lately become a great soul music fan , so i recommend to get the soundtrack album and enjoy it considering it just as a very imaginative soul music work , not keeping in mind that it 's a `` movie soundtrack '' . in such manner you will enjoy it more !
0	a poorly-conceived , poorly put together mess . do n't bother
0	this film was probably made not to entertain the audience , but more to show as much as possible the reality of the terrible agresion on bosnia . but it does so for a small part only , showing the bosniaks and serbs living together peacefuly before the agresion . with the begin of hostilities this film leaves its half-folkloral nature and becomes a pure propaganda movie of serbian nationalists . its attempt to blind the viewer , hoping he never watchs news or read a newspaper , is amaturelike and fails not only through its fake of reality , but also through poor cinematografic form . the dialogs are poor and the actors definitely not worth the theme of the movie . handfull of interesting phrases and few fleshes of situation are by far not enough to save the movie from the abyss . the handling shows several onlogical moments . and as a concept of `` we all suffered and we serbs did not start the war '' it only makes a serious and average informed viewer laughing . this movie does not entertain at all , and shows the events as unrealistic as any b - movie about vietnamwar . and about facts it shows only that there are very unserious and nationalistic directors and producers in serbia . my rating is absolutely thumb down . comparing with , for example , no man 's land this motion picture is failing in everything that makes movies about war a potential time window about occurences in former yugoslavia . instead to jump into the minds of people that participated the war , you can only get an idea of dogma that the director is trying to spread by making this underaverage movie
0	let 's face it . nothing anyone says can sway a particular fragment of this movie 's viewing audience one way or the other . those who love j.lo will declare the greathess of this movie , in a variety of ways . those who hate j.lo will counter their every point in describing how bad it is . and those who love quality film wo n't waste too much time even recognizing that this movie even exists . guilty pleasure , indeed ! one thing you have to admit about j.lo , she 's consistent . she sings bad , acts bad , and is merely eye candy , for thoe who find her appealing . and this movie is full of all of the above , plus awful , cliche ridden , emotionally pleading writing that should be an inspiration to anyone with hollywood writing aspirations , since this movie demonstrates how little talent it takes . at least it 's had it 's short , but sill way too long presence on the premium movie channels , cause for a while this piece of garbage was ubiquitous , just like the lead starlett . maniupulative only begins to describe this drek . but that said , it 's more than enough time wasted on this movie . i merely felt compelled to warn folks . do n't waste your time . it stinks
0	in case you 're wondering , the aforementioned 'suckers ' are anybody who paid to see this movie..and i dont mean just in a theater ... i count myself in because it cost me $ 3.79 at my video store ! looking back , i should have given that money to a homeless person , then went home and stared at a wall while playing suspenseful music ! i would have gotten the same effect of watching this pretentious piece of garbage ! this guy sucks ! ! seriously , his talent level should place him as a writer for the sci-fi channel ... maybe he could write a few decent outer limits or twilight zone episodes ? ? ..but he is in over his head when it comes to big-budget movies ... and where the f did the budget go ? has the the price of 'monster suits ' ( signs anyone ? ) increased to the multimillion dollar range ? my guess is he pocketed half of it and the other half went to the unwitting actors who 's agents suckered them into this sham of a film . if you read the 'quotes n trivia ' on amazon 's link you will find that ( a ) kirsten dunst bailed out on this sinking ship ( good thinking girl ) and ( b ) sigourney weaver had nightmares after she read the script ... obviously she had already committed.. spoiler ... . short summary of the incredibly unfeasible plot : a bunch of people from the city who have had deaths in the family do the logical thing and go live in a wildlife preserve ( although we see no animals in it ) , undetected by authorites , long enough to raise children , whom they traumatize into never leaving the village by dressing in monster suits and other scary tricks . anyone ever seen a scooby-doo episode ? then 1 guy stabs another and they send a blind girl ( with 2 guys we never saw before who wimp out immediately ) to go get medicine through the forbidden forest ( how she is supposed to acquire multiple-stab wound effective medicine is up to her ) ..but the 1st guy she meets gets it for her no problem and helps her back over the wall into the park ! and the cult lives on ... seriously..thats the plot . i 've read that he stole this plot from the book 'running out of time ' ... not to mention the scooby-doo thing , or his camera style which he takes from hitchcock ... this guy is a hack folks
1	i really did like this movie and the different kind of story . it was very imaginative and well acted . the story was very scarey at times and gorey as well . the only problem with the movie is that the director covered up ezra godden 's nude scene with a half shot of his butt in the begining of the movie . other than that , if you would like to see a town that prays to a fish god dagon that wants human sacrafices and the town 's people peeling off the faces of it 's visitors then this movie is for you
0	oh please - whoever has the rights to dub off the original 1972 masterpiece theater tv series of 'cousin bette ' do so and make it available on dvd . this was one of the finest shows ever created for television . truly , it totally eclipses the 1998 movie version and now , 40+ years later , i fear it will soon not be physically possible to render this production to dvd . for the sake of one of the theater ( and humanity 's ) most glorious theatrical efforts , please make the original tv version available ! ( btw - i rate the original item at 5+ stars !

0	do n't know about anyone else , but the dvd i purchased had lousy video . the only good shots were of closeups and sometimes it took the cameraman a few seconds to focus on a number of the shots . all of the long distance shots were grainy and not clear and the medium range shots were not good either . i know the concert was indoors , but i 've seen other indoor videos that did not have this problem . did i get a bad dvd or did anyone else have this problem
0	this is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen a must see so bad it is funn
1	i think this movie goes right to the heart of the philosophical question of what art and artists are supposed to be and do : are they merely to present facts/ideas/personalities/images with no comment , no moralizing , no personal ulterior motives ( leaving all those things to the viewer ) , or do they need to state clearly a moral purpose and certain direction ( which the viewer can then accept or reject ) ? martin sheen is kit , a garbageman working in south dakota ; he becomes friends with 15-year-old holly ( sissy spacek ) . when her father tells sheen he does n't want him near his daughter again , sheen kills him . the two run off together , living for a while in the woods like two `` innocents '' of some primitive society . but then they 're discovered by three men and sheen kills them , too . they now head for montana , sheen committing more murders along the way . he is empty inside , nothing fazes him ; he imagines he 's like james dean - misunderstood , alienated . but he does n't have a clue what he should be alienated against , and as far as being misunderstood , he never once gives the least hint there is anything there to understand . we finish watching the movie feeling as empty as sheen . i also felt a little angry at malick 's attempt to con me into thinking there is more to sheen 's vapid character than there really is : he truly is just a non-entity who kills half a score of innocent people . so back to my first paragraph . malick obviously works from the perspective of the first half of my question posed ( a view that became an obsession , i think , with artists , writers , film-makers , etc . beginning in the late 1960s ) ; i tend toward believing the second half . suum cuique

0	this title is the bootleg title for a film called the the ratings game . i 'm no sure why amazon is selling this on their web site . the quality of this dvd is terrible , i was suspicious when i got it . the dvd case and the dvd itself look like they were home made . having said all this , knockoff or not this is a bad film with a lot of big names in it . it 's like they were trying to make something campy and failed big time . i expected more of danny devito .
1	grand old movie , well acted , will watch many times agai
0	this film was dreadful . streisand is absolutely unlikeable . to enjoy this film , you would need to buy into the romance between streisand and nolte and i just ca n't see how that is possible . i could n't believe it when i found out how critically acclaimed this film was . along with the english patient , this is one of the worst 'critically acclaimed ' films i have ever had the displeasure of viewing
1	russians and yankees team up to save the world in `` meteor '' , one of the last gasps in the celebrity-disaster movies of the 1970s ' . ( like the `` airport '' movies - you 'd have a bunch of celebs tossed around for no other purpose than to have their headshots printed along a strip at the bottom of the movie poster . ) in `` meteor '' , a huge chunk of an asteroid , blasted out of its benign orbit after by a wayward comet , is now heading towards earth . called `` orpheus '' , the chunk is 5 miles wide and promises to kick off a nuclear winter on arrival . the only hope left are two space-based missile platforms lofted into orbit by nasa and the soviet union - each pointed at targets on earth rather than into space . ( i do n't remember if the platforms , named for hercules and `` peter the great '' actually violated any treaties , but their owners sure seemed keen on keeping them secret . ) the americans learn of the incoming asteroid first , having fatally positioned one of their spacecraft in the asteroid belt at the moment of the comet 's collision . they then learn that hercules is `` light '' -they 'll need extra missiles , and since they do n't have any time to put new ones into space ( and as henry fonda 's president puts it memorably , they ca n't just `` conjure some out of thin air '' ) they 'll have to go to the russians for help . waiting for orpheus to hit , the plot boils down to scenes of the scientists realigning their missile platforms away from earth , and other scenes showing the devastation wrought by smaller `` splinters '' . ( in an interesting move , there are n't any subtitles for the international targets . ) even if you find the special effects lame , the score annoying and the plot thin and holed as if it too was struck by a meteor , `` meteor '' surprisingly gets some good mileage from its stars . sean connery is great in a post-bond role as the civilian designer of hercules - a nasa fixture who resigned when his program was taken over by the military ( `` hercules '' was apparently designed just for this eventuality ) . brian keith is also great as dubov , connery 's russian counterpart . the script has most of the yankees getting along with the russians , so he 's never a foil for connery , but he gets some good scenes going from a genial to an enraged soviet , improbably speaking all his lines in russian . karl malden also rises above what seems like an incredibly unnecessary role as a nasa bureaucrat - he 's neither scientist , engineer or politician , but he keeps connery 's maverick in line . landau , a great actor , plays the thankless role of the cold-war hawk of a general who fears the russians more than shooting stars . the fx are actually pretty good for pre-cgi ( mostly excelling in the space sequences ) . the music seems repetitive , but laurence rosenthal 's score is also evocative of the russians and the oncoming asteroid . much of the movie drags on and many sequences seem redundant . ( did they need all of the `` splinter '' scenes ? the `` avalanche '' sequence is most ludicrous - the world is coming to an end , but there 's no hint on any of the faces of those out skiing the alps in that sequence . ) that said , the plusses and minuses of this flick make it memorable , and the plusses make it worth watching . the script places the control center for hercules underneath the old at bulding in tribeca , and i admit i ca n't pass the place without thinking of this movie
0	this movie was awful . that 's all i can say about it . it killed the book , which happens to be one of my favorites . when i got this movie after reading the book , i excitedly stuck it in my vcr ( yes , vcr -- no affordable dvd players at the time ) , i was expecting so much more than what i received . i know movies have to cut out a lot from the books to fit them into 2-hours , but i 've never before seen a movie cut out the main hero ! now , that 's just ridiculous ! if i were the author , david baldacci , i would be furious that my story had been so badly butchered . clint eastwood had to be the star , so he twisted the whole plot around to make luther whitney the hero , when in the book luther whitney is gunned down half-way though . in the movie , the book 's hero jack graham is totally non-existent . my advice to you if you 're looking to buy a good movie : look someplace else . read the book . *sigh* if only the movie would 've followed the book a little more closely ... it might have been a blockbuster hit . too bad .
0	my favorite show of the trek series but there 's no way i 'd buy another individual program from amazon . it will only play on their downloaded player ... wo n't burn to dvd so ca n't play it on my television . do n't bother buying this ... just go for the trek collection on dvd
0	first of all , i am a joy division and new order fan ; therefore , i tried to like this . really , i did . sadly , this film stinks . the focus is not on the bands themselves , but on the obnoxious character known as tony wilson . what a monster ! either it was the actor 's depiction or he does truly have a horrid personality in real life . maybe i 'm not british , but i did not find 24 hour party people to be very funny . only a few scenes made me grin . the randomness added very little to the overall quality of the film . in addition , the camera work was very jerky . looked like it was done by a novice ( and yes , i 'm one myself , having made two movies ) the only redeeming aspect has to be the scenes with joy division . too bad the members of this band are minor characters . i can only hope that the biopic of ian curtis currently in production will be much , much better
0	after watching this lame , stupid sequel all i can say is `` leave it alone already ! '' god this film sucked . first , after 25 years of trying to escape from brother michael , this is how laurie strode goes out ? ? ? ! ! ! major let down , it should have been more shocking and spectacular . second , while `` 20 years later/halloween 7 '' was made for lifetime , this one seems to have been made for mtv . all dimension films has done for this franchise since taking it over for part 6 , is give it style , no substance whatsoever . the only one of their 3 sequels that was remotely scary was 6 , fully due to bringing back the guy who played michael in 4 ( the last good halloween film ) george wilbur , he 's sorely missed but probably too old for the part now . third , i 'm so sick of rappers and models thinking they can act as is the case in this film with busta rhymes and tyra banks . no talent busta needs to stick to cursing and throwing his hands around to a repetitive beat and tyra needs to stick to walking a catwalk in some designer dress with her mouth shut . they suck . hopefully hollywood feels the same way since i have n't seen them in anything since , thank god . fourth , the story is just another retread with a new gimmick , the internet web cam . poorly executed , no suspense at all in this film . the film was originally suppossed to be released for halloween '01 , but they had to do reshoots to improve the film , unsuccessfully i might add , so it was released in summer '02 . funny , this film was directed by the same guy who directed `` halloween ii '' ( the best sequel ) . even funnier is the fact that they had to do reshoots for that one as well , but john carpenter did them and it did improve the film . his touch is sorely missed here . so , if dreadful acting ( except jaime lee curtis , but she 's only in the first 10 minutes , unfortunately ) , boring , dumb story and dialogue , shockless , routine kill scenes and no scares or suspense ( unless your 10 years old and have never seen a horror film ) if all that 's your cup of tea then by all means watch or buy this waste of time , money effort ( if there was any ) . it 's just another insult to fans of the original . and now , for next halloween ( '07 ) we will get `` halloween : the remake '' directed by none other than the man who brought us the classic ( not ! ! ! ) `` house of 1000 corpses '' , rob zombie ! i 'm also sick of bad singers thinking they can direct . the choice is refective of hollywood nowadays , style over substance , cool and trendy over timeless and great .
0	i dont wont to download it i wont it all on dvd this is waste mone
0	i am bewildered at the praise and adoration that is heaped on this terrible movie . to give an adequate measure of just how bad this movie is , it is only fair to review/describe it on several different levels . first , as mike judge films go , this is the bottom of the barrel . office space was hilarious in its simplicity , where the subtle sarcasm and deadpan rips on pop culture were well-timed , sufficiently developed , and acted out with talent . in idiocracy , the jabs at society and our 'dumbed-down culture ' ( regardless of how appropriate and accurate ) are a dime a dozen , with the vast majority of them falling way short of genuinely entertaining humor . i actually appreciate and am amused by the subject matter and the setting , but beyond that , this movie leave a lot to be desired . secondly , as comedies go in general , this movie stinks . i realize that judge wanted to , on some level , create a commentary on the self-destructive path that our culture is on , and i 'll even admit that the first 15 minutes were very promising . wilson 's character is funny in the same way as livingston 's character in office space ... he is a subtle simpleton who relishes in his blissful ignorance and laziness . however , beginning with the introduction of rudolph 's character , the movie begins its downhill plunge . she is not only not funny , she is downright annoying on screen . she over-acts in most of her scenes , leading most viewers in suspense as to when she 'll go away . her character , amongst countless others ( including dax shepard at his quasi-retarded worst and terry crews in a role that would make even the most avid randy savage fan cringe with his over-the-top-yet-still-not-believable machismo ) , is one of the weakest supporting characters i have ever seen . i found myself silently condemning the casting director throughout this movie ... not to mention counting down until it was over . i think that this is where judge 's latest offering falls [ way ] short : in office space , livingston is surrounded by an amalgam of genuine ( albeit nerdy ) characters who not only are tolerable , but in most scenes are actually as integral to the humor as the protagonist . wilson is talented , but even his drawling wit and everyman charm wear thin in this stinker . in addition , his agent should be shot for signing him onto this one without a better supporting cast . verdict : do n't waste your time . re-watch office space if you 're looking for some judge humor that actually elicits laughs
1	i absolutely love atlantis . from ronon dex , to sheppard , and to all the faces . i 'd cry if atlantis was cancelled . seriously though , steve should have never have died , he should also have been put in command of sg1 . can you imagine that ... '' why steve , welcome to earth ... you 're welcome to live out your life , if you only feed in self defense on enemies ... 'kay ? oh , you 're also in charge of sg1 . : p '' but seriously , the wraith make this show so awesome . from steve to bob to edward , to gordon and alexander , to michael and eric ( by far james 's best performance yet ) . the wraith make this show what it is . but one thing ? ? ? why do n't we have before i sleep ? seriously , you have no idea how irked i am at that , since i began watching in s.2.12 . anyways , i think atlantis totally pwns sg1
1	this is an hbo remake of the original 50 's 50 footer . naturally there had to be some adjustments for the new era . however it still captures the thrills and chills . you may also marvel at the spandex clothing that stretches for ever ( rats . ) nancy ( the little woman ) does not have quite the devoted husband . here life is not quite ideal . soon a chance encounter with aliens ( the space type ) leaves her feeling bigger about the situation . 50 foot bigger . now it is nancy 's turn for a little revenge . the ending is a little unnerving . be sure to see daryl in just as serious of a role in `` high spirits '' ( 1998 )
0	i saw this movie about two weeks ago and i ca n't believe how disappointed i am for this . i was expecting fireworks ; instead i got a truckload of bad karma on my head . not only that but it maybe the most over-the-top film i ever saw and it will be on my list of the worst movies i ever saw . to begin with half of the characters die in this film and i was like 'what is the meaning ? ' then there 's the film 's signature moment in which sinatra wakes up from his nightmare and they do it in such a matter that they put his face right at the camera . again i said to myself , 'what 's the point ? ' and then there 's the chilling climax which would be totally ripped off a year later by the kennedy assassination-from the scoped rifle right down to james gregory 's character getting shot in the head . in one of the documentries to this dvd director william fredkin says that there is no doubt this movie caused lee harvey oswald to kill president kennedy because 'oswald realized that he was raymond shaw . ' if he 's right that raises the question : did he do it by his beliefs or did someone push him over ? then fredkin ends his obseravation by saying that the release of `` the manchurian candidate '' and the death of president kennedy are the two events that made the 1960 's what it is and why people today ( including me ) are still obessed with that decade . in conclusion , i think this was a big disappoinment . and this movie is on the list of afi 's 100 greatest films ? please .
0	filmed in 1933 , this movie is in black and white , and might be considered dull and slow-moving by today 's standards . an accurate chronology of the six wives of henry viii , the characters of the wives are rather undeveloped , and the movie does not delve very deeply into the important religious and political questions around which the marriages centered . a good introduction for those who are unfamiliar with the basic story , but the serious scholar will want to conduct further research
0	i picked up the book at a yardsale without knowing much about it , and absolutely loved it ! it is so smart , funny , and heartbreaking , without ever being sappy . so , naturally , i was curious about the movie too . i figured that because ephron had written the screenplay too , not much could go wrong . and while the story line followed the book more or less , the movie turned out terrible . i could not have been more disappointed ! ! first of all , jack nicholson is completely miscast , because he essentially plays himself ( as usual ) , not the *interesting* guy that mark is supposed to be . he is the opposite of charming , funny , tender , lovable , i.e . somebody that the character of the wife ( rachel ) would fall so deeply in love with and trust so completely . you suspect all along that he is a cad ; therefore , rachel 's utter shock at his betrayal does n't make sense . besides , he is too old for the role ! meryl streep is annoyingly twitchy , but much better in her role as rachel . still , she ca n't carry the movie alone , and her love scenes with nicholson are flat ; there is no spark there . i wonder how happy ephron was with the movie adaptation of her novel , and whether she really did write all the scenes . the wedding scene , where rachel has doubts about marying mark and spends what feels like 5 hours in a room alone agonizing , while the wedding guests wait , is out of place , not to mention boring , not to mention heavy handed . a total dud
0	after two hours of watching it , i still do n't know what it was about . yes , the scenery is fantastic , but a national geographic film would have done more . i applaud the acting of milla jovovich , and nastassja kinski . but , the kudos reviewers have given to peter mullen would have been better deserved if this were a silent movie . i hardly heard anything he said and there are no english subtitles offered on the dvd . as for wes bentley , that 's acting ? he kept the same expression when he was having sex as when he was having a gun pointed at him , or a co-worker being blown to `` kingdom come '' ( that 's a pun based on the movie ) . he makes clint eastwood look like laurence olivier . the film is supposedly based on a thomas hardy book , but very loosely based , and the scriptwriters should have at least used cliff notes to have learned more about the story and the character development . they obviously fell asleep after the first couple of chapters and made up the rest .
1	dino made a number of westerns , everything from the comic western pardners with jerry lewis , to a whodunit western , five card stud with robert mitchum , to playing an alcoholic lawman in rio bravo . but martin had a field day playing the villain in rough night in jericho , a hard-bitten , violent movie . martin plays jason flood , an ex-lawman who has taken over the town of jericho . george peppard and john mcintire plays former lawmen as well , who have been contracted to provide a stage to jean simmons , who flood is trying to force into going into business with him . flood is also an ex of simmons , which makes him even more determined not to let peppard and mcintyre help her out . things get increasingly violent until the final showdown , where the blood flows freely . everyone is good in this film , fro mthe three leads to mcintire , who was always superb , particularly in westerns , as well as the great slim pickens as one of flood 's henchmen . rough night in jericho is overlooked , but it 's very entertaining
0	mortal kombat : annihilation is one of those films that is so bad that it actually hurts to watch it . from the nearly complete recast of almost all of the characters ( odd , considering that in interviews after the first movie , all of them said they 'd want/ be willing to come back for a sequel ) , to the horrible ( even by 1997 standards ) cg effects , to the cliched fight scenes ( gee ... two women in a mud pit . i bet it took them all night to come up with that one ) , virtually everything that could have gone wrong with this movie did go wrong with this movie . loosely based on the story of the mortal kombat 3 video game ( and set immediately after the first movie , which , while not great , looks like citizen kane compared to this stinkburger ) , the movie set about the lofty goal of depicting shao khan ( played by brian thompson , the alien bounty hunter from the x-files ) and his army ( shown in most scenes as a small band of extras . oooh ... scary . ) as they attempt to take over earth by merging it with the alternate dimension known as outworld . this merging of realms will result in the destruction of humanity . with only a week to do anything about it , lord raiden ( played by james remar , replacing the , and i ca n't believe i 'm saying this , much better christopher lambert in the role ) once again enlists the help of liu kang ( robin shou ) , sonia blade ( sandra hess ) , and princess kitana ( talisa soto ) , along with help from a select few other characters from the video games ' crowded lineup , to prevent this from happening . the story in and of itself is not necessarily bad . however , given the film 's obviously low budget the weak screenplay , the loss of most of the excellent cast from the first film , and most jarringly , direction even more inept than that of paul w.s . anderson , it quickly becomes clear that they set their sights too high , only to have practically everything come crashing down . the only saving grace of this film is its killer soundtrack , featuring an updated version of the theme created for the first movie , as well as music by kmfdm , megadeth , rammstein , juno reactor , and others . if ever you 're looking to punish yourself for something , then by all means watch this movie . however , if you actually like yourself and want to remain on good terms with yourself , you will avoid this movie like the plague . believe me , you 'll thank yourself later .
0	we have a lawman who for no explained reason starts to investigate the cause of death of a man with 500,000 on him and it all goes down hill from there . there is no rhyme or reason to the story . i gave it two stars because the landscape is great
1	... then this would be a really serious detective . as it 's executed now , it 's a superbly relaxed copper-gets-the-villain with serious undertones . cool
1	easily one of the funniest movies ever made . its incredible today to realize that irene dunne never won an oscar , and this year is the most galling of all , as she lost to the ridiculous luise rainer in `` the good earth '' ; and even more galling to realize that cary grant was not even nominated ( after all , its only a comedy , right ? ) but this is a movie that will never age : it makes me laugh as much today as when i first saw it on television thirty years back , and if id been alive to see it in a theater 70 years ago , the response would be the same . dunne and grant excel as a divorcing couple who sabotage each others new relationships , and randolph scott is a miracle as dunnes new fiancee ( `` not oklahoma city itself ? ! '' ) . but it is irene dunne who is the star here , and until such time as `` theodora goes wild '' and `` show boat '' are finally released on dvd , this is the best of her 30s roles .
0	i imagine this movie might be funny if you 're really into dog shows . i 'm not , so i could n't tell you . mediocre at best . `` this is spinal tap '' was better
1	i really love bones . it has everything : suspense , drama , humor , pretty people , fun storylines . i have yet to miss an episode , and even into season 2 this is probably my favorite . it adds depth to all of the characters . also , the winter holidays are my favorite time of year . i like holidays that are about what is good in the world . bones is about people standing for the good in humanity even though they explore the very worst every day . i cry through half this episode , but in a completely good way . buy , watch it , love it . but watch it with a friend if you do n't want to cry alone . so moving , great performances by the whole cast . emily deschanel was powerful in this one , she brings real vulnerability to brennan here . david boreanaz , as always the perfect sympathetic hero , loveably old-fashioned . cute , funny moments . touching , poignant moments . this really is the best of what is great about bones

1	flesh and bone is an evocative , haunting and rewarding study of a drifting man ( played with understated , heartbreaking perfection by dennis quaid ) who encounters a lost soul ( meg ryan , outstanding ) leaving a violent marriage and begins a tender relationship until a dark figure from his past shows up . plotted an as slow burning thriller , this is really more of a complex and intriguing character study of guilt , father-son ties , violent crime and doomed love . flesh and bone is a bleak but supremely well crafted film that reaches a truly sad ( though inevitable ) conclusion . the final moment between our two main characters is incredibly moving ( in a very unsentimental sort of way ) and a scene that i will never forget . i didnt mind the major plot twist as its no more unbelievable that a dozen of hollywood 's most praised suspense thrillers . the spare , atmospheric photography ( set in a desolate , bleak texas ) is exceptional and thomas newman 's suberb score will get under your skin . for those who wont something altogether deeper , affecting and more emotionally satisfying with their thrillers ( or love stories ) , flesh and bone should be ripe for rediscovery .
1	what can i say if you like clint eastwood your going to like this movie . i have not seen this movie since it played at my local drive-in ! what memories
0	i reviewed the subtle subversiveness of the sinatra version in an earlier issue . how does the update stand up ? well , once they moved the setting to iraq , cleaned up the muddy surrealism , sobered up the star , and played it straight , there was absolutely no subtlety whatsoever to the political message . like dropping a bowling ball on a birthday cake . or chinese cinema . `` we will tell you what to think . '' the locals might mistake it for a documentary . i quit watching after 30 minutes . you just ca n't carry an entire movie with a `` fake war hero via hypnosis '' plot . no movie should hinge on a single plot point , and if it does , please do n't make it a boring one . no disrespect to denzel washington intended . he played frank sinatra so well that co-producer tina sinatra probably got goosebumps . and what a waste of meryl streep . she did a great job and it did n't matter . but hey , one of the beauties of watching dvds in china is that i do n't blow three hours ' pay on each movie . as a brief aside , show one flew over the cuckoo 's nest to 155 chinese students . this film refuses to tell them what to think , and that confuses the hell out of them . then they ask you , mr . teacher person , to explain the film 's message . um , it 's about your school , but i 'm not saying that .

1	it is truly a pity that the western has died off . they are rare and far between these days . a few years back tom selleck and sam elliot made a few together and separate . they are all worth seeing . this one has tom playing cable , a confederate soldier who has left the war early because he knows it is over and the south has lost . it just has n't been declared yet . his family and friends thought him to be dead , and the reunion seems a bit shaky . his wife played by suzy amis , is a tough as nails no nonsense frontier woman that knows guns well from her fathers gunsmithing business . eventually she works things out with her husband cable and it is a good thing he has her to back him since she is great with a gun . even though cable believes the war is over he finds sympathizers trying to enlist his aid in the confederate cause but he shuns them . when he is accused of murdering a retired union officer he must track down the real murderer and bring him to justice . the production values are excellent and the acting , directing , sets , and music are all top drawer . good dvd quality but no extras . if you enjoy westerns you should find it very entertaining . if you like it be sure to see `` crossfire trail '' and `` conagher ''
0	oh the humanity ! ... first , the obvious : tara reid as cybill ? i do n't know who in the film industry owed whom a favor , but it is a mystery how that happened . secondly , dominique swain just did n't act like the andrea marr of the book . it seemed like dominique swain did n't even read the book before she played andrea . i also happen to think that she is a very poor/mediocre actress all around , but that 's another topic . the movie did n't have any similarities with the `` feeling '' of the book , even though the plot was ( roughly ) similar . portia derossi as carla ? ummmm ... . maybe ? selma blair as darcy sort of worked . the only character i felt was well-cast was todd sparrow . anyhow , i re-read the book a few more times since seeing the movie , to try to recapture the feel of the book ( and erase the memory of the movie )
0	if you got elvis presley and dodie marshall and put them in the same film you will have easy come easy go , an elvis presley that people who like boats or sailing or both will love . but anybody that hates boats or sailing and is an elvis presley fan will be un-happy . and elvis ' leading lady in this film is dodie marshall which i guess is a re-make of a film with the same name came out in 1947 . and this is one of final films that elvis sings the same song with somebody else , and the song is yoga is as yoga goes . he sings that with elsa lanchester who plays a not very nice yoga teacher . if you are an elvis presley fan , then buy or rent jailhouse rock on video or dvd

1	in the sequel to `` john carpenter 's vampires '' , derek bliss ( jon bon jovi , who takes james woods place ) is a professional vampire killer who has been assigned to terminate the vampire queen in mexico uma ( arly jover ) . along the way he assembles what terns out to be the most montley of crews in vampire hunting history . zoey ( natasha wagner ) , a girl who is strung out on vamp blood . a priest who has n't quiet taken his vows yet . and last but not least a black redneck mercenaery . guys , this is what it is . actually it is n't too bad . bon jovi is not the world 's greatest thespian ( his antics in concert are amazing though ) . do n't quit your day job , jon . but he still has a certain charm thaat gets you through the film 's rough spots . arly jover was cast because she looks good naked , period . this is a low budget film , but vet horror director tommy lee wallace knows how to make it streach and give us a good time . just do n't be looking for high atr
0	i like japanese films , and really wanted to like this one . however i must say there are a lot of confusing parts to the plot . now i have read this is going to be part of a trilogy one day . if that is true i might give it a higher rating . as of now however , there are just a lot of things that do n't make sense
0	for that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of his/her dirty secrets covered up . i feel that it 's the most insulting film to be released . it hides the fact that we as citizens , and our government do n't really care about who we stick in office . if the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up . i ca n't fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time , and believe me i do n't feel it 's right to air it all over the news either . i feel that it comes down to the man , and if he does have the values his/her party believes in then he will do the honorable thing , and own up to his/her mistake . this movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it 's alright to cover things up , and there are no absolutes , or rights or wrongs . wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who 's rich ? do we wait until then to change the moral ? that 's pathetic , and so is this movie
1	oh yeah ! this is the film which set the standard for the women-in-prison genre . the big doll house has everything you could possibly need if you are wip junkie : cat fights ( one even takes place in the mud ) , group showers , sadistic guards , scantically clothed gun toting babes , lesbianism , torture , and pam grier . oh yeah !
0	so this movie is made of 2 stories . the first one is quick and involves takeshi kaneshiro and brigitte lin . both have their stories and i actually found kaneshiro more interesting . so this thing ends and the movie should have also . it should have been a 30 minute movie . so for the next hour or so we get to watch tony leung chiu wai sit around his apartment in his nothing but a white tank top and his briefs . wow , what a movie . the only positive to the second story is the girl who listens to the same song all day . she was fun to watch but i still wish i would n't have seen this dumb movie .
0	my favorite show of the trek series but there 's no way i 'd buy another individual program from amazon . it will only play on their downloaded player ... wo n't burn to dvd so ca n't play it on my television . do n't bother buying this ... just go for the trek collection on dvd
1	while i recently called `` ballad of cable hogue '' my favorite sam peckinpah movie , this outre take on revenge is undoubtedly his best , and imho one of the best of the 1970s . for those who havent seen it , the setup is the daughter of ( presumably ) mexican land tycoon has been impregnated by one alfredo garcia ; the angry dad offers a huge reward to whomever delivers to him the severed head of alfredo , and down on his luck bum warren oates ( think a seedier version of bogart in `` sierra madre '' ) is hired by a pair of `` entrepeneurs '' ( gig young and robert webber ) to do the dirty work . the irony : alfredo is already dead in a car accident . and that is the setup for where the movie really takes off in a spin of revenge , justice , betrayals , love , -- all against the sight and smell of the deteriorating severed head rotting in 100 degree plus heat . oates was always an underappreciated actor , but here he gives his best performance , matched by mexican actress isela vega as his doomed girlfriend . not a movie you want to watch frequently , but it is a masterpiece .
1	i wo n't lie . this movie sucks . however , it is so cheesy and lame that it will make you wet your pants . i do n't care what people say , but i like the no-name actors and the wanna-be power ranger ninjas . it is a great movie because it is the worst movie ever . also , i must add that the action was utterly stupid and the acting was absolutely pathetic . : ) great movie , though . yes , i will agree , the plot sucks . however , there is no plot , therefor the movie rocks . buy it now and own the best movie ever for two bucks used and new . it 's the corniest and cheesiest movie ever ! :
0	i wish i had read the other reviews first . though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch , the episode cuts off after 22 minutes . obviously , i already know the ending of `` the black death '' , but i still wanted to see the full show
1	i wanted it for my collection , however you can sift through all the youtube stuff and end up with the same video for free if you want to do the work
1	i have loved this movie since seeing it upon its ' initial theatrical release . many sleepless nights ( and views ) later , i was able to begin to make some sense out what jacob singer was going through . as listed in the other reviews , this is not a movie for the 'casual ' film-watcher , as it requires the viewers ' full attention . the imagery is amazingly suggestive without being overt , and is one of my favorite elements -- -what you 'think ' you see may sometimes be more psychologically terrifying than what you actually see ... but , this is not a horror film in the strictest sense , although it is horrifying , considering what jacob singer experiences . i am amazed , even here in 2007 how well this movie holds up in story , cinematography , acting , and general flow . it works itself into your brain and sets off a bomb inside , making you `` live '' through the mind of the protagonist , feeling his `` ascension '' ... if you 've not seen this movie , then you 've missed a real treat , but prepare yourself -- -do n't watch it until you 're mentally prepared , and certainly do n't watch it if you 're depressed already -- -this ai n't no `` feel good '' , `` happy times '' movie ... and , if you 've not seen it in several years , then watch it again and take your own climb ... or descent ? ? ?
0	this movie was awfull . supertroopers was awsome and beerfest was even better , so i suppose they can be forgiven for this cinematic abortion
1	i have owned the video for several years and just purchased the dvd . hannah and her sisters far exceeds anne hall as my favorite allen picture . such a joy . and the dvd is wonderful
1	i seen it a few months back then , to my dismay it was on again the same time as raw , but instead i recorded it anyways . it does a very good job of creating a nightmare orwellian future , without making the people seem too paranoid for the most part . the scenes of the president talking on tv were very powerful . it strongly reminded one of a `` big brother lite . '' yes there is violence and a love story and rebels risking their lives for a better future . some favorite moments : 1 . the girls running out of the clinic 2 . the guard and dog patrolling the quarantine 3 . the rebel leader screaming for guards there was a negative present ( which is punishable by getting shot on the premises ) 4 . the extremely moving ending and the new rebel leader awesome flick you do n't wan na miss , trust me .
0	dear film company jackasses , surely you know we already hate you for your greed - why do you add insult to injury by taking fine films like `` the great santini '' and cutting them to full screen ? yet another fine film marred , no doubt , by some big company 's desire to cut corners . burn , hollywood , burn
0	totally disappointed ! ! ! i love woody allen , love his films but - dvd-s are coded for us market and are not possible to be viewed on our european dvd -s total waste of money you should have warned me on that barbara kalas , architect from croatia
1	dvd newcomer `` fort apache '' ( 1948 ) looks great , with minimal wear on its crisp black-and-white images ( from original nitrate elements ) and bugle-brisk audio . the film , ironically , finds henry fonda playing the maddeningly hawkish cavalry commander against john wayne 's humanistic officer willing to risk all for peace and justice . the ( single ) dvd has no documentary on the exciting and heartfelt film , a shame . it does include a 15-minute piece on monument valley , covering ford 's significant and seemingly beneficial role in the indian reservation 's history . the navajo , paid good wages for their appearances , called him `` giant soldier . '' `` i 've kissed more babies than a politician , '' ford said . `` part of his vision of the world was that we 're all very small in the scheme of things , '' film historian joseph mcbride says . `` i think ( monument valley ) gives a dimension of moral seriousness to his work that was intensified as he went along .

1	dexter gordon is dale turner , an ex-patriot jazz musician living in paris and playing nightly at the blue note . ( his character is based loosely on lester young and bud powell , but mainly it is all dexter . ) a young frenchman ( francois cluzet ) idolizes him and later befriends him . dex has problems , mainly booze , and between blowing gigs seems most concerned about how to get something to drink . the cliche of the self-tortured jazz musician who 's got to find something new to say on his horn every night is , of course , the main focus of the film . ( that this is the only way to greatness for a jazzman is the great myth for the artform . but it sells . ) dex gets homesick for new york , returns , falls into his old habits , misses the flight back to paris , and soon dies . the movie is overly long , but gordon is mesmerizing . dexter speaks slowly , as if from behind a veil ( gordon was ill at the time and living in obscurity in mexico when he agreed to do the movie ) ; he had much input on the film , creating his own dialogue and insuring accuracy . the picture has faults , to be sure , but it 's a mighty achievement nonetheless . the music , of which there is plenty , is , of course , top-notch

1	doctor who materialised without his tardis on this , my first timelord download in the amazon unbox , which is much larger on the inside than it appears on the outside . for a very reasonable sum , $ 1.99 , my family and i were able to enjoy the first third doctor adventure after his regeneration , where he encounters the nestene conciousness . the down load took only a few minutes although i had some considerable difficulty installing the microsoft program . thanks to the good people at amazon tech support i was able to obtain an alternative download from the gates empire itself which allowed me to enjoy our rental . a great experience and will not be the last . easy to navigate and fun for all the family . someone should tell the timelords on gallifrey about unbox and perhaps they could get rid of all the old type 40 tardis '
1	prior to watching this , i expected something on par with `` striptease '' or `` showgirls , '' which are films about stripping that also attempt to legitimize their titillation by tossing in dramatic subplots . even with earnest intentions , films of this sort usually end up being clichéd and disappointing . adding to my trepidation was the fact i had never heard of this film , which was released in 2000 , prior to 2006 . i finally took a chance on it and gladly admit that it really drew me in and convinced me to care about the characters . like most people , these women only want to find love and something real in life , yet have lost their centers . indeed , it is the actresses ' portrayals of these characters that make each disappointment and set-back so painful to watch . sandra oh really moved me with her performance as jasmine , a would-be poet who sabotages her own happiness because she has come to believe she can not trust anyone , including herself . her performance as a sensitive , intelligent person is the most tragic among these lives because she lacks the confidence to escape her current situation , even though she easily could . as angel , darryl hannah is wonderful as a helplessly dim and hopelessly optimistic dreamer . ( she also looks unbelievably fit ! ) jennifer tilly is also very good as the out of control jo , a woman who tries desperately to win in a man 's world , but comes to realize the playing field is not level . charlotte ayanna is remarkable as jessie , an eager to please naïf , who has not yet had her spirit crushed by the weight of the world . come to think of it , it does all sound very clichéd and there really is n't much of a plot to tie it all together , just several subplots . nonetheless , the acting is exceptional , made all the more impressive by the fact much of it is improvised . ( and yes , the ladies here all smoke , which would ostensibly account for their trim appearances ) i enjoyed the entire two hours and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good character study without the hindrance of a plot . the dvd is quite decent , with a very good transfer , optional subtitles and some alternate scenes . this is a bargain for the price .
1	it 's a great human being , mr. elvis aaron presley , and his talent is real in this funny movi
1	this movie is a classic . we owned it on vhs and the tape finally fell apart , so i ordered it for our family for christmas . good for all ages , nice night of entertainment for all of us
1	the characters are likable , there is some decent progression and growth seen over the course of the film , but only about half of the scenes are necessary . it seems as if they just wanted to give gene wilder a few more chances to be quirky . gene is a funny guy , there is no doubt about that , but enough is enough ! the film is family friendly , except for a few instances of harsh language and violence , but it is really nothing compared to the sorts of things that get into theaters these days . it is worth a look , but only if you 're willing to deal with some pretty decent stretches of time when there is not a lot of progression in the story
0	i downloaded it and i could n't view the video paste the intro . then i re-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file , but it again it only had sound and not video . this one is a waste of money
0	i loved the book and made the mistake of buying the movie without watching it first . this movie is boring and did no justice to the book
0	this has got to be the worst film i 've ever seen . its not sad . its not funny , jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage . i do n't have any sympathy toward nick in this movie , because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him . the actor is the worst of all . i cant tell if he 's sad in some seens , or angry or jest retarded . i 've seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks , i guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present . it probably worked better back in 96 ' . but this movie is so so so bad . its embarrassing . do not rent it or buy it or view it on television . note 's : this film had some great talent a song from olivia newton jon , and ( one of my most personal favorites ) mila and my favorite comedians margaret cho . she 's to good but ... why this film , she ( and mila ) are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this .

1	words can not express how glad i am the adventures in motion pictures company made available matthew bourne 's swan lake on dvd . the cliché thing to say is it 's `` amazing '' , `` genius '' , `` sexy '' , `` masterful '' ... but it is all those things and more . you 've never see anything like this . to me this `` modern '' swan lake is now the definitive classic of a classic -- i ca n't nor do i want to imagine the swan roles as anything but manly now . the leads adam cooper and scott ambler are not only great dancers , they are great actors . their chemistry is enjoyable to behold -- and just as believable as the chemistry the traditional swan lake man/woman pair conveys . in fact , a male swan is more provocative *because* it 's not the typical sad , delicate princess from all other versions . instead we see something new and wonderful -- a true creature of beauty , power and majesty who utterly captivates the prince ( and the audience ) in every way . the male duets and solos in this show are just ... wow . i brought this dvd to my best friend 's house and i was unsure what she would think , she 'd never seen any ballet let alone one so un-traditional as this . my fears were put to rest in act ii . once the swan appeared she did n't take her eyes away the rest of the night . we both watched in silence as if mesmerized . it was a fantasitc feeling to watch it with someone else and see them be amazed . the music helped too , swan lake has by far some of the best music ever written for the stage . surely many people who are n't normally ballet watchers would appreciate this show -- its humor , universal themes of forbidden love , the unique way the swans look and act like real birds , and above all else powerful manly dancing -- definitely something for everyone ! share this with someone you love , quick ! !
1	this episode is a classic , and is one of the best in the series . it explores time travel and alternate time lines , and it 's storytelling had paved the way for many screen plays that followed .
0	i ordered this the night of the oscars . i will assume the mad rush to make as many dubs as possible was the reason for this atrocious copy . there was n't even a booklet or insert of any kind included in the packaging . it looks like a bad vhs transfer . i should have returned it , but it would 've been more trouble than it was worth . i thought the movie was everything it was cracked up to be - but unfortunately , in my case , i have to add : buyer beware .
1	seriously , one of my favorite movies of all time . thank goodness for 1980 's rewinds . kate hudson 's character is ridiculous , in the absolute best sense of the word . oh , and , martha plimpton never ages ... she 's a freak of nature . now get off the computer and let 's go party risa garcia style . f*** yeah

1	darkness ( for those who wonder what the title film means ) is not the only time of the day tenebre 's would-be victims should be afraid of when a psychopath starts imitating the murders of one best-selling author 's latest creation . before you can even say what the -- , this 1982 horrorfest has already delivered the goods with style and flair . never has it been more fun to witness the untimely premise of its cast . with a touch of ingenuity from its director and a killer-score to boost , tenebre is a strong and inspiring piece of film that is a definite must-see . undoubtedly one of the best efforts of dario argento 's career. -- -- -martin bouche
1	a very funny and insightful examination of young adults all looking for love , happiness and meaning . the film takes place on new year 's eve , 1981 , and follows many different young people who somehow all eventually end up at the same party ( which the hostess later wakes up to find she slept through . ) elvis costello makes a cameo and provides a running joke in the last third . the soundtrack is great -- all late 70 's early 80 's pop and new wave . and the one who steals the show is dave chappelle as the cab driver who manages to give a ride to practically every character at some point , dispensing equally silly and profound wisdom along the way , on everything from friendship and destiny to life before an afro and how to `` get booty . '' ( smiling at a girl is very important , as is avoiding talking about death -- '' everyone knows they 're gon na die someday , they just do n't want to hear it from you . '' ) ben affleck is very amusing as a clueless suitor . oh , and courtney love was actually bearable . all in all , a very smart , enjoyable ride
1	eyewitnesses are given too much credibility and are notoriously inaccurate . conspiracy buffs have fashioned an industry out of events told and retold but this footage is the best witness . it is also horrific to watch . i had heard the parkland surgeons all talk about a head wound behind the president 's right ear . they should know , they were there right ? the film shows otherwise . if there is a conspiracy it is a well kept secret , show me someone who can keep a secret . if the us government is hiding evidence why is this footage available ? no one can tell where a shot came from by the target 's movement . the answer to where jfk 's missing brain is here , the third shot pulverized it , turning it into a red mist . had this film never existed the conspiracy people would have made millions more but the answers to their questions are in this footage . this is history which can not be retold by bad historians or knuckleheads . see for yourself
0	this was my first download of this type and also my last . i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare . there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless . the machines keep freezing up . the idea is nice but the technology is n't there yet
0	the first half if they had made movies back then , in 1871 , it would move as slowly as this . perhaps that date suits the film to perfection . the days of utter simplicity , with nearly nothing happening . where maybe days are filled with yourself . not distractions . after half an hour , all i could think was , if this was on tv , not only would everybody switch off , the sh** ( show ) would be axed . it may even beat so many foregin movies as the slowest movie of all time . but slow really means empty . the other half ( of me ) yet i have since come to learn , by others ' reviews , this is a movie which you must make , by the mood , or the feeling of dread others speak of . or else you are left with the feeling of dead . i failed to do that , and without that , the film fails miserably i reckon . perhaps because i am dead . so , therefore , i envy those creative creatures of subtle senses . or whether it was because they were so simple , or easily pleased , which means more modest , more modern . so , as in real life , it 's only the feeling which makes anything real . my first ( or worst ? ) half the other part of me thought that , the film being a feature length , they think they can just not try for half an hour , an hour . such is the problem with many filmakers , even today . when , being a torture , err feature , they should try much harder ! ! therefore the atmosphere spoken of in these reviews can only be like saying there is smoke without fire . virtually nothing happens , and what does makes little sense , as any unconcious creation . my better half of the schizophrenic but the acting of the lead lady is expressive and genuine , and not being stereotype ; is pleasingly real . weird as suits the role . as are the others natural , with no hollywood posing . how often have i heard that story - good acting , bad film ? oh i 'm sorry , i did it again . the only thing exciting is the title . the whole my conclusion is : i do n't know which is my better half , and which is my worst half . . . ? so , all things being unequal , i choose both . i stand and fall by both my views . ( i guess that 's why god gave us 2 eyes . ) i was going to give it only one star* at first , but now i give it merely two** , knowing i 'm still mean . i see this movie as perhaps the greatest measure of one 's temperament . if you feel better than me , are supernaturally sensitive , or have the patience of a saint to me , add one , two , or three more stars respectively . i intend to watch it again , and then maybe i can give a before and after shot . please feel free to reject me , write negative comments about me , or scare me . or kill me .

0	i thought this movie was decent but nothing spectacular . it kept me awake but just on the verge . the few comical scenes helped to keep me interested as did the totally unexpected ending which was probably the best part of the entire movie . i thought the acting in this movie was just mediocre at best . overall i was not impressed with the movie but the few good scenes earned it two stars over just the lonely one star .
0	sorry but i totaly disagree with all these positive reviews.i 'm a fan of war classic films but this one is a mess.nothing is moving , action is zero and filming is poor . we are very far away from dirty dozen , battle of the bulge , midway , enemy below etc ... . a total waste of time and money
0	i bought this dvd because a friend said it was one of the funniest films he had ever seen . we 're still friends , but i 'll never listen to one of his reviews again -- our taste must not be compatible . my wife , daughter , and i seldom agree on anything but we unanimously consider this the worst movie we 've ever seen . it 's the only movie i 've ever turned off before the end . on the plus side , watching most of this film has given me a new perspective on cinema . i used to think i knew bad movies . now i know that most movies are at least pretty good , and it 's only a very few that are truly bad . this is one of those very few bad films . best in show belongs to a genre of `` comedies '' that i find boring at best , but often cruel and mean . other films of this type are `` waiting for guffman '' , `` bottle rocket '' , etc . if you enjoy watching pathetic people struggle then perhaps you 'll appreciate this movie
0	an accessible story with all the elements of a great american novel was somehow transformed into a perverse , worst of the worst abc afterschool specials . if you had not read the book , you would be unable to follow what was happening . some of the worst directing and editing i have seen in a long time . the original evil dead , with all its flaws , is a better put together film than this one . this movie is flat-out painful to watch . you get no justifications whatsoever as to why the characters behave as they do . it all seems so random . read the book . if you see this movie in a rental store , just move along , please , nothing to see here
0	i have friends who might be into this stuff , if only because they like the old and the strange . me , i 'm just like -- is this `` it 's a wonderful life '' ? i think i might have enjoyed this more if it was a novel or maybe if i picked up the script . as it is , this just barely seems to translate into a movie , and -- forgive me for i have my own opinion -- '' city of angels '' was a good movie . too bad if you do n't like all this `` contemporary nonsense . '' i feel like it worked . my opinion : it 's long , it 's boring , it 's hard to hear . even if it has a message , i just ca n't relate to it . so maybe that 's my problem . your opinion : your own . keep it . you 're lucky i gave it two stars
1	i can not believe how mean and down-dirty elections can get when they get too close . does it tell us something about the election process . it needs to become kinder . democracy can be great if we work a little harder at it . it can be done ! it would have been nice to see more opinions of those on the right ... the film did seem to have a bit of a biased edge to it , like it was pushing an agenda . good awareness piece though .
0	this movie made me sick to my stomach . here we have a woman like nora ephron , a woman with professional job skills and talent and when she marries , she turns into a needy , desperate women whom evidently believes her own self-worth is determined by having babies , one after another . i ususally love all of meryl 's movies , but i could not stand seeing her turn into a needy , always pregnant `` homemaker '' . if i were a man , i would have run awary screaming , too
0	i love nature and cowboy movies . jeremiah johnson was on of the best movies i 've seen . it is unforgetable . it was my favorite robertredford movie . he did very little talking talking in this movie , he just acted , his best performance ever . the movie deals with the american indian also , in a profound and touching way . this movie is engrossing and based on a true story , it 's simply the best . do n't miss the opportunity to see this movie , it is a classic . it truly is in a league of it 's own .
0	three years after the first mortal kombat film , fans could n't wait for annihilation to come out . unfortunately , the sequel did not do well at the box office and after viewing it , i can see why . first , i will start with what is positive about the movie . kitana had more of a role as did jax , i preferred sandra hess as sonya a little over bridget wilson even though she did a good job with sonya 's character in the first movie , some of the fight scenes ( jax vs. cyrax , sonya vs. mileena , liu kang vs. baraka , sub-zero vs. scorpion ) were sequenced good , the dvd bonus features were nice , and the soundtrack was awesome . these positive aspects , however , could not save the overall film from disappointment . so what went wrong ? like the first mk , annihilation attempted to blend two mortal kombat games into one movie ( mortal kombat 3 and ultimate mortal kombat 3 ) . unlike the first mk , however , the blend was not successful . too many characters were put into the movie and therefore the character development for most of them was almost non-existent . aside from that , only three of the actors to my knowledge returned from the previous movie though it is understandable why the other actors did not return . what else went wrong with this sequel ? some of the acting was either over-the-top and/or downright pitiful . shao kahn 's character along with raiden 's character was poorly resembled . also , some of the characters did n't even get much screen time at all . one flaw that is immediately noticed at the beginning of the movie is that one of the main characters gets killed off ( i wo n't say who because it is probably obvious ) . while some of the fight sequences were good , most of them were rushed and some were just flat-out ridiculous . this goes double for the animality sequence . sadly , mk annihilation does n't rank up with the first one . despite all this , there is some good news . after eight long years of waiting , a third mortal kombat film will hit the big screen with most of the actors returning from the first movie . plus , the third installment will not only kontinue where the first left off but will also ignore the events of annihilation
0	okay , so to catch up on this exciting new series , i decided to try this revolutionary downloading program - amazon unbox ! i selected the first 10 episodes and hit purchase . minutes later , i was watching the first episode , it came quickly , sounded great , and looked wonderful ... however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end . forgiveable , until ... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video , making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing . but , this is a good concept ... unfortunately , amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality ! so , until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds ... do not try and download season 1 , episodes 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 ! ! ! 1 , 3 , 8 , 9 , and 10 were the only ones that were 100 % complete for me
0	years after its release i find myself writting what i consider a completely biast review for this film ( being somewhat of a star wars fan had made it difficult to look at it with any negative light before ) . let me first start by saying that my two daughters love the film . for me , i grew up watching the original star wars ( now titled episode iv , a new hope ) . when the original star wars came out , it changed the way people looked at sci-fi . i saw it several times just to be able to focus on the different aspects of the sets , props , costumes , etc . it was the best eye-candy of its time by far . substance became less of an important factor and if the movie had a couple of `` holes '' in the story we forgave it and watched-on mesmerized by its visual splendor and the likability of its characters . almost thirty years later the panorama is completely different . star wars movies still hold the bar for special effects but in a computer-generated world , amazing visuals ocurr within any television comercial , even the lowest budget sci-fi television show has special effects that are somewhat convincing or at least cool to look at . effects do not make a movie and `` attack of the clones '' is more about effects than story or even acting for that matter . awfully silly dialogue does n't help it neither . in retrospect , i wish that george lucas would have come up with two completely different droids than c3po and r2d2 ( the latter even flies ! imagine that , more capabilities than in the future ) . this premise is even absurd for the world of star wars . according to the story , luke skywalker and his uncle owen in episode four bought two droids that are about thirty to forty years old . as i 'm typing this review i can imagine myself typing it with a royal ribbon typewriter , that just would n't happen . it is scary to find things that are even too far-fetched for the world that lucas created but the movie is full of them . he does n't really give any explanation in the whole trilogy ( i , ii , iii ) as to why in the future the ships are not as cool or look and act clunkier , or why everything looks dated thirty years from now . in his world technology goes backwards and not the other way around . i , however have a solution for all these . george lucas should keep meddling with the original trilogy until all that is left from the original films is the faces of the protagonists . everything else should be computer re-generated in order to keep pace with a future more in sync with its past . then , you could buy all versions of the original trilogy ( iv , v , vi ) . as originally shot , the revised version that we all saw in re-release on the theaters , and the `` ultimate enhanced version '' to better match the second trilogy ( i , ii , iii ) . maybe he could even re-edited where the actors look as if they had no personalities and change the dialog to sound more confusing . then , you would have a whole set of six films that look fantastic but lack in every other aspect of story telling ( ie. , compelling characters , continuity , interesting plotlines , etc ) . the only reason i give the movie two stars is because the wonderful effects created by ilm still makes the film worth watching at least once . otherwise , i rather watch `` serenity '' which has a more star wars feel to it than this star wars film . the nickname of `` mannequin '' to `` annakin '' is well-deserved as it is any negatives regarding the characters of this poorly told story
1	hey if you have all seen the works of argento and fulci then you probably understand how illogical giallo is . this was not always the case and some of them come across as quite alright in the end . i would actually recommend this argento 'primative slasher ' over fulci 's `` do n't torture a duckling '' - not anywhere near as good as its giallo hype , this version of the bird with the crystal plumage i watched was uncut and a lot more violent than the pg version that has less murder violence , but is still dark all the same . although i give this five stars , it is more of a three star movie , but this is the one that started a whole cult wave of stuff like this , and for that it is recognized and prized , but you have seen better argento and giallo , i recommend that you get susperia before this . i say stay away from `` do n't torture a duckling ''
0	i did not like this movie . i know that times have changed and it would be revisionist to hold this movie to millennium standards of sexual conduct and infidelity . nonetheless , i found it very disturbing : his lack of concern for his wife and children , how the wife was unsympathetic and one dimensional , and how absolutely de rigueur it was in the sixties for married men to have `` a bit on the side . '' and what about her kids ? apart from the first scene we never see them again ; she instead seems to spend all her time cooking and keeping house for a married man . i 'm not a prude , really , but this film left a bad taste in my mouth
0	richard pryor is my all-time favorite stand-up comedian . i consider him the best in the business . but his performance in live and smokin shows he 's still just a rookie . he 's nervous in front of the camera , and says so several times . his material is typically raunchy , but not very funny . you can hear the forced laughter from a few members of the audience . buy this tape only if you 're a die-hard pryor fan , but do n't expect the side-splitting laughter you 'll get from in concert , live on the sunset strip , and here and now
0	i 'd give this movie a negative star if i could . avoid this movie . it 's terrible . not one positive thing could be said about this movie
0	to begin with the movie tootsie is classified as a genre of romance and comic.this movie is produced in new york . the protagonist is michael dorsey and he is the most important character in the film.the situation of this movie is of a man that is a talent actor but for reasons of money he decides to dress like a woman.for the reason that he can not continue woring in the job he has and that his manager tell him nobody would hire him because he is unemployed by that time . so there is where dorothy appears and he starts working as a women is a soap opera in televison where he becames so famous . he gets the job here but he did it without having the intention of hurting anyone and also anyone in the place knew that he was a man dresses like a woman.in addition he falls in love with one of the woman that works with him in the soap opera . thre is only one friend that knows what he is doing . he has one problem and is that his bestfriend falls in love with him but he did n't treat her well for the reason that he is in love with the other woman.the characters of this movie are really good actors evryone seems to knoe what they are doing.the way the character acts in the movie is ok and the decision the man takes to wear women 's clothin instead of try to find a job in the way he is seems to me very intelligent . because he could only accept that he was unemployed but no he decides to do something so that he could work . the stes in the movie are really well done and i like the part where the father of the woman that acts in the ospa opera gives a ring to dorothy without knowing thta she was a man.the lightnoing is was ok in every scene you could see everything ok and well iluminated . the costumes the actors used where a little diffrerent form he ones we use right now but eventhough they were not the same they look ok.furthermore th emusic they put inspires the movie to look more interesting , there were not that much music but it was ok . this movie could be reall in life because sometimes when people dont have jobs or they got fire they do everything they can to have a job . i will really recommend this movie to my audience because itis interesting to see how his man do all that work with enthusiam and it really leave us a message of life .
1	in the mid-'50s , columbia released a trio of nifty black-and-white `` monster '' movies : it came from beneath the sea , earth vs. the flying saucers and 20 million miles to earth . aimed squarely at the youth market , each of these films run less than an hour and a half , and are brave and spunky as they feature a human race that always survives and is better as a result of the battles with the monsters . most importantly , each has spectacular special effects by the master , ray harryhausen . in the years before computer-generated graphics , monsters were either created by very sophisticated cartoons , or , in the case of harryhausen , a technique called `` stop action , '' in which models would be shot a frame at a time ; natural movement was suggested by moving the figures slowly , frame by frame . this was time-consuming , painstaking arduous , and for non-fans , pretty cheesy . but the cheesiness is , in a way , more than half the fun . populated by such grade b through z performers as hugh marlowe , faith domergue and william hopper , these movies are a comfy as a pair of old slippers and a well-worn robe . these quick morality tales are a hoot and holler ; a campy , yet and faintly embarrassing , art form that demands the cliché `` so bad that they 're good . ''
0	the man died as he lived a loser . this uneducated thug was nothing more than a racist piece of crap . plain and simple truth . the only praise he deserves is praise that he is dead . thats one less racist thug off the streets . a two year old can write better music than he did . heck calling his stuff music is an insult to music and musicians every wher
1	to say this is a great film is probably an overstatement , but it certainly is a great idea for a film . gibson looks good , weaver looks good , hunt acts good , weir directs good , and the script is better than good . much . it 's a movie about ideas , which earns high marks these days , as so few flics can make that claim . sure , it stumbles a bit , and the ending is purposely frustrating , to carry forward the theme of white guilt and `` what then shall we do ? '' beyond all that , it 's sensual , and unpredictable , and pretty damned intelligent . seen anything lately in the multiplex that fits that bill ? i ai n't . see it for yourself .
1	jorge sanz ( a looker ) stars as a soldier deserting from the spanish army during the 1930s civil wars , taken into a family , who proceeds to fall in love with and seduce all four daughters , while forging a father/son relationship with the patriarch . touching and kinky and off beat , a worthy winner of the oscar as best foreign language film in 1992 .
1	it 's a beautifull movie . one of the bests to watch with your girlfriend . hghly recomended
1	i have always loved this movie , but especially love the music used in the soundtrack . it lifts the soul
1	tangled is actually a really good movie . you have to pay attention or you 'll get lost in the plot but other than that it was a great movie
1	i came to this film after rave reviews from friends , so perhaps i was expecting too much . there is much to admire here ; the acting is top-notch , the contrast between chatty characters and completely silent people in the opening interview scenes is well-crafted , and the plot premise itself is a fascinating one . for me , films are all about endings , and i felt in this area after life did n't quite pay off . i did n't really buy into the romance , and wanted to know more backstory about the female character so i could care more whether she gets the guy or not . i also thought they could have cut it a bit more - it feels 10-15 minutes too long to me . however , these are minor criticisms ; it is a film i will watch again , and recommend to japanese film fans , especially those who like the more slow-paced japanese films such as eureka , moe no suzaku and sonatine
0	the ones that are posted twice do not work . if they are posted once , you can try to download it , but it might not work . the video only worked for about a minute . shame , since i really like this show and i wanted amazon unbox to be cool . the one cent csi works , go download tha
1	i bought it on amazon a few days ago ( i saw the movie a long time ago but just now bought it ) and got it today . the movie is awesome . nick nolte and martin short make an awesome team . the story is probably the best part of the entire movie . it 's about an ex-con named lucas ( nick nolte ) who just gets out of jail and immediately gets involved in a bank robbery commited by ned ( martin short ) . there are so many funny scenes on here . here are the funniest ones : 1 . they think ned ( martin short ) is giving birth ( he stuck a teddy bear up his shirt to make it look like he was pregneant ) 2 . when doctor horvath ( kenneth mcmillan ) gives his story about lucas ( nick nolte ) ( tells about the `` hunting accident '' ) and there are a few more . there is even a bit of drama in the movie , most of it involving ned 's daughter , meg ( sarah rowland doroff ) . this movie is perfect . i recommend it to everyone . if you have n't seen it yet , you must see it now . because if you do n't , you 're missing out
