1	pupsqueak is wonderful . i am a picky mother about toys . i hate toys that are too loud , too commercial , too cheesy , too useless ... i have high standards . but pupsqueak gets my `` picky mom seal of approval '' wholeheartedly . here 's why . i am very blessed to have a mother who loves to send my children lots of goodies . while it 's easy to know what to send a 4-year-old with distinct likes and interests , it can be harder to gauge what a twelve-week-old baby will enjoy . we have no shortage of toys and gadgets to entertain our new daughter with , and she clearly enjoys some of them , kicking legs , cooing , , waving arms , etc . the pupsqueak , however , took it to a different level . she loves this thing . we showed it to her around 11-12 weeks old , and she immediately reacted . she laughed , she kicked , all the signs . then , she reached for the little black and white patterned bone that hangs down . we were so excited , and she 's had it attached to the bar on her carseat ever since . the real test , however , was our 10-hour drive from louisiana to kentucky for the thanksgiving holidays . but pupsqueak came through for us with flying colors : anytime she would get fussy , i could reach back and shake him a bit so he would jingle softly , and she would be happy again . after my arm would get tired , i 'd make sure he was adjusted where she could get at him , and she would , at not yet 4 months , bat at it herself . pupsqueak is a wonderful toy with a soft , gently jingle for young babies and a funny bark that even makes my four-year-old laugh for older babies . he is definitely top dog in my book
1	love these . i use them everywhere . i really ca n't imagine not having them , since my son throws down all plates and napkins still .
1	i purchases this basket for a friend . i was very pleased with its usefullness style . it arrived in two days of ordering
1	very efficiently drains about as much milk as i can get with the pump in style advanced for me , and very portable and easy to clean . i use it when i have a little more time or when i do n't expect to pump more than a couple ounces ( between feedings ) . despite medela 's warnings , i would say you could use this to pump daily , aslong as you are careful to fully drain the breast ( massage ) , but maybe not okay for maintaining supply for multiple pumping in a row
1	our son got these blocks when he was 2 months old . my husband enjoyed them more at first , but by the time our son was 5 months old he loved playing with these ! he probably could n't hold on to them well until he was 5 months old , so that is why he enjoyed them more at this age than earlier . at 10 months , he still enjoys playing with them . they have lasted through `` both '' children . i would highly recommend these blocks for infants , and so far even into the toddler age , he enjoys playing with them
0	i have three kids , and for the third time , i am utterly dissapointed with avent 's product . with each new child , we bought a fresh supply of bottles , hoping avent had fixed this problem . we really wanted these bottles to work , as they seem to be the most durable and stylish ones on the market , and our kids never had any problems with the nipples . however , each time , we ended up having to switch to another brand . the leak is not just a spot here or there . it is often a torrential downpour , leaking out the sides of the white cap . i know many people who have had the same problem . for as expensive as these bottles are , i would think avent would take more pride in their product , fixing such simple things as a leak . do n't waste your money
1	this product is good for your knees , however the suction does not seem to stay on well and the elbow part keeps slipping ... other than that it is good to hold small items like the toothbrush and toothpaste
0	my 15-month-old son pulled these off ( and broke one ) within about 5 minutes of installing them . also , he was able to turn the covers which ended up turning on the gas . bad design . do n't waste your money
0	i thought this would be a great idea to keep the jars in , but really , it took up too much counter space . i ended up putting it away and putting the jars into all the nooks and crannies in my cupboards as i personally do not have the space to waste for something that is completely unnecessary , i found . save your money
0	this is the flimsiest gate ever . to boot it is not cheap . i could n't even use the screws that came with the gate . i had to use nails and duck tape . the instructions were wrong about sizing it up to fit your area and it took me over 1 hour to put it together . unfortunately when i bought this gate , there were only 2 reviews posted - one was good and one was not so good . so i was a little confused but i needed a swing gate . so needless to say - i wanted to make sure that i put my comments on so that no one else will get swindled . this gate is n't even worth $ 1.0
0	first of all the diapers get stuck in the lid , and then the room starts to smell like baby poop . yes you can use reg bags for it , the only + about it . first day after changing the bag it smells ok but buy the 2nd wow it stinks so badly and when you open it to change the bag the smell is unbearable .
0	i ca n't begin to convey the frustration i felt when trying to use the refill . i struggled for 20 minutes trying to slip the too-tight bag over the cartridge . the diaper dekor works wonderfully as a single-use item , but at about $ 30-40 a pop , it is the most expensive garbage can outside of ted kozolowski 's apartment . the printed instructions were clear -- it 's just that they product does not do what it supposed to do
0	i just bought the dora folding potty seat today at walmart . it does n't cover the entire toilet seat . it starts at the front of the toilet , and does n't go all the way to the back . the result is that there is no support in the back . my daughter is 3 yrs , 4 months , and this seat is much too weak for her . any movement she makes causes the potty seat to sink in the back . i 'm afraid that if we use it , it will soon break and she 'll fall in . she definitely ca n't sit back , or even sit straight up because it sinks so much . i 'm returning it and i 'm going to look for something else
0	well , i just tried the bundle me ( toddler size ) with my 20-month old in our jog stroller for the first time today and i am disappointed because it is definitely already too small . he really ca n't sit in the bag unless his legs are bent , which he hates . plus , when i have the bag pulled as far down as possible in the stroller ( the only way i can get him in at all ) , then it only zips to just above his waist -- definitely not high enough to really get warm and snuggly . i 'll keep the bag for baby # 2 , but i 'm really disappointed i ca n't use it with my not quite 2-year old .
0	i 've used the diaper dekor since the birth of my now 7-month-old daughter and i loved it to begin with . very easy one-hand use -- step on the pedal , drop the diaper through the flap , very easy to tie off a bag when it became full . in the beginning , it handled odors well too ; even smelly diapers did n't cause problems . but as soon as i started feeding solid foods , things changed . it proved completely incapable of containing the ghastly stench of those diapers . my daughter 's room is at the top of our stairs , and the stench did n't just fill the room , it flowed out her door and down the stairwell , so we were treated to a powerful whiff every time we walked upstairs . i took to leaving her window open and the fan on to air out the room during the day and emptying the pail before bedtime at night in order to prevent it from stinking up the house . that lasted a week -- i just bought a new pail ( a diaper genie 2 ) and i hope that works better
0	i do n't know who jj cole made this hat for , my daughter had the tiniest head and it still did n't fit . waste of money
0	the problems i had with this gate : 1 . the instructions for using the template to install the hinges , for the fixed gate , was not easy to understand . i finally gave up and i improvised . doing so , the installation went more smoothly . 2 . the gate is not sturdy . if anyone were to bump into it , i 'm pretty sure it would break . 3 . the mechanism to click/unclick the lock is more difficult than it should be . fortunately , the people who will using it , have a strong enough grip to get it to work . despite these flaws , however , this gate does serve its purpose , in my case . i bought this gate to keep my dogs confined to a room -- - which it does . they do n't go near the gate , so fortunately , i do n't have to worry about them leaning on , or jumping on , it . as for the locking mechanism , it 's annoying , and i 'm just hoping it does n't get any worse . this gate would not be safe for kids
1	i bought this seat because we have a small eating area in our kitchen , too small for a full-size high chair . the seat has worked wonderfully from age 5 months to now age 21 months . i do find the seat hard to recline or sit up but i have only had to do that a handful of times as once you find the right setting for your child it stays there until he/she is ready for the next setting . the cloth lining is very easy to remove , wash , and put back and the plastic under the seat cover is easy to wipe clean . the tray is easy to put on , remove and again wipe clean or wash off in the sink . i have also found the seat easy to take on and off the dining chair when i need the chair for entertaining others . my daughter has never complained about sitting in the seat and , now that we are no longer using the tray but still using the seat as a booster , enjoys having her own place at the table . i highly recommend this seat for parents looking to conserve space in their dining areas but not sacrifice convenience or comfort .
1	the review before this one is what got me interested with this produce and so i decided to buy it and let me tell you , it was the best choice ever . i have no real experience with any other wipes , but have read reviews of all the promes other have given like wipes dry out or turn color ... that does not happen with this one . i love that i just put the whole pack in , plastic and all , and it stays nice and toasty for my son 's bottom . he loves it and no longer has to deal with cold wipes anymore . i love the spring inside to keep the wipes on top . i love that it heats from the top . the wipes never turn yellow and is always moist . i also love the little handle on the top , so i just have to pull the plug and easily carry it to another room if need be ! the product is hight recommended
0	once we took this net out of the box i knew it would n't work . our balcony railing was not only longer , but shorter in height , than the net so we had to wrap it around the top railing . the `` strings '' used to secure the net did not look strong enough to me and the whole set up looked ridiculous . i am searching for an alternative
1	we were just at the baby store to choose carseats and the britax marathon carseat on display had a gogo babyz travelmate attached to it . it was so easy to maneuver that my 7 year old daughter wheeled her 20 pound baby sister around the aisle for fun . two large , solid , screw-in knobs attach the travelmate to a backplate that secures the seat . the whole combination looks very sturdy and relatively easy to use . we bought both the marathon and travelmate . we were looking for a better alternative to the sit 'n stroll . this may be it . i can not compare the two options as i have never tried the sit 'n stroll , only read the so-so reviews .
0	these slipcovers are tooooo expensive to fall apart after one washing ! i bought two of these ; one ripped and the other is coming apart from the inside . i constantly have to cut the strings : - (
1	my husband is a nyc doorman so we found it very fitting to decorate our son 's room in this theme . since my hubby deals with taxi 's and limo 's on a daily basis we thought it was very cute that the main theme of this set had those things in it . we also love manhattan and are there often so we brought a little bit of it out to our house in l.i . the set is very well made and i like the fact that since it feels like it will last , my son can grown with it . it is also not too pastel and babyish that he can use it well into his toddler and pre-school years
1	i bought this portable tent for my graco pack n play because my toddler can climb out of it and i wanted him to be safe . we use this when visiting friends and relatives and it provides me with 100 % peace of mind knowing that he wo n't be able to escape and injure himself . it is easy to attach to the portable crib and holds very securely . my only negative comment is that it 's a little difficult to put together- i usually keep it assembled and throw it in my trunk to save time and my sanity .
0	i bought this for my three yr old and it does not work at all . we have the britax roundabout carseat and there is not enough room for the pillow . i returned it
1	i have this monitor now and i 'm thinking about return it back cause although i have the volume on high but still my baby 's voice still not clear but other than than it is a good monitor i did not have any problem with the battaries or stati
0	my seat is brand new and i love it , but it has already quick working . i 've changed the batteries reapeatedly and it still only works occassionaly . it wo n't vibrate at all and the music only plays sometimes . very disappointed .
1	i am nursing our 2 wk old , and it is just easier for me if our baby sleeps with us . my husband is always worried he will roll over on the baby , so , he does not sleep well . the snuggle nest has given him peace of mind and now he can sleep . also , the dvd has made him more comfortable taking care of the baby by himself , because he feels confident that he can calm our baby down without my help . i only wish we would have bought this with second child
0	even though i think this is a very good idea ( no mess to clean up like there is on a roaming stand-alone potty ) , the ring does n't fit our toilet seats well . we have the oblong seats , not the round ones , and the ring slides back and forth , especially when my 2 yr old daughter tries to get up on it . it does n't make her feel very stable so , so far at least , she has refused to use it
1	my son loves these blocks . we 've also purchased the number blocks to go along with this set . he loves saying the colors , numbers and stacking them
0	not only are probe covers unavailable in retail locations or over internet , it seems that first years has discontinued the product . at least the product is not listed or mentioned on their website . we searched for model 4290 - the number imprinted on the bottom of the thermometer . apparently , they do n't see any value in telling customers the product was discontinued . furthermore , the site is full of broken image links . the thermometer works well but without probe covers , it 's not a good investment . you can find equivalent products with readily available probe covers . if the store you 're buying the thermometer at does n't have covers there , find another product with covers available
1	this stuff works wonders for my son 's sensitive bum ... and fast ! we usually see results in just one application - usually by the next changing the irritaion is gone or nearly so . it also has a very natural/herbal scent which further outweighs other barrier creams . it may seem a little pricey on a per ounce comparison , but i 've found that i do n't need to use as much , which makes that argument mute
0	i bought this chair because it got such good reviews and looks great . i was so sick of seeing fish , butterflies and primary colors all over our house - the neutral tones were a sight for sore eyes ! but i 've been so disappointed in this chair 's function . with all the nooks and crannies in the buckles and straps , it 's impossible to keep clean . the straps and parts of the vinyl seat became so caked with food that i threw them into the washing machine - even though the tags says not to . the worst part of the seat is the tray . it 's ridiculously wide -- too big for my dishwasher and my kitchen sink ! ( and both are full sized . ) the way my toddler smears food on the tray , there 's no way i could just wipe it with a rag and be done with it . washing it turns into an exercise in hosing down my countertops with the sink sprayer . oh well , at least they get clean too ... also , i agree with other reviewers that it 's really difficult to slide the tray into place . i wind up shaking it around and my poor toddler looks at me like i 'm torturing him . on the bright side , the recline feature is wonderful for infants and babies who are just getting the hang of sitting up . overall , if i had it to do over again i 'd pick a simple fisher price..
1	i 've been co-bedding with my 5 month old son since he 's been with us , but we recently decided to move to a co-sleeper to give my husband and i a bit more space . i have friends who used it and read all the amazing reviews so it was a no brainer . we 've run into a few problems : first we have a modern platform bed that is low to the ground and even at it 's lowest the co-sleeper is several inches to high so we 've had to switch bed frames for now . second the co-sleeper mattress is rock hard and actually sits down about 4 inches from the divider- since i 'm used to having him in my arms for night nursing i did n't want to have to reach in and pick him up . we solved both of these issues by purchasing 2 portable crib mattresses . now he has a softer surface to snooze on and i can simply slide him over to nurse or roll myself right up to him ... we 'll have to remove one of the mattresses once he 's a bit bigger so he does n't fall out , but for now it works ! hope this helps ! *** i 'm adding this a few months after use- i like the idea of the extra space offered by having the co-sleeper attached to the bed , but our son is now 9 months old and has actually slept in it only a handful of times ... still prefer to have him in the bed with us !
0	i love this swing because it goes side to side , she can sit when awake , lay down when asleep , and once you put her in she is out cold . after 6 weeks of using it i thought the battery was going , but when i changed the battery the music was still slow and i still had to keep the swinging motion on high , two weeks later it just stopped working . i 've only had it for two months and hardly use it , just a total of 3 hours a day give or take a few
0	i 'm currently in the process of adopting my son , and i bought this to take to guatemala with me when i visited . it never worked - it did n't matter how much water i put in the chamber , it would never cycle on more more than 30 seconds . i then had to wait approximately 5 minutes for it to cool back down before using it for another 30 second cycle . i ended up filling the ice bucket with hot water , and letting the bottle sit in that to warm up . needless to say , it 's been sent back . i think i 'll just use the microwave when the baby gets home - it 's got to be easier and quicker than this thing
1	these are really good bottles . i have been using them for 4 weeks now for my newborn son . my only complaint is in regard to the stage 1 nipples they come with that you are supposed to use for newborns . the flow is much too slow . my little boy could not get anything out of it and he tried and tried . so if you plan on using these bottles , i would recommend going ahead and using the stage 2 for your newborn baby . i am not the only person who has had this problem with the stage one nipples . other than that , these bottles are great
0	does n't dry your bottles at all . it leave a condensation and does n't dry completely . i give it one star for all the stuff it holds , but water leaks out so you have to put something underneath it .
1	we got this chair as a baby shower gift , which i registered for and absolutely love it ! i do n't understand the problems the other reviewers are talking about . if used properly , this chair gives absolutely no problems . the seat locks in at different levels , if it 's not locked in , of course it will fall apart . the seat is easy to use , folds easily , and cleans easily . we store it in our van ( we have stow-and-go storage ) and it fits perfectly ! we 've used it since my son , now 16 months , could sit up . he lays his body from side to side and the seat does n't budge ... very safe . the tray does snap off easily , and he has done that at times while trying to climb up on it . this does n't bother me , since it 's not a 'toy ' and should n't be climbed on anyway . the tray has n't snapped off while in use , and hopefully wo n't ! we 've used this chair on both a chair , and the floor when seating was limited ( like at family get togethers ) . we have n't had any problems at all . anyway , i highly recommend it..
1	my daughter recently had her second child , and spends alot of time breastfeeding . this product allows her to pump at her convenience . she can have others hold and feed the baby while she spends some time with her other child . the product works very well . she said it takes a little bit of experimenting and adjusting to get it set to work best for her , but it is an excellent product . she previously had a less expensive product by another manufacturer , and heard how good the medela brand was from a friend . this brand is a pleasure to work with after using the less productive , noisier pump she had before . we would highly recommend this product , and the product is well worth the price paid
1	i 'm the mother of a 3 1/2 month old baby girl . i had intended to only breastfeed for the first year , but it turned out that my daughter had a very difficult time at first with latching on . so much so that she ended up taking in very little milk and her weight dropped nearly a whole pound from her birth weight in the first week . the pediatrician told us we would have to supplement with formula to bring her weight up . i chose the premium nurser bottles because they said they were good for switching between breast and bottle feeding . my daughter took well to the bottles , and even started latching on better when i did breast feed . i 'm continuing to use formula along with breastfeeding with no nipple confusion problems whatsoever . when people ask me if i breastfeed or bottlefeed my baby , i say `` both '' , and they tell me how lucky i am ! these bottles are a life-saver ! they 're easy to clean ( i use the top rack of the dishwasher ) , and my baby has n't had any problems with colic . i like the convenience of the disposable bags , too . and my daughter is now starting to `` help '' hold on to the bottle while i feed her . these are the best
0	i used these pads when i first started nursing . they did a good job of keeping me from leaking onto my clothes . however , my nipples were incredibly sore . when i took my baby to her first appt. , the pediatrician suggested cloth pads . what a difference ! yes , they did cause me to leak through a little , but that was needed . when all the moisture from let down is pooled up against your breast it causes sore nipples for some moms . do n't use these . buy some cloth ones instead that will allow your nipples to breath ( i use the imse vimse )
0	i was so excited to buy this stroller . it seemed perfect for my 1 yr old daughter . the mesh back would be ideal for the hot , humid weather . it 's light and easy to travel with . it seemed sturdy . most of this was true until i used it for a month . honestly , the seat is way too big ! my daughter was forever uncomfortable b/c the straps were too loose even at their tightest to hold her and the seat was too deep . with minimal padding ( and no recline ) she would bump her head on the side frame when riding around . and to top it off , the frame bent after basic use . all we did was take it in and out of the car ! i was very disappointed . maybe this would be a great stroller for a 4 year old , but do n't buy this stroller b/c you 're looking for something smaller than your graco ( but better than an umbrella stroller ) for your young toddler . i think for the price and minimal features it should be of better quality . every review mentioned the carrying strap b/c that 's the only extra feature ! this stroller was not for us !
1	having only used it once , as my baby is just now able to eat table foods when we go out to eat , it worked wonderful . having a clean place to put her food on was nice , as you never know just how clean the tables really are
1	well , i 'm sure this is probably a novel use for this product , but we bought this for our great dane to sleep on . he 's giant and old and needed more support that the traditional dog bed , but orthopedic giant dog beds started at over $ 200 . we got the idea to try a baby crib mattress , and ordered it . very soon thereafter i arrived home from work and was puzzled to find no dog blocking my way into the door waiting for a head pat ; it seemed the mattress had arrived and he was simply immovable . he loves it . it is well crafted and everything the ad said . our use is quite unconventional but it works well and we could highly recommnend this for anybody with a large dog
0	we bought this product so that i could see my 6 month old son from the front seat . but everytime i put the rear view mirror on the back window it would pop off and hit my son in the face . the blinds do n't stay up either . their suctions do n't stay if there is any moisture on your windows and when you shut your car door .
1	i registered for this item as one of those `` i would n't buy it but it 's a nice thing to have '' . i did receive it and am so glad i did . my son loves this ! ! he gets so comfy and warm and will sleep for hours in this boppy lounger . i would defninitely recommend this and would buy more if i needed them
0	i used this bag once when traveling and then the zipper completely fell off because it was improperly made , then i got a new bag ( customer service was very nice and helpful ) and it has a huge rip in the bottom after only traveling with it once and gate checking it ( my stroller was n't damaged ) , so i have concluded that it is horribly made and a waste of money , still waiting on a refund
1	this pillow has become my preganant wife 's best freind . she snuggles with this pillow way more than she snuggles with me
0	i had purchased the dr. brown bottles after the birth of my boy/girl twins in hopes of helping my son with his gasiness . they did help ease his suffering but he was also put on soy which seemed to help the most . by this point , both babies had become attached to these bottles and would n't use anything else . at first i thought i must be doing something wrong for them to continually leak , and sometimes pour out of the rim of the bottle . ( i have a total of 4 kids and have been through lots of different types of bottles , none this bad ! ) we tried everthing to stop the leaks - *using only all dry parts for each new bottle *not heating or storing in the fridge with the valve and stem inside *not overfilling after an entire year of frustration with these leaking bottles i noticed that when my son would hold it by the nipple or squeeze the nipple , that milk would come pouring down the sides ! finally , the answer to the leaks ! ! ! is truly a great idea and i hope they try to perfect it , but these have a major design flaw - and babies drenched with formula in the middle of the night is no fun . these items were meant for baby use , and for the price it should help make babies ' mom 's life easier . stick with avent or playtex with liners . thank you good luck
0	i purchased this bed online last year . it looks great and as we all know our daughters love dora . however , the bed was a disaster to put together and if your not handy , you would problably give up . the rods that come with the bed do not stay in the holes , and for a very active 3 year old this bed will not last 3 months . & lt ; br / & gt ; what a waste of money , invest a bed that your child can growth with , and something that will withstand the active lifestyle of the average child
1	these are one of two brands that my daughter does not soak through in the night . they wash up nicely and seem as good as the day i bought them . my only wish is that they had fold back laundry tabs for the velcro . they stick to other things in the wash . i think this puts extra wear on the velcro too
0	i purchased this item after hearing comments that a unit that heats from top down works better . i was highly disappointed with this unit as it does not heat the entire wipe , wipes must always be filled to the top and the wipe cools down too quickly . unfortunately i do n't have the original box therefore can not return the item . i am now going to purchase a warmer that is sold from one step ahead that also heats wipes from top down but is not something that attaches to a wipe box . through friends i have heard this other unit works great and have been reassured that i wo n't be disappointed . hopefully babiesrus will sell this other item in the future
1	i bought this as a gift - ca n't give much opinion - she told me she loved them , so i give it 5 stars . maybe that 's not a fair review , but it 's breast pads . they are always useful ! lo
1	i was a bit nervous about buying these covers after reading the negative reviews , but i did it anyway , and i 'm glad . the covers are durable -- the color has n't faded , and it still fits perfectly over the changing pad . i think they 're soft enough for diaper changing -- i would n't put my baby to sleep on it , but then , who would
1	the pacified pod isn 's `` essential '' , but it 's definitely good to have . you can keep the pacifier clean and easier to find in the diaper bag or in mom 's bag , or you can simply hook this on the stroller if you are just going for a walk . and with all the cute patterns , you can definitely find one that suits your taste and matches your stroller or diaper bag
0	we have this stroller and are n't really thrilled with it . in fact , we 're going to buy a different double stroller to replace it . our children are aged 2 years and 4 months . while the 3 month old was still in his car seat/carrier , this stroller worked well for him . he 's now out grown the carrier , and we 've put him in the seat of the stroller . the shoulder straps are too tight for him and do n't adjust well . the seat is n't padded well and there is no head support . our 2 year old does not like the back of the stroller . with the infant in the front , we have to keep it reclined , so my daughter has to lean forward if she 's sitting in the back . she hates standing on it because she is very short and she ca n't see anything . she would much prefer to sit in the front . we find that the basket in the bottom is practically useless . we ca n't reach it so we never use it . there is no cup holder or tray for the parents . it is also a bit bulky when folded and heavy . so , i think that we will put this stroller in storage until the kids are older and get a double stroller with 2 seats for now
0	this is such a ridiculous excuse for a toilet seat lid . it 's easy enough to install but hello ! what 's to stop anybody , especially a toddler from lifting the entire seat and lid together ? not a thing ! the `` kit '' that comes with it to secure it to the toilet rim is a joke in that it rattles around like crazy and when it 's closed , it does n't fit snuggly around the seat so it 's completely loose . total and complete piece of junk ! !
1	this diaper bag is a great urban carrier for baby items and can easily pass off as a regular messenger bag for every day use . * it 's functional and has multiple organizers , including a place for your cell phone , keys , and a zippered insulated compartment for baby 's bottle or a toddler 's drink . * for parents , there are two inside pockets with zippers that are perfect for wallets and other small items . the interior has easy stash pockets for storing diapers , wipes , and other baby essentials . * overall , it 's a stylish looking bag that moms or dads could use . the design is trendy without having an appearance that will become easily outdated . * after nearly two years of daily use , it 's still in good condition and shows little signs of wear . * it 's also a very convenient on-the-go type bag that stays put when you 're out and about
0	this diaper pail is affordable and uses regular garbage bags , both of which were important to us when buying a diaper pail before the reality of dirty diapers . even when we emptied the pail often and sprayed it with lysol between uses , it still smelled bad every time we opened it . sometimes the smell seeped out , so it made the whole bedroom stink . and my kids have no problem pressing the blue lid-popping latch-and , of course , adding their toys or other opjects to the contents of the dirty diaper pail . the twisting mechanism to remove the full bag is a great idea . it helps you not get the face full of odor when you open the pail ... but you can not let the pail get even close to full , or it wont twist . and after two years of use , the twisting mechanism does n't work anymore . the latch for the small opening is also broken
0	i had tried this for my newborn and i think this product is unsafe and not sturdy . the base of the seat is very wobbley , it would help to have suction cups on the bottom . and you do have to fill your tub about half way in order for your child to stay warm . also , when i put my baby in the seat and he is 12 lbs , the seat tipped backwards . i can imagine that it would be worse when my child is heaviear and moves around more . i do not think this product is safe . it would make a great product if they included a baby tub with it . so i returned the product and ended up with the 4-in-1 bath station from safety first that worked well with my first child
1	this is so much better than the bjorn carrier . you can wear it on the hip or in front . it is very comfortable . my baby always felt secure and i never thought he would come out . i could wear my 25 pound baby for 2 hours without a problem . my back and shoulders were never sore . easy to put on . great way to calm a fussy baby ! reversible black for men too
0	it 's a chunk of plastic with some bits of rubber attached . effectively serves its purpose , but for nearly 16 bucks ? ! ! puleeeeeeeease
1	i love this swing - my fussy first child could not live without it . i had my second child two years later and the swing is now really loud . i called fisher price and they said that the motor will wear out with use . so now mine sounds like a metronome - it clicks back and forth . if i had to do it all over again - i would still buy this swing b/c of the design . i just wish that fp would build a motor that was more durable and better yet - that plugs into the wall
1	this product was very easy to use , quick clean up , and very discrete to carry in public . my husband and i are constantly using it when we are out with our child . i especially like the compartment for diaper storage and wipe storage
0	i bought this item despite the review that said it was too small . big mistake . it is small ! it 's not big enough for my 21 months old . i 'm very dissapointed because i liked the infant version .
0	i got two of these as shower gifts . i thought that they would be so handy . wrong ! the velcro kept slipping and sounded as if it would fall off of the changing table . the openings that are shown holding the powder and lotion are very small . they will only hold the travel size or the next size up . it was made cheep . the `` shelves '' are not sturdy at all . save your money !
1	our hungry pelican is now on child number three and shows no signs of wear despite being a favorite crib toy for many years . the bright yellow velour pelican ties onto the crib railing . his fat cheeks squeak , his wings crinkle , and his feet rattle . he comes with four sea creatures ( crab , shrimp , fish , and octopus ) that are each different textures and colors , and make different sounds ( rattle , rustle , etc. ) . children can put the little animals into pelican 's mouth and watch them drop down into his tummy . the large circular tummy opening allows for easy removal of the animals so play can begin all over again . i found that babies enjoy quietly investigating the sounds , colors , and textures of the four little sea creatures . toddlers progress to the eating game . i am grateful to mr. pelican for allowing me an extra half hour of sleep every morning . what can be better than that !
0	we purchased storkcraft 's rochester stages crib in natural , aspen changing table , 5 drawer dresser , 3 drawer dresser , 2 side units ( left and right ) and a hutch . every single piece of furniture that we 've gotten from storkcraft is damaged in some way ~ nicks and scratches and paint on a lot of the pieces . on the side panel of the 5 drawer dresser the piece is completely cracked . it 's obvious that storkcraft has no quality control . we 're in the process of deciding whether or not we 're going to return all of the furniture or just get replacement parts and/or a new unit . all i 'm going to say is do n't waste your time on purchasing storkcraft furniture
0	reasons why i do not like this potty : 1 ) the shield falls off with one touch , ussually into the potty ! 2 ) the potty has many cracks and crevices in the bottom that collect pee in numerous ways . 3 ) it is cumbersome to empty the potty . 4 ) once the shield is lost ( since it impossible to keep attached ) it is hard for boys to sit down and not make a mess . i highly recommend that bjorn potty since it is all one piece and with a built in shield
0	i purchased the peg perego aria stroller last month for my 3rd son . needless to say , i have lots of experience in the stroller world . this was my first peg perego stroller purchase as i have used graco and maclaren in the past . i had been using my maclaren umbrella stroller ( which i purchased in 2000 when my first son was 6 months old ) and thought i would buy a new stroller since the other was a bit old . my girlfriend recommended the aria so i purchased it . anyways , it was a huge disappointment . the steering is awful . you definately need two hands for this stroller . the stroller is also extrememly `` wobbly '' . i was shocked as i figured such an `` upscale '' brand would be quality enough not to wobble so much . the 5 point restraint is hard to stay in place as the back straps are attached into a little `` envelope '' type holder but it always comes out as there is no device to actually secure it in place . it is bulky in that it does n't fold into a small compact stroller . i used this 3 times and just gave it away ... what a waste of $ $ . i 'm back to using my maclaren , which looks thrashed but is a wonderful stroller . i could kick myself for wasting the money . my advice to you is test it out before you buy it ! ! ! ( do n't rely on the name
0	though this potty is nicely priced , it 's worth it to buy a more expensive one . though mine has n't fallen apart like other reviewers , it does shift around on the base , allowing for spillage . the removeable receptacle in the base is way too far from the actual seat , so my daughter gets stuff all over the inside , not just in the receptacle . the inside has a criss-crossed honeycomb type pattern ( see my customer image ) so it 's impossible to clean messes out of it . it does serve it 's purpose as a potty , but i 'm definatly going to buy a different one when my son is old enough for one
0	i bought these for my daughter thinking that maybe they would n't leak like the last ones i had used . they do n't leak , but the stage 1 is too slow and frustrates her . she 's 5 months and the stage 2 is too fast . they made a huge mistake in not making more stages . had i realized this before i had used them , i would have taken them all back
1	my mother-in-law bought these for my daughter . at first , i was skeptical about how entertaining they would be , but my daughter took to them right away . in the beginning , she would just chew on them and smile at the quacking duck noise , but now she interacts more and seems to love feeling all the different textures . she also loves to knock them down when i stack them up . they wo n't entertain her for hours , but she 's always thrilled to see them when i break them out for the first time that day
1	unfortunately - the baby i bought this for already had one ! but i got to see it in action , and listen to the parents rave about it ! it is really neat - almsot to the point i wish i had kept it for myself ! !
0	i agree with all the other reviews saying the warmer with burn your hands and overheat the bottle . especially when you only have a few oz in the bottle . the water in the warmer actually boil when it heats up and if the bottle got stuck in the handle , it means you have to use your bare hands to separate the boiled bottle and the boiled handle . you end up having a boiled hand as well . the worst part is it will burn your love one ... . not only that , the cooler does not close well so the content will not really be kept fresh even the ice-pack is frozen before placing into the cooler . we switched to avent warmer . a little more $ $ but it is much better . i would not recommend this product
1	other parents told us about these , specifically the vanilla scented ones . baby # 1 was bottle fed and took to an advent pacifier right away . we used the scented soothies whenever we could n't get a bottle ready fast enough for her likes . not sure if it was the shape of the soothie pacifier or the scent , but she always calmed down wihle we 'd finish getting the bottle ready . baby # 2 was also bottle fed , but did not take to any pacifier right away . we tried these regular soothies as well as the vanilla ones and the advent ones too . she eventually took to the advent . it really is up to each baby what they will like . but these are definately worth trying . in addition to the regular and vanilla ones , there are also various sizes , including preemie , pacifiers attached to small stuffed , plush animals that are easier for babies to find and put into their mouth ... and also easier for mom dad to in the back of the car , the darkened bedroom , etc
1	this jogger is great - i love the quick fold feature and my daughter seems very comfy in it - no complaints , in fact she seems to look forward to going on runs w/ mo
1	this crib has been a smash hit with our baby girl . not too big yet roomy enough to spread out . she loves sleeping in her crib , and we like the size and convenience . not sorry for the purchase ! carl
0	after three weeks my brush broke too ! can not find a replacement , i do not want to buy a whole new rack . design fault that they should correct . not good enoug
0	we love this monitor , but only when it does not have awful interference . unfortunately , in the evening for some reason the interference is really bad and all we hear is static off and on for hours . we do not live in an apartment or townhouse ( which i read was not recommended for this product ) , but we do have wireless internet . only we are n't using it when there is static , so who knows ... i love being able to see my boy , but the static makes the monitor really annoying
1	my daughter ordered this to go with the crib shield system . it 's a nice addition to the system and looks very nice
1	my baby is now 5 months old , and we 've been using the halo sleep sac since she started moving around more . i was always worried with the regular blanket because more than a few times she would wake up crying because she had kicked her regular blanket onto her face ! now , i never worry that she will soffocate or that she will be cold in the middle of the night . this product really gives me peace of mind and i 'll be sure to give this to any new parent friends
1	i cringe at the idea that i fed my baby from heated up polycarbonate bottles . i might not be able to breastfeed my baby , but with my new glass bottles , at least i know that i am feeding her the purest form of formula i can possibly give . she hated the taste of the latex rubber nipples so i bought some silicone ones and was successful . when i consider the epidemic of autism in this country , i am dedicated to buying pure , organic baby products and avoiding using plastic products especially when heating in the microwave .
0	i bought this stroller last year when it went on sale at a local story . luckily it was a floor model so it was even further discounted . i bought it because it was lightweight , had a front tray , adult drink holder and was in a very stylish orange color . i was looking for a stroller with all the features of my full size gracco but light weight and smaller to put in my trunk . well , after a couple weeks , i changed back to my umbrella stroller and use my graco for longer trips . here are the negatives i experienced with the peg prego aria : - poor steering . can not handle quick turns . - sun shade only works for direct overhead sun . - 5 point harness is poorly designed . the plastic hook is always coming undone and gets tangled . - my drink holder broke . - overpriced for features and quality . my positives are : - nice looking - easy to fold - lightweight i keep this stroller in our attic now as an extra stroller for when we have company . thankfully it folds up small and does not take up too much room ! i would not buy a peg prego again
0	if you research the toxic gas theory for crib death ( which has been around for 15 ? years ) you will see that this item can produce toxic nerve gases just like crib mattresses can . this product is not safe at all , no matter what they call it . get a babesafe mattress cover to prevent toxic nerve gases from getting to your baby , and use only 100 % cotton on top of that ( between your baby and the mattress cover ) . do not use polyester fleece or acrylic blankets or comforters and use 100 % cotton blankets . run from this product
0	i 'm a big believer in reading amazon reviews -- customers rarely lead me astray ! but this chair ( which we bought specifically because of everyone 's praise ) is miserable ! i do n't understand why it got such high marks ... the tray is way too huge for easy cleaning and it ( rather than the chair ) has a `` leg separator , '' which means you ca n't set it down anywhere without it tipping all over the place . we 've also found that the tray can be extremely difficult to hook onto the chair , and does n't push in towards the baby 's belly far enough . in addition , the clips that attach the harness are filled with grooves and ca n't be cleaned well , so they 're beyond gross , just after a few feedings . of all the baby things we wish we 'd never bought , this is number one on the list ... i ca n't help feeling that if we 'd just closed our eyes and pointed at random to a high chair , we would have done better than this thing ... the only reason it gets one star is because i appreciate the non-obnoxious print -- it 's nice to not have something on display with clowns or fish or teddy bears or bright colors . ;
1	overall , we are very happy with this product . i like that it covers the entire side of the crib and does n't come up only partway like a traditional bumper . also , i like the breathable netting since baby can see out through it and since it `` gives '' a bit when baby pushes and kicks it . we have a nonstandard length crib ( babee tenda ) , so we do have small gaps at each end of the rail , but we had read about this issue in another review from a babee tenda crib owner , so we knew up front we would have these gaps . these small gaps have not been a problem for us as our baby does n't seem to want to stick her legs through the gaps in this location ( i think it 's difficult since she would have to lie almost flush with the headboard or footboard to do so ) . the white satin edge is very pleasant to look at . overall i like this product much more than the traditional bumpers i have seen .
0	i will not buy these again . they are tiny , thick and do not tapper on the edges . this means you will see the lines thru your shirts . the adhesive is n't enough and the pads shifted durring the night . i highly recommend the lansinoh or medela , they cover more , are thinner and stick better .
1	i bought this w/ the hippo travel high chair . it worked great and kept things cleaner . unfortunately it was in the case w/ the chair when it was stolen out of our truck .
1	i purchased your `` space saver highchair '' for my 9 month old daughter who is severely disabled . finding equipment for the very young disabled child is very difficult . this chair works for everything ! this chair is so comforatable for my daughter and allows her to sit up and play with her toys as she gets very bored laying on her back all day . she also has a very difficult time playing with her toys as her grasp is not well controlled and she is constantly dropping toys on her face or off to the side and can not get them back in her hand . i love this chair for its size , the way the whole seat tilts ( not just the back ) , and the 5 point harness . the chair is also small so it holds her very nicely . my daughter loves nothing more than to sit in this chair all the time
1	this bib does it all and there are no complaints whatsoever ! i used to go through 8-10 bibs every few days , but now this is the only bib i use every day , all day ! easy to wash , catches everything so there is little mess on or around my child and it 's easy on , easy off !
0	i have looked at alot of other reviews before i bought and wished that i had n't because . you ca n't go off someone else 's experience , you really have to experience it for yourself . first of all it 's too bulky . the suction thing on the tub did n't stick and it was in the way when i tried to shower and kept falling down . my poor baby kept sliding because there is no non-skid at the bottom of the tub , so i had to go out and buy a small mat to put at the bottom . i bought this tub only because my baby was out growing the fold away bath chair but it looks as though i will have to continue using it and buy a larger one for her . i was very temped to send it back but i 'm just going to sell it on ebay . i 'm sorry but it was a waste of money for me . i 'm happy that it did aleast work out for the other moms , maybe mines is defected !
1	now that i 've caved to the power of pink ( it only took three girls for me to finally give in ) , this turns out to be very cute and was the second cheapest i could find . quality seems fine ( two weeks post purchase ) and who does n't love a tool that keeps the kiddo safe and calm while one does dishes or makes dinner for the rest of the brood ... ? for the first babe , we were given a different seat that aimed to be an improvement over the classic and very simple bouncy seat , but had so many functions it was basically useless . this is a case , though , where the basics are the best . in looking around for a new one , saw many for $ 100 ; if you can stomach the not-as-posh aesthetic , this seems like a great value for a seat that will only used for a few months , anyway
1	i have a home daycare , so this chair is used constantly . i 've had two of these for well over a year , and today i bought a third one . i 've tried several different seats in the past and this one is the best by far . nothing beats the swinging tray . i would recommend it to anyone
1	i have used several monitors in the past 7 years and chose this one due to the walkie-talkie feature . it works well and has a great range . the vibration is a nice feature so that you can turn down the sound when you have company and are having a conversation ; no one else has to hear your little ones settling down for their sleep
1	as i am not personally using this , i can only pass on what i have been told . it does a great job of trapping odors and making terrific sausages which are easily thrown away
0	i gave my father-in-law a couple ideas for my son 's ( 1 year old ) christmas gift and this was one of the items . boy do i regret giving him this as an idea . it is a cheaply constructed toy . the bus 's hood does n't even work correctly . the toy does not do much of interest and it constantly makes this annoying noise ! the toy held my son 's attention for less than 5 minutes . my suggestion to anyone considering this toy is there are many more worthwhile toys on the market- skip this one
0	this stroller is way to heavy , too long , steering is very difficult and too bulky , it is huge when folded . try something else .
0	our daughter loves the mobile , she laughs every time the peek-a-boo leaves open to reveal the animals . unfortunately both mobiles that we have bought have failed , none of the music buttons will work except the forest sounds . the sound is also very soft
1	i love this simply designed , sturdy potty . my son loves it which is most important . he has no trouble sitting down on it ; no pinching , no crampedness , no tipping over . the well sized arm rests help him up down the splash gaurd is high enough to prevent him peeing all over ! having only 2 pieces no crevices or anywhere for stuff to get trapped it is so incredibly easy to clean . the first few days we had it my son thought it was so comfy that he would bring into the living room to sit on read books ! great product , great price . i am now planning on getting another one to leave at my mother 's .
0	i bought the bottles and when i used them all the milk came out and get all the baby we
0	these bottles leak after a few months and it 's hard to find new parts for the botttom of the bottle . you almost have to buy more bottles to get new parts when they leak .
0	the only good thing i can really say about this seat is that it comes in pink . it 's hard to find carseats that are not really ugly . otherwise i can not take my newborn out without help because this seat does not recline far enough back and her head flops forward . i will be returning to work in a couple of weeks and will be bringing her with me ( i 'm a nanny ) i do n't know how we are going to do it and may have to purchase a new seat already . i would think that if something is deemed an `` infant '' ' carseat it should work correctly and safely from birth not from when the baby can hold their head up
0	this potty is completely useless . it is so small that my three years olds ' knees are up by his shoulders when he sits on it . it is unstable on those little plastic legs and it 's opening is too small for their little bottoms and it hurts them to sit on it . this potty only stands about four inches off the ground so unless your toddler is the size of a six month old this thing is useless
0	first , i agree with other reviewers who say that this helps their baby 's sleep better . that i can not deny . our two+ week old little girl seems to love it and seems to sleep for longer stretches on it without waking . however , the trade off in better sleep is not worth the risk . i woke up last night to find that she had slipped down and her face was right between the bolsters . she could have easily suffocated ! this is a very common complaint with this product ( both here on amazon 's web site as well as on target 's web site where there are many parents who have reporting having the same scary moment that i had ) . some reviews seem say that if you have a real squirmy older baby that that is the true problem with this product . i have to tell you that that is not quite the case . our little two week old is tightly swaddled at night and does n't move a whole lot - yet she slipped down to a position where she could have suffocated . the bolsters were very tight to her sides and so that does n't explain things either . if you choose to purchase this product , please be very careful with it . i understand that those of you who have infant with reflux do n't really have a choice about this but i recommend that you try it first in the daytime with your infant closely supervised so you can see if they are likely to slip down . as for us , we may try to keep using it by elevating the bottom a little with a blanket underneath but we are absolutely getting rid of the bolsters .
0	my experience has been similar to that of other reviewers . the one movable positioner secures very loosely with a small piece of velcro . my two week old daughter managed to slide down in between the positioners and had her face against one of them when i checked her in the middle of the night . honestly , the only way a baby would stay on this thing is if they did n't move their arms ... so perhaps the designers had no children of their own
1	i bought this pump about 6 weeks after my son was born and i love it . he 's 5 months old now and i have used it while working since he was 3 months old without any problems . i have to pump in the ladies room where i work , but this pump is so quiet that no one knows what i 'm doing . i work 10 hour shifts , so i pump quite a bit , but this pump is so easy to use that i do n't have the hand/wrist pain that i 've had with other manual pumps . overall , the bag is stylish and discreet , the bottles are fabulous ( no nipple confusion problems ) and i have not had any problems with any part of it . the only thing i would suggest to someone looking to purchase one of these is to acquire additional ice packs if you ca n't keep your milk in the fridge . i had to buy two more solid ice packs to keep my milk cold all day . otherwise , i have no complaints . excellent product and service
0	this item is too small . i kept putting it on the back windshield but it kept falling down each time . i could not see my baby in this tiny mirror . not worth the money at all
0	this product is not a safe product and should not be used with your child . not only does it give additional padding that was not intended , nor tested with your safety seat , but it also voids the warranty of the safety seat . nhtsa ( national highway traffic safety administration ) is the government agency that sets standards for child safety seats and states that `` after-market products '' should not be used . it also does not meet fmvss213 standards as stated in the manufacturer 's description
0	this would be a great space-saver . . . but now that gerber has started using the plastic tubs instead of the jars , we never used it at all ! ! now gerber makes their own feeding center to accommodate their tubs , and i love it
0	we are `` training '' and really were looking for a useful aid . it did n't work for us , allowing the entire car seat and straps to become saturated . we will continue to use it with our younger child , in hopes of avoiding a diaper `` leak through '' accident .
0	i was really disappointed in this `` sealy ultra '' . it does not feel like a very good mattress . we 'll use this for a couple months and replace it with something better . i 'd say you need to see the mattress , decide the one you want and then look for the best price on the internet
1	it is hard when you have an infant to secure them in their car seat with a huge snowsuit on . i found myself dredding going out because my daughter would look like an eskimo in her car seat . i was delighted when i found the urban me bundle . i do n't have to worry about bundling her up in heavy gear when we go out . we just put on her hat and go . the urban me bundle gives your child enough breathing room as well as providing warmth and comfort . it helps too that it is rain resistant . i have received many compliments on my urban me bundle and found it to be a wise investment . it really does n't compare to the other ones that are on the market because you can definitely see the difference in quality of the fabric inside and out
1	we have a small home and decided to opt for this type of high chair instead of a stand alone . we just love it and so does our 6 month old
0	i was very disappointed with this pump . it was very loud and stopped working after 3 weeks , and i only used it once a day . even more disappointing was the companys return policy . you have to ship it to them at your expense , wait for them to send you a new one , and return that one to the store . do not waste your time
0	this is the worst pump you could buy . i have gone through 3 of them because the motor breaks down . it also has put me behind in what my daughter is drinking while i am at work . please do n't waste your money ... ... . i also spoke with hospitals and they mentioned that they have many many complaints about this product . if you do n't believe the bad reviews call the hospital and they will tell you the same thing . i recently got a new pump from a friend and found that the evenflow is by far the loudest pump on the planet -- there is no descreet pumping for you if you own this product
1	i 'm not sure what the other reviewer was talking about -- the product installs on the bowl and secures the lid and toilet seat . it 's easy to install and works great
0	i bought this item in preparation for my first child . i tried it 8 times on me and my husband and got a different reading each time , from 94.2 - 102.3 ! ! i returned it the next day , do n't bother !
0	this seat does not fit in any snap and go stroller and is not exceptionally light . if i were to do this over , i would buy a different infant seat
0	the screws that come with the brackets are so soft they strip almost immediately -- - was about to use my own , then read the review below and decided i 'd be better off just screwing the furniture into the wall . .
1	my son loved this ! i purchased this item because i was not comfortable with the idea of hanging something from a door frame . i was nervous that the one that hangs from a door might somehow come down . i felt that my baby was very safe in this and i could put it anywhere in the house that i was . once he was walking , he did n't use it again
1	when it comes to using this for your children you 'd have to first know what your needs are . i ca n't imagine it stopping any determined child without some reinforcing ; it would be more like a psychological barrier . but depending on their temperament and age it may be good to deter them from getting to things they should n't have . i ordered this to use for my puppy . in my case i do n't have the problem of her pushing on it so i ca n't say how long it would last through that . for this price i was quite happy with the quality and it was amazingly simply to install .
1	first , i must say that this sling was an absolute lifesaver when my ( somewhat colicky ) son was a newborn . no matter how fretful his mewling , when we swaddled him and placed him in this sling , he would fall asleep . because he otherwise rarely slept in those early weeks , he spent a good deal of time in it . three aspects of the design are great : 1 . the bottom is padded so you can lay baby on a hard surface and use sling as a changing pad ; 2 . the sides are high and have drawstrings that allow the sling to be opened up almost flat ; 3 . it grows with your baby -- my tiny baby hated the front-type bjorn carriers , but loved this and still likes it . one aspect of the design is , to me , dreadful -- the shoulder strap ! it should be wider and padded . i tried repositioning it every which way and no matter what i did , the strap dug into my shoulder . in the end i just put a thick mitten under the strap on my shoulder . good use for a mitten that 's lost it 's mate , but i would rather have a better strap
1	what a great product . it really keeps the baby warm even in the coldest winter . when the wind is whipping , the generous front flap flips up over the carrying arm of the baby seat and also keeps the baby warm . no fussy coats and hundreds of blankets . i hope to use it next winter also
1	we loved the mini co sleeper ! our son used it until he was around 4 months and his trasition into his crib was so easy . i loved having him right next to me without the worry of rolling on him or waking him up in our bed . i could check on him just by looking at him or putting my hand on him and i didnt even have to roll out of bed . the mini co sleeper was so portable that i never even bought a pack n play . we traveled a lot the first few months with our son and it was so easy to take his bed with us . i highly reccomend the mini co sleeper and the leg extensions were great since our bed was a little high . i will use this for our next baby as well
1	[ ... ] it def . is ... very sturdy , does n't move around once you strap it on to the chair and it looks good too : ) i 'm very happy with this chair - the contoured seat back really hugs the baby yet doesnt constrict his arms ... i love the size of the tray and the size of the cupholders . i find it very easy to hand wash as the bottom only needs a good rinse ... my son has n't gotten food under there yet ... i ca n't wait to use it as a booster seat :
0	i installed this mirror in our car two days ago . today it was in my daughter 's lap when i went to get her out of the car . the mirror broke off from the base . i bought it because it seemed safer than the other types of mirrors ( suction cup attachment , etc ) . i would not recommend this product
1	i just bought these and my daughter looks adorable . the first time i put them on she got a little fussy until she realized she could see through them . the shades come with two straps , one small and one large . my daughter is four months old and the smaller strap barely fits but the larger one is still a little big . the velcro on either side of the smaller strap is just barely attached and fits comfortably only if around the bottom of her head . in this position , her ears are a little pushed down but as the strap is soft it 's not a big deal . if straight around her head , the shades are too tight and squish the area around her eyes . even if adjusted as small as possible , the large strap is still a little too big . it should fit in another month i think .
1	i have this exact same soft light green deluxe pillow . i bought the pillow when she was about 2 weeks old . and i have been wearing it almost all day long every day since . she is 11 weeks old today . she is so comfortable when nursing on this pillow . the cushion is made of firm foam . she falls asleep on the pillow while it is around my waist . even when she 's not nursing or napping , the pillow helps me to support her weight when i 'm sitting or standing . it fits me very comfortably even though i 'm plus size . the only drawback is that i need to order an additional slipcover because it can only be hung to dry , although it is machine washable . i really love this fabric , but apparently , this fabric is not available to purchase separately as a slipcover , so i guess i 'll try the oatmeal twill cover .
1	i bought this chair second-hand for my six month old son , and he loves it ( whereas he hated the hard wooden restaurant high chairs ) . it 's a great size , easy to use , good color for hiding stains , and comfortable for him to sit in . best of all , because it folds up so easily and comes with a carry bag , we can be sure that he does n't get exposed to the germs of every other little kid who frequents the restaurants where we eat ! this is an excellent product , and well worth the money
0	this accessory system does not fit my kohlcraft umbrella stroller . i can find a place to put the parent cupholder , but there is no place at all to put the child 's snack tray . the stroller will not close when it is attached anywhere on the stroller . the whole purpose of spending the money on this `` system '' ( which was considerably more expensive than others in the store ) was for my child to have a snack tray . therefore , it 's going back to the store . there are plenty of other cup accessories out there that are far cheaper than this ... even the prince lionheart cupholder alone was very expensive ... the product itself is also very cheaply made . the `` s '' hooks look so flimsy i would n't trust them ... again , they sell thicker , sturdier `` s '' hooks that look like they will work much better than this , so that 's what i 'll purchase . plus , the parent cupholder is also extremely flimsy ... already the `` arms '' have fallen off several times and that was just moving it from the table to the kitchen counter ! thirdly , i 'm not sure if it was the `` clips '' that came in my packet ( perhaps a defect ) or if they are all made this way ... but it is extremely difficult to get the screws into the clips ... and then they did n't fasten correctly . no matter how i tried ( i worked on it for close to an hour and i consider myself pretty good at these things ! ) , i could not get the clips to tighten properly . they continued to be loose ... even with using the smaller screws . perhaps my stroller tubing is `` too small '' ? ? ? very unlikely , but it just might be the case . this is going back to the store , where i will purchase the insulated parent cupholder for $ 5 , a package of two ( thick ) `` s '' hooks for $ 3 and my child will have to learn to `` deal '' with holding her snack cup and straw cup . i will save myself $ 10 , a headache and backache from attempting to continue to get this on correctly , and my child will get the added bonus of learning to be responsible for her own items ! ! ! do yourself a favor and do n't bother with this product ! ! !
1	i 'm really pleased with this crib . the price was right and it arrived within a matter of days . shipping and handling costs were very low . a few dings here and there and the directions were a little hard to follow . otherwise , it looks great and is very sturdy . great crib for the price
1	i got this for my baby due in march . even though i live in new england area i knew the original bundle me would be too heavy . its perfect wieght for the 50-75 degree weather . it stays on the infant carseat at all times and that way my husband will never forget to have a blanket for the baby . it washes well too ! if you do get a day here and there when its a lot warmer and you do n't need it then the top part zips off and you do n't have to take baby out and remove the entire product . then the next chilly day zip the top back on ! great all around
1	that 's just it- i love this product , and i am so happy that we purchased it . it saves time and space , and is very safe for my children . we bought 2 , one for each of my children- and they have been wonderful
1	i love this product . i have 5 month old twins that were born 6 weeks early . i swaddled them in receiving blankets when they came home from the nicu and they loved sleeping that way . i stopped swaddling them at 2 months because i could see they no longer liked it . my night nurse told me to continue to swaddle them at night for up to a year . she said it would help them sleep through the night . i bought this product and while my girl and boy twins did n't like it at first they do go to sleep faster and stay asleep longer when they are wearing them . not long after i started using this product my son slept from 7 to 7 . what a dream ! he is getting better at getting at least one arm out but even when he does he still sleeps better then when he is not swaddled at all . i have found that it works better when i put them in it when they are drowsy because then they do n't lay in their crib trying to get out of it before they fall asleep . we do n't use them during the day now . i will always give this as a baby gift going forward
1	this monitor has the best sound quality you can put the radio on the monitor and listen on the recever , it will sound like the radio is next to you . i had the monitor for 2 year with out problems with range or interferance . my monitor is been on and in the same channel all that time . i try three other monitors one of them digital . the sony sound quality is untouchable . very sensitive , i can hear my baby move at night . i had no problems with range ( i work out on the basement during her nap ) . it has the best volume ( i can hear her over a loud treadmill and music ) . i was happy to return the other monitors to get this one . the one problen i found is the monitor and the recever can not be close to each other because it will make a horrible loud noise . to avoid this i turn off the monitor before getting close to the room the baby is sleeping in . the water resistant feature is great , i can put the recever right in the shower and listen or watch the lights . it is not waterproof ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! you do n't want to get it wet ! ! ! ! ! ! , but the humidity or a little splashing wo n't hurt it
1	this is the best bed rail if you do not have a box spring . my 2 year old recently moved into his toddler bed and i purchased this rail because he has a `` bunkie '' board instead of a box spring . the length is satisfactory , and the fold-down mechanism is perfect because of the raised hinges . it is easy to make the bed as well . we also purchased it for the grandparent 's house because they have a platform bed . it works equally as well . my only complaint is that maybe the rail is n't high enough but my son has n't been tempted to climb over it . i would recommend this bed rail for a good transition to a `` big boy '' bed that does n't have a box spring ( although the manufacturer recommends it )
1	i purchased this despite the reviews i read , out of desperation ! but have been very happy with the fit on my eddie bauer morgan gingham playard bassinet . it is a little thin , however , i use a carter 's mattress pad underneath anyway , so i am not concerned with absorbancy . it does the job as a nice surface to lay my son 's head on , and i purchased one more in navy to switch out when it is laundry time
1	the strap on mine broke and i was very quickly sent a replacement . i expressed my concerns about the size of the belt ( i have a small frame and it is big on me ) and i was told a newer design was in the works and they would send it to me once it 's done . very friendly , amazing customer service , that 's hard to find these days !
1	i am quite satisfied with this product overall . sometimes it is too sensative and gets electrical interferrence . during armer weaather when the window was opened i also picked up air traffic but over all it is a very good product
0	i bought this product as i was going on a long trip . i put the batteries in the mirror and it did not work . i put the batteries in the remote and it still did not work . all that would happen is that the little red light would flash and you could n't even turn it off without taking out the batteries . waste of money !
1	excellent product ... very difficult to find in stores . can safely heat breastmilk and formula in a warmer ... healthier than heating in plastic
0	i took this on a short trip , it proved useless . it 's unstable , has a sharp edge which cuts into the baby 's bottom -- i ca n't understand how anyone would be expected to sit on this ... especially a potty-training child ? my daughter was fairly young when we tried it ( we did some early pt , and she was about 10 months old ) . she 's now 2 , fully pt , but will still not go near it . if it was so flimpsy for a 10 months old , how would it do under the weight of an older child ? beyond me . i still give it 2 stars , because it 's an otherwise neat idea . impractical execution , though
0	we own two of these and they have never been easy to use . we tore holes in the first one trying to insert the seat . we have kept it though . we bought another and on our second trip the zippers broke off . we would not buy this one again . we do have large carseats - they are both britax marathons
0	i have small hands , so i actually ca n't grip this product with one hand . it slips right out , because there is no hole . the items are okay , really do n't like the nail cutters though , and they do n't stay in there places . i 'm sure there are better kits out there
0	the aspirator has no suction power and only irritated my son . the nail clippers are not sharp enough to cut a newborns soft nails . i use my own revlon clipper especially since i am comfortable with the feel of it already . the thermometer is sooo ... slow , i get make an educated guess faster . the case is cute and i am sure the medicine droppers are ok ... have n't needed those yet . but all in all , i threw half of this kit in the garbage
0	( 2 stars because the style is cool ... ) this was a christmas gift from my husband this year as our son is a big boy ( 19 1/2 lbs @ 4 months ) and it was too much to carry him , his carrier and a heavy diaper bag everyday to daycare so this seemed like the perfect solution ... and it was ... until the bag started coming apart 7 days after i received it ! and i was careful , i had read some of the other reviews about the stitches coming apart and i had thought they had just over filled the bag ... nope ! the bottle holder has ripped all the way down the side ... you ca n't overfill that ... there 's just room for one bottle , is n't that what it is made for ? ? ? my husband really loved this bag because it was n't 'girly or babyish ' but put the $ $ on something that will hold a bottle !
0	tried this and the zippering was poorly constructed . ihave a product from nano bags that beats this one in construction and comfort . this was nice only received as a gift but nothing more . washed poorly , disappointed
1	this potty is simple and very easy to clean with only two pieces . it is also more stable than others we used . we like it
1	i purchased these for my pack n ' play , and they are soft and durable . a real must-have for pack-n-play owners
0	i bought this pump the day i was discharged from the hospital ( 12/11/05 ) . i have used it on a part time basis since i am staying home and nurse directly . however , the motor broke and could n't pump anymore . my baby is only 5 months and this pump already broke . i have only used it during nights to keep a storage for my baby . i was lucky to call medela on time since this pump is still under its 6 month warranty period so i could get my money back .
0	i purchased this seat because of the safety factor that consumer reports reported on . in comparing the seat to graco snugride , however , i am very disappointed on the tough , very dense foam on the low back/sacral region of the seat . the foam goes down to a certain point on baby 's low back , and then disappears , leaving a dip for baby 's buttocks . just imagine sitting in a recliner with support only down to the low-back region ( with buttocks not supported ) ... not comfortable . i wonder how a baby 's backside would stand up to a traumatic jolt in that seat ... well , i 'm not going to take any chances . baby trend should have consulted a physical therapist ( like me ) before designing this seat .
1	i picked this monitor after reading many reviews . the reviews did n't lie . this monitor does great on distance . i have a 2400 sq ft home that has 3 floors . the bedrooms are on the 3rd floor and most of my housework ended up on the 2nd floor . i can have this on while vacuuming and still hear my son cry or even move around when he would wake up and not make a sound . i could hear him grunt even ! i do n't know why the one review mentions a 15ft signal loss . you 're given many channels in order to find the right strength . i could go outside of my home and walk approximately 10 ft away from the garage door and still have signal ( he was on opposite end of house upstairs ) . i also took the receiver in the shower a couple of times , not getting it soaked . also like the voice activated portion but that only works if the room or surrounding area has no sound ( no radio or tv or mobile playing ) . great product , strongly recommend . my son is now 5 months old and the monitor still works great . this monitor is the right choice for the average household . interference may come if you 're on the same channel . i have wifi network , cordless digital phones and nextels and do not have any interference with this monitor so others just do n't know how to resolve thier issue before blaming the product
0	i bought this sling when my son was 8 months old and 19 pounds . he hated this carrier because he could n't turn around and see the world . i hated this carrier because the rigid straps cut into my hips and shoulder every time he tried to move . the seller recommended making sure the straps were place correctly ( i tried numerous positions . there is n't a place on your body where unforgiving straps are particularly comfortable ) and also said to tighten the straps so the baby could n't move around . i did all of these things and still found it very uncomfortable to wear . the seller was helpful and the product arrived promptly , so i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 . there is a $ 5 return charge .
0	this lock works good for a little while , then the push mechanism breaks . it may or may not break completely off , so it could still work even when it breaks . i 've gone through two of these already , and they only lasted a few months before they broke
1	i am sure this is a good stroller ( that 's why i bought it ! ) my `` review '' is more of a word of caution : this thing takes forever to arrive . do n't be fooled : `` usually ships within 24 hours '' really means `` may ship sometime '' . as of 2/8/06 , our stroller has not arrived . it was ordered january 1 , 2006 . it is not even slated to ship for another week ( we 'll see ... ) . meanwhile , the local store has several in stock . my advice for anyone trying to time this as a gift or for a trip or other occasion : go to your local store . otherwise , be prepared to wait a very long time .
1	i did my research for the best stroller , thus this one is the best in market , travelling with my baby is much fun and easier . i can carry , fold and move it with no help , its so easy to open and fold . its very cozy , my baby can sleep happily in it
0	the nail clippers , hairbrush , and comb are great but i did not care for the rest . it would be cost effective to buy the items seperately from this company
1	my 4.5 month old son has never liked the plastic bathing tubs , so right from the very beginning , he 's been in the big tub with a tub seat . he loved bath time until just a few weeks ago , when he outgrew our original especially for baby ( the bru `` house '' brand ) tub seat . in desperation , we searched the shelves at bru and settled on the mother 's touch . i ca n't say enough good things about this tub seat . the head support features a soft washcloth-like insert to cushion a newborn 's delicate head , and it can be repositioned or removed as the baby grows . the two-position back reclines for newborns , and sits up straighter for older babies . the entire seat is up high enough that quite a bit of water is needed in the tub , but i found that it makes it easier to control how deep my baby sits in the water ( in the old tub seat , he had to be up to his ears in order to have enough water to bathe in ) . one of the things my son hated about his previous tub seat was that he could n't sit up in it . the design of the mother 's touch provides enough support to allow baby to sit up mostly unassisted , and the ample padding makes sure he does n't bruise himself on the hard edges . even though there 's lots of support and padding , it 's still very important to closely supervise your baby when using this ( or any ) tub seat . another reviewer mentioned a couple of things things that i 'd like to respond to : *there are no suction cups on the base : i have found that the rubber grips provide more than enough traction , but tubs may vary . *she would like a strap : the seat that i have does have a strap ( it 's stored underneath the seat , so may not be immediately identifiable ) , so i wonder if the seat has been redesigned recently . overall , my son and i are very happy with this tub seat , and i 've been recommending it to friends . they 'll have to buy it new instead of getting it as a hand-me-down , though . i foresee him being able to use it for most of his first year before he outgrows it !
1	we are in italy with these huge , weird shaped stairways . these gates are great and just what we were looking for . easy to install , easy to use once up . they look nice in our house
1	we bought this stroller today in honolulu at the bike factory . our son is 18 months old , 48 pounds and 40 inches tall ( yes , we know we got a linebacker on our hands ) so we had to find something that might last him for the next year or so . we love that the max weight is 70 pounds , but wonder if the harness system will grow with him being that we have already let out all the slack that is there , i think ? ? ! ! . i am going to read the instructions again to see if i might have missed something . but other than that , the stroller is very sturdy , well-made , and light weight . it handles like a dream and i would n't be afraid to take it to the mall shopping because it is not any wider or more cumbersome than our old graco . it folds up to a nice tiny package and fits perfectly in the back our explorer , where the graco did not . i ca n't wait to take it running down along the beach in the morning . oh , and our son loves it too by the way ... he watched elmo in the living room and would n't get out until we bribed him with a bath , so it must be pretty comfortable . definitely worth every dime , we love it . i ca n't say enough good things about bob either , they are very helpful and their website is pretty informative too , [ ...
0	i agree with rebecca -- bravados are more simple , more flexible , and more comfortable
0	i had been told that these were wonderful , to keep your baby safe while sleeping on his side or back . but my little man slides down to where his face is between the foam sides . this worries me more than if he were to sleep on his stomach
0	seemed like a good idea but these days it hardly fits over any of the grocery carts or high chairs at restaurants . so now it sits in my car fading in the sun . save your money
0	this idea is nice but , the tray is hard to fit up to your child its tight or too loose were food is in there lap . next the tray is hard to get off and wash. next mine came with a tray to cover or use as a tray , and that is really hard to get off , by the time i got it off i was ready toss it in the trash . unless you are super woman i would not bu
0	i registered for the entire locomotion collection before my son was born and have been very happy with it . i love the theme , but the mobile was a big disappointment . it did n't fit the crib properly and although my husband tried to figure out a way to install it without any type of conversion kit available , he just could n't attach it safely and we ended up returning it . also , although the mobile matches the theme , i found that the colors were n't very stimulating . we bought the tiny love symphony in motion mobile instead and although the colors did n't match , our son got many months of enjoyment and stimulation out of it .
1	the medela breast pump works with dr. brown 's bottles ( you can pump directly into the bottle ) ! just an added benefit to an already great product . i 've been using mine almost daily for 11 months and have had no problems . it 's worth the money if you plan on breastfeeding/pumping for more than a couple of months
0	we got this in lieu of another similar one because it was in stock , but lo and behold it only lasted a week . our son lays on his back and kicks everything in his crib , so when he kicked this , the knob securing it to the crib through the strap broke off . luckily the broken piece fell on the floor and not into his crib , where it could have posed a choking hazard ! pass on this and get a fisher price one - ocean wonders or the one we got , flutterbye dreams , which he loves
0	this product pulls nothing out of the noses of my one year old twins . we had hoped that it would be easier than manual aspirators but it has proven totally useless . unless your child 's nose is leaking like a faucet save your money and get the rubber aspirators .
0	we had to clean this high chair nearly every day and the process itself would take 30 minutes . i am not a neat freek in any way shape or form . but you kind of have to clean this frequently as the food goes into every nook and cranny . if i had to buy another chair i would get a wood one . we have the eddie bauer booster now that our son is older . we clean that once a day with a sponge which takes all of 1 minute and take the cushion off for a super clean once a week . the prima pappa is comfortable and secure . in the end i realized that we did n't need all the bells and whistles
0	loved the car seat , until my daughter was able to reach down and lift the velcro strap and release the harness portion of the straps . i would hope that the manufacturer would address this and move the harness tightening straps under the seat . that is my only complaint and it has indeed been a great car seat .
0	i ordered this through walmart.com and received it damaged , but walmart and/or storkcraft use a distributor called seko worldwide . the seko delivery truck delivered the crib . so either this is a storkcraft problem or a seko problem , but the head board had a piece completely split off in two and the other pieces were dented or chipped off . walmart is re-odering another crib and having this one picked up for me as it is an 80-pound box . hopefully the next crib wo n't be damaged , but if so , i am giving up on storkcraft completely . walmart did n't have a rating system to leave comments , and when i saw others on this website that had damage problems , i wanted to relay my experience as well . walmart graciously refunded my shipping fee , which was large . i then received the second crib and it was spotless . the delivery man from seko worldwide said that they hear complaints on this a lot and blamed the air carrier that flies the boxes out to the ground shipping location . i also emailed storkcraft about what happen and the other negative reviews , they offered to send a replacement piece for the broken piece ( but no mention about the dented/chipped piece ) and then proceeded to place the blame on the retailer . i was not impressed . i was willing to take my chances on the reorder and was one of the fortunate customers who recieved an unmarked crib . i put it together myself , all the parts were accounted for and the drawer works great . i only bought this for the price and the convertable feature but will not buy storkcraft in the future .
0	my daughter is only two months old and she slides off this thing all the time . i even tried to put a towell to make it less steep , but it did n't work . worst yet , her head would slide off the edge . i guess it will work for baby who is small and less than one month old and does not move around
1	good things : ( 1 ) no interference . we live in a residential neighborhood in the suburbs . ( 2 ) connects with no problem two stories down with the baby on 2nd floor and the monitor in the basement . i 've even used it out in the yard without any loss of connection problems . ( 3 ) you can hear pretty much everything happening in the nursery . only one bad thing -- the belt clips on the parent units are practically useless . they are not large enough to stay on a belt oe waistband with any normal amount of movement and the lip at the end of the clip digs into your side if you have the unit on your waistband
1	my baby had very bad reflux and pediatrician told us not to move her to her room , my fear was that she would get use to sleep in our bedroom and moving her became a nightmare . when reflux got better at month 4 we finally got to move her and for us this monitor became a very useful tool , it has rechargeable batteries , image and sound are clear enough , night vision works perfect , monitor is not bulky at all ( no color at all though ) , and we managed to tie camera to the crib 's headboard and worked great for us .
1	this monitor is pretty good . it pick up my little one 's little noises so i can get to her before she awakens . it does have a clicking sound with it if the reception in less then 4 bars ( which it is less then 4 bars most of the time as my house is long ) . i do have high praise for the fisher price exchange service . i had bought a monitor before my little one was born and so therefor did n't use it until after the 30 day return allowance from amazon was up . then after about 6 hours of use the monitor stopped working . i was able to send it to fisher-price and they exchanged it in less then ten days ! ( no questions asked
1	i bought this for my second son who is a year old . i love it . it 's compact and fits easily in the diaper bag . after he eats , i take it to the restroom and it rinses right off . i 've started using it at home too because the little tray in the front catches food really well ( and saves my floors ! ) . i recommend anyone who hates to see their child rub their food all over the germy table buy this ! !
0	i bought this chair used and i do n't think it 's worth the $ 50 i paid for it . i also have the fisher price chair ( i have twins ) and that one is so much better - i wish i had 2 of those . first , like everyone has said , it is ridiculous to clean . those people who said it 's easy to clean must either not be really cleaning it or have babies that make very little mess . gross food particles collect in every crease and corner , especially under the seat . most importantly , the tray is way too high - even at 1 yrs old my girls are uncomfortable reaching food on it and they are an average height/weight . the tray also does n't come close enough so there is a big gap between the baby and the chair - not dangerous but perfect for all the food to fall through and collect in the sides of the chair and on the lap . finally , the tray is too big for an average size dishwasher so must always be washed by hand . the fp high chair tray can go right into the dishwasher . only buy this chair if the only thing you care about is how it looks
1	i love these little books ... they play music.. good for before bed , my girls can chew on them ( which makes both me and my two year old son happy ) ... just fantastic ... great buy
1	a great success . i love all kiddapotamus products , that i bought so far because they are well-done , thoughtful and win awards all the time - but best of all , they are really very handy . we went to a restaurant and for the first time we could put our sons food right on the placemat on the table so that he could feed himself . without that mat , we had to hold onto the food or but a napkin underneath - so one of us was always busy with our son instead of enjoying a dinner out . the placemat comes with a scoop that holds most of the food that our son will drop from his mat and the floor was still clean after we left . best of all with this mat we can provide a germfree space for him to sit , eat and play - on our table . he was really happy about it . after our visit we rolled this wonderful placemat together and put it in my handbag . i was really satisfied
0	the ideas for the bottles interchanging is great . but unfortunately the nipples cause too much gas . when they 're using the bottle , you can hear constant air sucking in around their lips . every time my little girl uses them , it seems as though she just ca n't get comfortable with them . i would recommend dr.brown 's or playtex ventaire bottles over any of these . ultimately , the convenience and features are n't worth the massive amount of gas the avent bottles cause
1	i used one of these 24 inch extensions to cover a 90 inch space . the kidco configure gate contains three 24 inch pieces ( i.e . 72 inches total ) , so if you need extra length , you can purchase 8 or 24 inch extensions to customize your gate to any length . the extension was easy to use and is very sturdy . the gate looks uniformed and you can not tell it is several separate pieces . the only 'issue ' is you have to connect the extensions to either the section w/the door ( i.e . 24 inch section with the open/close swing door ) or use it as an end piece . i was not able to continously connect extensions to one another ( not sure if i did this incorrectly or not . ) but nonetheless , the extension worked fine and i love my new gate
0	i registered for this sling , and was thrilled when i received it as a shower gift . i could n't wait to use it . when my son was about 3 weeks old , i tried to put him in it . we both instantly hated it . its far too bulky to use with an infant , and it does n't adjust small enough to fit my frame ( i 'm 5'6 '' and far from skinny ) . i kept it , thinking that my son would eventually fit in it , and perhaps as he got bigger i 'd be able to wear it . wrong . i wish i 'd brought it back when i could still return it . my son is now 11 months old and we still ca n't use this sling . there 's no way he can sit in it securely . he hates being held but ca n't walk yet so i was really hoping we could use this , but it still does n't fit me , and my 24 pound son is n't held safely in it . he can wiggle his way out in less than 3 seconds . i 'm expecting again , and hoping i can find something much better than this for this baby
1	i like this product very much . it is very soft , unlike the other tubs where i was scared that my son would hit his head . the only drawback i have about is the belt ... .maybe in the next one they can come up with a good belt that would hold the infant . other than that i would recommend it to anyone . it looks very comfortable too . especially if you have taller babies this is the best bathing system
1	i breast fed my son for a year in 2003 with the medela pump back then . i trusted medela to pick up this one for my daughter this year . i pump once a day , so they get used , but not abused . the model has changed some , i think it is more powerful this time . the thing i do n't like , but certainly can live with , is the motor not being attached to the breast shield . my chest is rather large , so putting the bottles in the unit and holding the unit to my chest with one hand is not an option . i have to hold each shield upto my chest and the motor sits in my lap . i ca n't control the speed or turn the unit on/off because i do n't have a free hand . i leave the speed where i need it before and take the bottle off while it 's still on and put it in the bottle holder while i turn the unit off . i still very much like this product as it gets the job done
1	we received the original co-sleeper as a gift . we also considered getting a mini co-sleeper and a pack'n'play or similar playard . the main advantage of the co-sleeper is that you can attach it to your bed so you can reach your baby without getting up . the original co-sleeper can also be used as a playard . the playard capacity is up to 50 pounds , most brands are only rated to 30 lb . similarly the bassinet level rating is 30 lb . and most brands go to 15 . the co-sleeper itself is about 2 or 3 pounds heavier than a typical playard . the width is 28 '' so the co-sleeper can go through our 29 '' doorways without collapsing , unlike several playards that are around 31 '' . there is a trick to collapsing the top bars - you have to pull the bar upwards when you press the buttons , then it 's easy . ( otherwise you can push until your thumbs are purple and nothing happens ) this is explained on their website and should have been included in the manual . i had a lot of reservations after reading other reviews here but am glad i chose to keep the co-sleeper and expect it to use it constantly . also , the arm 's reach canopy is really strong and beautiful and i 'm confident it 'll keep the cats out
0	sometimes you just have to spend the money to get the superior product . buy from pottery barn and order additional covers from them as well . same pillow but the fleece-like cover exclusively at pottery barn is actual `` luxury . '' more comfortable for mom and baby . wears amazingly well due to thickness and stains lift right out . we have used one cover continuously for over 4 months and it 's still like new . in another class from the `` chintzie '' alternatives offered at other stores
1	i have a climber ! she could climb out of her crib at age 13 months . she was way too young for a bed . we also have the crib tent ii and both items have allowed us to feel our now 22 month old daughter is safely in her crib at night -- not roaming her room or house while we sleep . it was either these products or emptying all the furniture out of her room , putting a mattress on the floor , and putting a lock on her door at night to keep her safe . life saver
1	i bought this backpack after reading several of the other reviews and i am glad i did ! i did some shopping around at local stores and all of the other backpacks i found were either much more expensive or were the same price but had fewer features . my 7 month old daughter loves this backpack . in addition , we do n't need the diaper bag because it has so many pockets . i did not have any trouble putting on the sun visor and the backpack is very easy to store and use . i originally bought this backpack to take abroad in place of a stroller but i can see that it is going to be handy in places like the zoo and grocery shopping as well . i do n't know how it would do for serious campers , but for every day use it has been great .
0	leaking , slipping , ca n't use over the kitchen sink . horrible design .
0	this machine is not loud enough , i have 2 machines this one that is in the babies room and a different machine ( made by lifewise ) in my boys room ... .my boys sleep through anything , the dog , the door bell ... whatever it is ... but this machine just does n't cut it unless you live in a sound proof house..
1	i have n't traveled with the bag yet , but the quality seems good . the bag has a cloth-like exterior and the interior fabric is a thick vinal . my stroller is a pram style one where the handle bar can reverse and is oversized . the stroller fits in the bag with 2 wheels off from the same side because of the thin long ends of the bag ( the top thin long end is where the zipper is ) . they are removable wheels , so its no problem . with all the wheels on , the bag ca n't zip closed . that is why i gave it only 4 stars . i bought the bag because i will be traveling overseas soon and i do n't want my stroller damaged during the long flight .
0	i bought this thermometer and liked it but after i used it a few times the buttons stopped working and i could n't turn it off . i opened it to remove the battery and found that it had water in it . a bath thermometer should at least be waterproof
0	i bought this stroller for when we had our second child . my children are 19 mo . apart . i had the aria single stroller for my first and loved it . this one is definitely not the same . for one thing , it is very hard to steer and get over bumps . the wheels are always getting stuck . second , it is hard to close . the most frustrating part is the steering issue . also , my aria decal fell off as well many months ago . i 've only had the stroller for nine months . one more thing , the canopy to block out the sun is basically worthless since it offers very little protection from the sun .
1	i liked this positioner because it came with an adjustable head piece . my baby kept wiggling up to the top of the headboard and this piece kept him from doing so . i also liked the fact that as my baby grew wider i could adjust the wedges . one more thing this comes with a mat . this saved me from changing the sheet because he puked up so much . i bought two and would flipp flopp them when he would get sick
1	i bought this pump after the avent isis failed me along with an electric pump . the fact that this pump puts so much control over suction power in my hands is great . im able to empty each breast in 15 min or less sometimes . although its a little loud it is a manual pump and all manual pumps are a little noisy . from reading the other reviews i think that alot of other mothers expected results from this pump that just arent reasonable . remember most manual pumps arent for constant expressing purposes or for bringing in milk supply . if you read tegh package the manufacturer even says that they recommend the pump for emptying breasts occasionally like when spending time away from baby or breastfeeding moms who express once or twice a day so others can feed baby . and they discourage it for working moms who have to pump everyday .
0	my 8 1/2 mo . granddaughter got her leg stuck between the bars in the middle of the night . i 've got the correct bumper pads , etc . but babies do move . she had bruises on her ankle and was throwing up she was so upset . i 've only had the crib 1 week , she 's gotten her leg stuck 2 times . we caught it within minutes and it frightens me to think that she could have gone longer .
1	when we got our changing table from a friend who no longer needed it ... they gave us the diaper depot as well . i love how it puts everything at an arms reach without clutting the changing table . it has lasted two kids before the one it 's on now , so a total of three babies . i guess like anything if it 's taken care of properly it wo n't break
0	i received this sheet and was immediately disappointed . the quality is very cheap and it was n't a perfect fit . i am surprised that this is made by graco - usually their products are good . i would not recommend buying this . i would buy a regular crib sheet instead .
