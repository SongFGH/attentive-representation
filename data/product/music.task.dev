1	this cd reminds me once again why russian liturgical music is one of the treasures of the world : beautiful , profound , awe-inspiring , uplifting . for the most part , the pieces are well chosen and the performances excellent . i am delighted to see that many of the tracks are from the classic recording of the rachmaninoff vespers made in the early 1970s by the ussr ministry of culture chamber choir directed by valery polyansky , and released in the usa by angel-melodiya . i wore out my copy of the lp years ago ; although it has been reissued on cd , it 's out of print and very hard to find . so it is wonderful to see a generous selection from that recording available on this disk . listen to track 11 , `` praise the lord o my soul '' , sung by the chamber choir and mezzo irina arkhipova . you would have to have a heart of stone not to be moved as she sings `` slava ghospidin '' ( praise to the lord ) . and listen to how the basses descend to b-flat at end . it just does n't get any better than this
0	with the exception of `` my heart will go on '' by celine dion , horner 's soundtrack is not a masterpiece but a bunch of stinking skunks who are masked by a field of sweet smelling flowers . for a soundtrack score it is not riveting and really lacks any emotional connection to the film . overall it is just really overrated and the hit single got played so much that the masses just fell into a typical zombie trance and went marching to the store to buy it . this was after they kept returning to the theater to see a fictional tale of love built around a tragic , awful event . it did n't stop them though ; they could not get enough of seeing all those depictions of people freezing to death in the water . overall a below average soundtrack that road the coat tails of a hit single that was shoved down our throats for an entire year
1	if you like music you ca n't help but like mariachi from mexico . it is superb . is there another volume ? if so , tell me about it
0	ok , at long last public enemy has finally let me down by allowing a bunch of sub-par average , non-innovative , non-avent guard , dj 's mix there stuff up . even dj spookie 's mix was not that grand . everything sounds like beats that i discovered in the early 90 's . on the other hand , this album is only a couple bucks used , so i would highly highly highly suggest buying it if only for 54321 boom which is perhaps one of the best pe tracks ever to come out ! not only are the beats right on , but the lyrics are some of the hardest i 've heard yet ! and for the note , my review has nothing to do with me not being flexable to change of sound . infact i love the new pe ( whirl odor ) even though it has club friendly sounds , mainly for the fact that they are not your mere average club beats ( they are very multi-layered ) and of course the lyrics once again only get harder and harder and harder , and more direct and to the point as we aproach the last times of this world ( lyness )
1	this is without doubt the most beautiful , moving song i have ever heard . i cry every time i listen to it . i will ask my family to have it played at my funeral . the lyrics and symbolism are born of emotional genius . the solo vocalist and the instrumentation are flawless . this selection is the hope diamond of contemporary music
0	the problem with america was that started out great . the first album was fresh and different from everything . three young boys and accoustic quitars was a song all it own . `` horse with no name '' and `` sandman '' , was what pave the way for them . the problem was that each album after that they got farther away from their roots and into the middle of mainstream pop . they should of left `` muskrat love . '' to the captain and tennille . this album does a fine job of showing their career from beginning to end . the problem was that there was their first two albums , ( america and venture highway ) and there was their others . my recommandation would be to pick up the first 2 and leave this for the die hard fans
0	i do not understand why people are so waxing poetic about this album . there is nothing new or 'fresh ' or 'original ' or at all thought-brovoking about this music , unless you happen to be easily pleased by any simple pseudo-pop sound . i have only recently discovered the world of no-wave music , but i was introduced to it through artists like arab on radar and scissor girls . so when i tried out my first sonic youth album , i was way more than dissapointed . i do n't know how this can be classified as no-wave anymore . sure they show some trait in a few wailing off key guitars and an occasioinal shouted spoken word , but they are all only half-assed and are muddled up in cliche indie pop love tunes that have only been done in every other band . the most notable anything is the catchy medlody of becuz . it is really catchy , yet it managaes to be unique enough to rise above the typical `` catchy tunes '' ethos . xiu xiu 's `` knife play '' would probably be considered more of a pop/no-wave sound that does not sacrifice the aggressive anti-music drive of no-wave ... and still retain the emotional pop sinsibility . i do n't know.. all i know is that wasing machine is a letdown . it does not reach me artistically by a long shot . emotionally , i can think of am million other artists ( mars volta , emerson lake palmer , clouddead , ulver , edvard greig ! ) who can put me on a much higher cloud and help me get in touch with the human condition . this however is far to cheezy , and i do n't know , but i think it reeks of that shallow indie fashion clique..
1	this is a great cd . back where i come from , is on of those feel good songs that gives me chill bumps every time i here it . chesney is a extremely talented artist whose passion is shown in every song . i recommend all his albums
1	this mos def album is a good album to listen to . he shows off his lyrical skills and gives social commentary that is on point . why listen to a bunch of guys who have `` lil '' in front of their names when you can listen to a man give his views on life , love , and this country we live i
0	listening to this c.d . first gave me a headache , then it made my stomache churn . it is so uninspired , it 's not even funny ( or listenable ) . yeah , it 's loud , but i can be loud , too , if i had some pots and pans and a `` guitar . '' do n't get this , it 's nothing but d-r-i-v-e-l
0	boston have to be one of the worst bands ever ! ! the singer screams and they made some of the lousiest songs like rock n roll band , and the horrible more than a feeling . they would not hold a candle to smart bands like metallica who rock ! i just got metallica 's 4th lp today . get and justice for all by metallica insted
1	these 3 discs ( there is a limited edition 10 disc set which has obviously sold out ! ! ) are a continuation of live dead . if you have n't heard the dead live then start with this or live dead . you will realise why to many they were america 's greatest improvisational rock band . the playing , the interplay between the musicians - particularly garcia and lesh is staggering . and how about a big hand for bill kreutzman on drums
0	i just purchased my sacd player and picked up boston and billy joel 's the stranger at the same time . after listening to the stranger , my mouth dropped . billy 's voice coming from the center speaker and all the other instruments and melodies coming from every different direction . then i put in boston and could n't tell a difference from the cd version i already own . i think it 's one of the best albums , but if you already own it on cd , do n't bother upgrading - there 's nothing special about the sacd version
1	i have seen joe many years ago when he had played in a group called bloodline and he is even better now
1	this cd has tons of power , and soothing energy . it really shows off how well part understands the human voice
1	rien a dire si ce n'est que too $ hort et ses potes Ã§a claque c'est tout
0	being an osmond fan can be very frustrating at times ... this cd has nothing new to offer . there have been several osmond compilation cds in the past 10 years . what 's so different about this one besides the photograph on the cover ? nothing . i agree with the reviewer who wishes the osmonds would put some of their old albums on cd instead of putting out hit compilation cds all the time . been there . done that . bored to tears
1	its just realy sad that hip-hop dont sound like hard to earn anymore ... gang starr still gets daily airplay on my stereo and im glad i support these guys
0	the lack of someone lurking behind prince 's shoulder while in the recording studio and having the courage to tell him when he produces second rate nonsense has been missing since the departure of the fargnoli management team . this is a poor track incorporating biblical references that have little relevance or sense of genuine compassion to the katrina disaster . musically the lack of emotion conveyed by the unnecessarily complicated chord changes and irrelevant reference to sade also make the feel of this track disjointed . while prince fans will generally hype this track , the reality is that `` 4 the tears in your eyes '' this is n't and to add a charity track with an instrumental showing off your musical skills is just pure self indulgence and frankly crass . lets hope this is not an indication of the upcoming 3121 .
1	anais is one of the best cingers . i have seen her since objetivo fama , and she is just great . do n't listen to people who say this cd is bad because the are just hating . this cd is just great
1	i have to admit that , at first listening , i found some aspects of ms.belle 's interpretations of these pieces disorienting . however , as i listened to these covers repeatedly , i can now say that i understand better what the vocalist is after . not that i always agree with her and with george duke , the arranger/producer , but i agree with their choices and their totally new project and enjoy having had my horizons broadened . ms.belle has immense talent , superb technique , and a clear idea of each piece , and she delivers the goods without faltering or compromise . i admire that a lot in a performer . her choices ask us for a reaction and we are free to accept or reject what she has offered us . when i first heard these renditions , i was quite stand-offish , but over time i have come to appreciate them more and more - almost to the point of addiction - and am grateful to regina and george for their strength of conviction as well as their superior musicianship.they do not want us to listen in a passive way , they are waiting for our reaction..and god , this is really so , so good ... .that 's the true spirit in which an album should be recorded . i 'd encourage you to get this album because it is about strong , powerful and personal interpretations of some great jazz standards by regina . you may love everything about it , or you may reject aspects of her interpretations . but in any case you will not remain indifferent ; you will be enriched by hearing these pieces in a clear and beautifully personal way . that is an important aspect of why i love this imaginative , innovative quality music and why this recording is invaluable . and it can not be said enough that her backing band is incredible , giving this album the necessary push to take it over the edge . it is a success because it skilfully avoids being categorized . regina has had the courage to break out of the traditional mould and make a successful cross-over , which some purists may not approve of ... only time will tell ... .
1	i just purchased this album , my first misfits album and every song on it rocks ( i especially like where eagles dare ) . i just bought two more albums , walk among us and static age and i wish they would hurry up and get here in the mail because i cant wait . my only complain is the sound quality . it sounds like they put a dollar store tape recorder in the corner and started rocking ... but i guess that makes it sound more real too . metallica covered a couple of their albums on their garage album but it just isnt the same .
0	this whole post crap grunge is crap . if you want real rock check out gnr , acdc , and any band pre grunge . i know this is a review but how does this grab ya . oh and i wo n't mention the thousands of stupid bands that sing like their trying to go to go to the bathroom . `` oh how did we wind up like this ? '' exactly what i 'm trying to figure out . tesla 's got more talent then all these bands and they ca n't get any airplay give me a break
0	if any kid music annoys you , this cd is not for you . these are good old classic songs , but almost ruined with strange styles and irrelevant talking to intro the songs . i 'm throwing it away . i want my two-year-old to know the songs i know and love , but this was a bad buy on my part .
0	even as dedicated of a radiohead fan as i am , i really do n't care much for this album . i say thank goodness for `` creep '' because we may have never heard from them again ( or at least not in the same way ) if that song had not become as popular as it did
0	i loved shedaisy 's first album the whole shebang . and i also really enjoy their christmas albumn . they have beautiful voices and i love the three part harmonies they come up with . i was very excited to get their newest album but i was sure dissapointed . this is a very dark and depressing album . almost every song is about lost love . also , all the songs but 1 are slow . where is the upbeat shedaisy i fell in love with ? ? ? i would suggest passing this one up and instead just listening to the whole shebang again . still , i look forward to what the future may bring from them . these sisters have alot of talent
1	the soundtrack is great but some of the good songs from the movie arent on it . overall it is a good produc
0	carter burwell 's soundtrack music to `` rob roy '' was an early sign that he was not just getting it right . the score is all wrong but so is the movie . this movie needed an uplifting score . carter burwell could not deliver it
1	i got ta be honest , when i first listened to this album i was dissapointed . but like any truly amazing album , it just took some decoding , listening to the songs multiple times reaaaallly helps to appreciate what these guys are doing . essentially , gat are four people who are amazing at what they do , and we should feel lucky that they have found a way to mesh together perfectly . their first album , emphasizer , blew me away , but i felt it lost steam around halfway through . this album does no such thing , and what is more impressive is that this is an all acoustic album , which means skerik is using the natural sound of his sax as opposed to the various effects that he is known for . this gives the album a much more natural feel and it shows that these four are able to make amazing music without any wizardry in the production department . but dont get me wrong , this cd sounds amazing . anyway , i saw them live last night in nyc , and they blew my mind ... i recommend this cd to anyone , and see them live if you get the rare opportunity !
1	as a fan of both celtic traditional and bluegrass music i was wary of a cd claiming to be a hybrid - too often it means an unsatisfactory compromise where original flavours become watered down and insipid . i need not have worried - tim o'brien has produced one of the most amazing and rewarding musical journeys i 've followed for some time . not only do the players from the two traditions blend instinctively and harmoniously but the tracks , mostly songs , are marvellous vehicles for new and exciting directions . there are superb performances all round , vocally from o'brien with guests paul brady , maura o'connell , kathhy mattea , del mccoury etc and musicians altan , frankie gavin , jerry douglas , earl scruggs , seamus egan and a host of others and the sound is fresh , acoustic and vital , requiring no production gimmicks or effects . standout songs for me personally are `` mountaineer is always free '' , `` lost little children '' , `` wandering '' and `` john riley '' although there is not a weak track on the cd . it is obvious that for tim o'brien this has been a labour of love . if you like acoustic music , from any tradition , either side of the atlantic , you 'll love it . several of my friends have bought it on my recommendation and agree it is brilliant
0	with the caliber of musicians playing on this album , i expected a hard hitting original . instead we get re-arranged covers and lots of `` filler '' salsa . no surprises here . the classic salsa albums are worth your cash but if you are curious , you 'll play this one once
1	the title gets it right - this is a very fun album . there are a lot of great songs on here . infectious lyrics and music - it still surprises me that matthew sweet is n't more popular than he is . one other thing ... it 's a sin that `` we 're the same '' was n't a bigger hit than it was . truly a great song
1	this disc dates from monk 's early period before he achieved recognition and started to descend into a long series of formulaic recordings for columbia . so it 's valuable from that point of view . it 's also a wonderful chance to hear him showcased without horns although the standard is perhaps not quite as high as the trio blue note recordings that immediately preceded it . the best tracks both from a musical and recording quality view point are an extended blue monk , which many consider the definitive version , and a lovely unaccompanied just a gigolo , which anticipates later solo masterpieces such as alone in san francisco . sweet and lovely is in a similarly reflective vein . much of the rest of the album has a forceful , driving quality , with aggressive use of dissonance in places - even for monk . a particular highlight is monk tearing through these foolish things
1	thoroughly enjoyed the cd . have some of the songs as performed by other artists , but it 's nice to hear them as performed by the writer . i 'm always impressed by one with that kind of creativity .
0	just like in my other review i ca n't figure out the madness over these guys . i will ask in this post as well for somebody to actually explain to me why they should be heard and are relevant in a creative way . honestly people you ca n't call these guys artists . an artist creates something from a idea or two these guys take those ideas and just lump them together . it 's as simple as that . and to top it of they do n't have the chops as musicians to be relevant in that form either . a comment like `` they rock '' or `` the lead singer is soooo hot '' are n't examples of a great artist or band . from the dates of the last post my words might be in vain , kind of like the validity of this record . because there has n't been a post on here for two years . if a fan of banking benjamins does stumble upon this post i invite you to check out my other reviews , and checkout some relevant and great music
1	... else if michigan was on vinyl i would have worn it out by now . illinois was my first venture into the sound-world of sufjan stevens , and no doubt it his most impressive outing to date . however the subtle spendour of the earlier michigan has ousted it as my favourite . perhaps less eclectic and entertaining than illinois , but more soulful and beautiful . ultimately it 's the one i 'd take to the proverbial desert island . there 's not a single track in this 74 minute cd that i 'd want to skip or drop from my mp3 playlist , but highlights for me are romulus ( gentle and heartbreaking ) , sleeping bear ( musically gorgeous ) , and vito 's ordination song ( like being gently hugged ) . p.s . so often the 'bonus tracks ' on a cd can seem superfluous and substandard but the 2 extras on my cd ( marching band and pickerel lake ) are both excellent .
0	i like meav 's voice , and this cd is ok , if you like this kind of stuff . think slow and somewhat depressing . i think irish music has moved on so much since bill whehlan of riverdance brought it into the modern times , and came up with this vocal sound , i guess to hark back to earlier times , which worked well because riverdance has so much contrast in it and the choir songs only appear as relief to the other music . this is all a bit samey and dull . i would say saved by this lady 's fine voice though
0	you win some and you lose some . this purchase was a definite loss . what a dissapointment
1	while not dissimilar to other excellent acts such as coldplay , keane , and pete yorn , travis have distinguished themselves as a band with their own unique style and sound . this , their 2nd album , is the best of their music : melodic throughout , with catchy tunes , solid lyrics , and tremendous guitar work that captures the listener from the first chords of 'sing ' to the fade-out from 'the humpty dumpty love song ' . if you buy an album once you know three or four or more of its songs are excellent , then i confidently recommend the invisible band to you . rating each song individually for one 's ipod : 1 . sing , side , the cage , afterglow and the humpty dumpty love song are each worthy of four to five stars 2 . pipe dreams , flowers in the window , safe , follow the light , and indefinitely are three to four star songs 3 . the balance are two to three stars each . the only poor effort is probably `` last train '' , which is too plodding relative to its counterparts the invisible band is basically a healthy mix of folksy , hopeful songs mixed with just the right amount of melancholy . nowhere is this better reflected than in 'the humpty dumpty love song ' , which defines this mix perfectly . while this is the best of the album , the rest is well worth listening to repeatedly . highly recommended
1	i used to listen to a friend 's copy of the original `` metal box '' of ep 's , when it first came out . years later the `` second edition '' came out on lp 's for those of us who had n't sprung for the metal box before it sold out . eventually the second edition came out on this cd . so i finally could own a digital copy myself . pristine , audio quality at least as good as the original metal box in my opinion , if i remember correctly . you do need to listen to this . you do need to buy a copy and get other people to listen to this too
1	this cd is soo cool ! ! i love all the songs ! they are all good efforts . i especially like mr. coffee you have got ta hear that song ! other than that this is a great cd ! ! buy it today ! ! you 'll enjoy i
1	this album is a classic , but its really short . dead prez are the best duo in rap in my opinion . i highly recommend this and all of dead prez 's other albums
1	with all the 'neuvo flamenco ' and its accompaning popularity . it is nice ( and a relief ) i might add , to hear the flamenco guitar in its purist form . not only does this cd contain sabicas and nino ricardo . it also contains four very rare perfomances by manolo de huelva . which are difficult to find anywhere . also included are melchor de marchena performing six pieces . this is truly pure flamenco at its best
0	based on the reviews for this cd i decided to buy it without having sampled it . big mistake . i love , among others , marshall crenshaw , don dixon and peter holsapple , but what happened here ? this was so not fabulous
0	although prince is an utter genious ! this cd is merely a boring contract filler . i suggest you buy one of his older albums or the new album `` musicology '' instead
0	the schumann that is presented here is a forgery . do n't get me wrong . i 'm not railing against schumann at all . the question here is what makes schumann great , and the way that bernstein presents these symphonies says schumann is great for the wrong reasons . the real schumann that lived was a completely different person than what we might assume from listening to this particular presentation of his music . schumann was not a hopeless romantic . he was one composer in a long line of `` classicists '' which ended with brahms , yet at the same time he was an innovator , pushing forward , trying to find new stylistic and technical means of expression . he had plenty of dignity , and he did n't write his music as a desperate plea for the world to like him , which is exactly what it sounds like here . bernstein trudges through these fine works as if he were dying . yes , many of these performances are the slowest on record , but this is a bad thing . these beautiful works lose value immeasurably when they are saturated with thick , waxy , overly romantic textures and phrasing . tell me , did schumann ever write : `` to be played extremely histrionically and melodramatically , with the greatest possible amount of cheese and theatrics '' in his score ? no ! he did not . these performances are not more expressive than others in the real sense of the word , and any person in his/her right mind should be able to see this . you may be able to hear the orchestration more clearly than in karajan 's filth , but that 's not saying much at all . and for this slight favor bernstein does for the music , he makes it infinitely worse when he stretches the fabric of these works beyond their limit . the most blatant example is the third movement of the second symphony , taken at half tempo . all semblance of melody and motion is lost . this movement is supposed to be several minutes shorter than the first , and not the longest movement of the symphony , not to mention the longest movement in the entire set . in fact , almost every movement of every symphony could stand to have at least a minute hacked off of its timing . also , while looking at the scores , you might notice that bernstein does away with detail work this time around . carefully laid out phrasing and the dynamic arch are thrown out of the window in favor of grand `` romantic '' gestures . observing details in schumann , ironically , helps to make the music speak more freely and honestly . this is n't honest music-making here , only a self-indulgent conductor once again plastering his image over the face of great art
1	this is a great collection of hits from the 70 's . it is packed with hits . it is a great addition to a 70 's hits collection
0	i gave this a good listen , but did not find it all that funny ... or memorable
1	no collection of blues/rock is complete without `` a piece of your soul '' . there very simply is not a weak track on the entire disc . from the raunchy ( `` bitter rain '' ) to the uplifting ( `` good day for the blues '' ) to the bittersweet ( `` cynical '' ) to the soft ( `` share that smile '' ) storyville encompasses the entire range of musical expression with a style that is as provocative as it is unique . put this disc on your list of music to have on a deserted island
0	michael jackson is one of the most gifted songwriters/singers of our time . you can discuss his person , you can discuss his behaviour , and all the other stuff , but you ca n't really take that away from him . and that 's exactly why this album is so unacceptable , coming from someone like him - when you 've reached superstardom and gone beyond it , you do n't release a record that 's so horribly mixed up and full of second grade tracks that it 's bound to be a faliure . at least , you should expect to hear for it . and hear for it he did , cause the critics did n't go lightly on this one . and it 's not that bad , actually . i mean , that 's what i have my program function in my cd-player for , and my cd-burner . the album starts on a fair streak - unbreakable , heartbreaker and invincible - are all fair tracks - below average for mj , sounds like a watered down selection of discarded tracks from dangerous that were then discarded for history and then discarded for blood on the dance floor , and full of badly placed guest rappers to top it off - but apart from that , if you forget who made this music , these are actually good , funky dance tracks . for michael jackson they 're passable , but nothing more . *skip* on to track 8 - speechless - arguably the strongest moment on the record . one of only two tracks that jackson actually penned himself , and it shows . the amount of emotion in his voice will knock you prone , and actually proves very well what the rest of the album lacks : joy for the music , and personal emotion . the lyrics are like a poem , and one of the most beautiful love declarations in all their simplicity . top grade to jackson for this one track , and if you are into his music , buy the cd cheeply just to get this track . track 9 - 2000 watts - is another of the stronger moments of the record . this one is simply plain fun , and that 's another important lesson jackson should have lurned - to let go of the reigns , and stop caring whether it 's hip or street or down with the trend - because it is n't - but this is darn good pop music , and nigh irresistable . *skip* on to track 13 - cry - penned by r. kelley . the same r. kelley who is guilty of writing one of the most horrible songs of all times ( i believe i can fly , if you had doubts ) , but it seems that with jackson , he can do no wrong . he wrote the endearing you are not alone - major hit in europe - and this track is possibly even better . oh , forget about the sappy lyrics , and just enjoy the wonderfull music . this is pop writing in top class , and if jackson sounds like he takes the marthyr role a bit too seriously , it 's still one of the best tracks on the record . track 14 - the lost children - is the other song penned by michael alone , and it 's not a bad effort - had it not been for the children choir and sleezy intro , you could probably have ignored the lyrics and enjoyed a nice pop tune . as it is , it falls somewhat flat , and becomes completely choking in the end - but yes , it 's a nice tune . thumps up , mr. jackson . track 15 - whatever happens . ok , that 's one weird track . michael jackson featuring santane . wtf ? well , kudos for doing this , and it actually works , in a sort of absurd way . not single potential , and not a classic , but it 's not embarassing , and as an album filler , it 's completely acceptable as a cureosity . well , what about the rest of it then ? lead single you rock my world was never my favorite - the spoken intro is downright embarassing - but the track is not bad . i can accept that on the record . the same is not true for the horrible ballads break of dawn , heaven can wait , butterflies , you are my life and do n't walk away . one is worse than the next , and every time i just try to listen to them , i start chocking to the degree of loosing my last meal . yes , it 's that bad , no really , it 's horrible . i . ca n't . stand . these . songs . period . there are simply no redeeming qualities for me . and then the two monstrosities - privacy and threatened - that just sound like a very - very - bad joke on the man himself . tabloid junkie from history actually worked , because it packed a great punch , and well , had not been heart before . well it had been , it was pretty much the same as why you wan na trip on me from dangerous , but still . it worked . ghosts was a good track of blood on the dance floor . forget about the movie that was - well , embarassing . but the music was good . these tracks are n't . they sound dated , repetitive , out of place and utterly boring and uninspired . get over it jackson , we do n't want to hear more about the media nagging you , it 's not going to make them go away . well , all in all , what do we have ... to take the album from a to z : unbreakable - 6/10 - a fair dance track . heartbreaker - 6/10 - same . invincible - 6/10 - same . break of dawn - 0/10 - horrible r'n'b overproduced . vomit . heaven can wait - 0/10 - same . you rock my world - 5/10 - well , at least it sounds new . butterflies - 0/10 - more vomit . speechless - 10/10 - the flower in the dirt . one true mj song . 2000 watts - 8/10 - very enjoyable , and stands out tall compared to the rest . you are my life - 0/10 - even more vomit . privacy - 2/10 - yawn . repetitive and dated . do n't walk away - 0/10 - end of vomit . cry - 9/10 - beautiful showmanship , kelly + jackson works - again . the lost children - 6/10 - well , it has potential . whatever happens - 7/10 - interesting , and well , refreshing , if somewhat strange . threatened - 2/10 - same as privacy , and exactly as boring . this yields and average about 3.6/10 , or 2/5 stars , which actually matches my fealings for this album fairly well . yes , i 'm harsh , but from a man as gifted as jackson , you just expect more . quality control next time , please , mr. jackson . on the bottom line : outtakes the way you love me and we 've had enough showed up on the 2004 ultimate collection and outranked 2/3 of this album by far . go figure
0	do you know why this double cd is often in the bargain basement ? simply because it is an inferior product . for some very odd reason , the compiler at the record company decided to put 13 live songs instead of the studio versions that we all remember . for all we know , it may have been a copyright problem . i bought this for my dad about 5 years ago , but we were both unaware of the live recordings until we played it . the live recordings on this cd are dismal and not related to the awesome `` hot august night '' . fortunately for me , i own the right neil diamond cd 's which contain the studio versions . these are still available . the first is called `` 12 greatest hits '' ( a black and white photo a young neil ) , and the second is called `` 12 greatest hits volume 2 '' ( a colour photo of neil sitting on a sofa ) . both of these contain all the studio versions - and not one live recording in sight ! ! ! just released is a new compilation called neil diamond gold , as part of the gold series but i do not know if it too contains the dreadful live recordings . all i know is that it is missing a lot of key tracks
1	some of the catchiest melodies and harmonies ever from curt . lots of cool instrumentation . pete anderson did a great job with the production . this has n't left my cd player since i got it 4 days ago
0	this cd is pretty awful , you wonder why leona even got the chance to record a cd , one of the worst songs ever is calling , , it sounds like taunting from elementary school kids on the playground , na na na na , na na na na , i agree with the reviewer who said she is a very weak edie brickell sounding singer ... ... ..
0	i absolutely love charlotte church 's voice , but i could n't stand even 1 song on this cd . she 's lowered herself to a `` brittany spears-wanna-be . '' monotone songs , horrible bass , every song sounds the same . i am extremely disappointed in this collection of music . buy this one and you 're just wasting your money . would the real charlotte church please come back ? ? ? ?
0	i really really really really like allison moorer . have been a fan since her first record , have road-tripped to see her numerous times , and love her songwriting and singing . that said -- `` getting somewhere '' is by far the least satisfying of her records . no memorable songs . over-produced . no `` guts '' , as another reviewer said . when the allison moorer/doyle `` butch '' primm songwriting team called it quits ( in more ways than one ) , their lennon/mccartney-caliber teamwork was lost . not that moorer sounds like the beatles , but allison and butch complemented each other well when composing music . this cd is not only unmemorable but i doubt i would care to ever listen to it again . such a shame . i 've never had anything negative to say about allison in the 8 years i 've been a fan . but this cd left me cold . it hurts a bit to say this , but i can not recommend this cd . the closest analogy i can think of that relates to how different this cd is from her earlier work is the b-story line from an episode of `` the larry sanders show '' . in that episode , sanders ' head writer phil ( played by wallace langham ) finally got himself a girlfriend and was happy . as a result he lost his edge . when he was a miserable person he was an edgy , cynical , funny jokewriter . when he was a happy person he stopped being the kind of funny that he needed to be to do his job . same with moorer . since her recent changes in her social life she has started `` singing a sweeter tune '' in her life , but it came with a cost . she does n't seem to be the same songwriter anymore and it was that `` other '' songwriter who was so good -- a little edgy , sad , sometimes bitter , or at least that 's how i interpreted it . granted , that was n't her entire oeuvre , but it is what made her songs special for me . now she 's happy and she might as well be writing songs for barney the dinosaur
1	jeff beck is far from the typical rock guitarist . he never took the easy path of showing how fast or virtuoso he is . instead , he is full of intriguing and explosive ideas that make you want to listen to this cd over and over again . that 's what musicianship is all about , and jeff has plenty of it
0	i just want to slap who ever keeps coming out with these.hard.okay , there are some song that deserve this.to be ruined by off key 10-year-olds with annoying high squeaky voices.but come on ! they killed 'my immortal ' ! that is a beautiful song ! i 'm listning to it as i write this ! and also , little 6-year-olds can not properly appreciate it ! and , let 's face it , 'my immortal ' is not exactly a kiddie song.i mean , do you want your little 4-year-old boy listning to 'your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams , your voice it chased away all the sanity in me , these wounds wo n't seem to heal , this pain is just too real , there 's just too much that time can not erase ' ? please , stop buying this crap ! not only do they ruin the great songs of our generation , but they also put on some really innapropriate songs.i mean , come on ! go look up the lyrics to 'toxic ' ! that is definatly not a good song for little children . of corse , the only reason any child would like this is because their older sibling listens to it.then someone should sit them down and explain why this is not for them . die kidz bop
1	this album is hard ! e-40 always come sic wit it . if you do n't got it , ya betta git it . it reminds me of his ( my fav . ) '' i a major way '' album . sluppin ' from intro till outro . he is the bay area 's finnest . please belave it
1	this is a good compilation of afi 's songs over the 10+ years they 've been together . it 's easily worthy of 10 stars . this cd allows newcomers to listen to the progress leading up to sing the sorrow , and to get more intimate with the band . i hav n't purchased this album yet , because i already have all their albums , but plan on it . the new tracks are from the answer that , and very proud of ya era . they 've finally been released on cd . this is a cool little feature fo newcomers also . anyway , buy this album only if you hav n't heard any of afis music but want to give it a try
0	on the liner notes to one of the two blues albums ( i think it is shaker ) it is said that the original idea was just to perform some of these songs in a one night concert . that should have been as far as it went . to foist these songs on an unsuspecting public at 19 bucks a crack is highway robbery . if these are blues songs , then i am robert johnson 's illegitimate son . `` death letter '' is good , maybe even great , but can not compare to the original or to any of the covers i have previously heard . the rest is a waste of time . the cover art is excellent but hardly the reason you would be expected to buy the cd . these are my first 2 reviews by the way , but all these 5-star reviews for both cd 's finally got me motivated . go buy a muddy waters or lightning hopkins cd and save 10 bucks in the bargain
0	boo-wop ? haha ok , anyways i bought his through middle-piller distro . and it 's got a couple of o.k . songs on it . the problem is the singing and the overall production . this is definetely a home-recording on computer deal . the vocals are waaaaay weak . what exactly is a `` re-worked '' debut album ? ? ? i thought once an album was out it was done , set in stone ? apparently not , so mister monster gets to pull a blitzkid ( who changed their first album cover years after it came out ! ) and take the cheezy way out . a definete step up from bands like blitzkid , but still in the cellar of rock n roll . do yourself a favor and buy some good old deathrock from the golden years
0	whilst leo kottke plays guitar like a man with three hands and john fahey like a man with at least 11 or 12 fingers , robbie basho plays like a man with about eight thumbs . that this kind of tuneless twanging should be mentioned in the same breath as anything by kottke or fahey ( or peter lang ) is puzzling to say the least . but , credit where credit 's due : it 's not easy to make an acoustic guitar sound this unpleasant
0	why is dylan taking sole credit on an album featuring a fair percentage of other peoples song writing ? shame on you bob
1	being quite the fan of grace slick , jefferson airplane , and other 60s groups , i bought this album only having heard two songs on it -- '' daydream nightmare '' and `` outlaw blues '' . at first i was a little puzzled -- the great society sounded different than any band i 'd ever heard before . after listening to it about two more times , i realized this uniqueness was a good thing ! they sound a little rougher than your average 60s band , and they were -- grace , her first husband , and her brother-in-law assembled this band out of a few of their friends and it only was around for about a year . the great society definitely is n't a band for everyone , but if you love interesting-sounding music , want to hear some of the earlier forms of psychedelic rock , or are just curious about how grace slick sounded before the *smoother* recordings of jefferson airplane , this is the band for you ! a quick review of all the songs : sally go 'round the roses : a great way to open this cd . pay special attention to the instrumental break in the middle -- it 's amazing ! ( any time this group does an instrumental solo , it will be very good . ) did n't think so : in my opinion , one of the weaker songs on this album , but a fine song just the same . grimly forming : an overall fantastic song to listen to with intriguing lyrics and another great instrumental section . ( i love the tambourine -- it adds an interesting air to the song . ) somebody to love : yes , here it is -- the original version of the jefferson airplane hit , written by darby slick , grace 's brother-in-law . this has a much less *psychedelic* sound than the ja version , but they 're both equally as good . father bruce : this is a very catchy song written about lenny bruce as if he were a preacher . fun to sing along with . outlaw blues : this is a cover of a bob dylan song , i think . grace 's voice on this is incredible . often as i may : another fun song that 's almost as catchy as father bruce . arbitration : this song is mostly some great instrumentals but features some singing from david minor ( he did rhythm guitar , i believe . ) white rabbit : yup , another original version of a ja song ! this song 's about 6:20 because there are 4 minutes of great guitar/sax playing at the beginning . almost better than the ja version ! that 's how it is : a cheery song with fun words . you 'll definitely be singing this one aftewards . darkly smiling : this is another `` weak link '' on the cd . ( there are n't many , thankfully ! ) it does have some interesting lyrics , though . nature boy : grace 's singing/recorder playing make this song memorable . you ca n't cry : this is a fun rock song , with the usual great guitar playing from darby slick . daydream nightmare : this is one of the more *psychedelic* and dark songs on the album , with great bass and guitar playing and more of grace 's recorder . this is definitely not a song to skip over . everybody knows : also a fun rock song , and yes , another catchy one . born to be burned : this song is a little less exceptional , but it does have a good bass line , and some good guitar . father : a fantastic way to end the album ! this song is a nearly-seven minute long instrumental that builds up to an amazingly frantic crescendo . not a song that will keep you bored
0	ok , i 've listened to fat boy slim . that guy 's stuff is n't bad , by no means main stream , but worth while . but ... this norman cook - he 's horrible . it 's no wonder cook developed an alter ego . with the exception of a few easily recognisable tunes , i could n't believe this `` stuff '' had come from the same artist that produced praise you . renegade master is the type of track i 've come to know and respect ( that one is a keeper ) , and i have to give props for i left my wallet in el segundo . other than that , this album sounds like someone mixed songs from the first dozen records they found during their expedition to the flea market . if this is the sound you 're looking for , save a few bucks , check out your local yard sales . so as not to be too negative , i 'll say this ; the printing job on the cd itself is charming . the notion of making it look like a turntable was inspired
0	i hate it when rock stars form those g0d awful `` supergroups '' . ca n't people see that putting a whole bunch of different people from different bands together in one band is just a marketing scam and nothing more ? there 's no such thing as a good supergroup . the supergroup is the only kind of band that deliberately tries to $ uck . when damn yankees released their 1990 debut , every song on it was so incredibly generic , there was no hope for this band . the whole album seemed rushed and thrown together . they had nothing meaningful to say with these songs , it just seemed like they were pumping out filler and hoping somebody would be stupid enough to fall for their `` supergroup '' scam . the big , booming , arena rock choruses just ring hollow . i guess they 're trying to be catchy and have memorable hooks , but to me , it just sounds like a lot of filler . supergroups will always suck , because they diliberately try to sound bad ! thats right people ! supergroup members know that since they 're already popular , the album they 're putting out is guaranteed to be a big seller -- -- '' why bother trying to come up with good songs ? we 're already popular , so people will buy it no matter how bad it is ! lets just put out filler . '' supergroups are a total farce , its just easy money for the people involved , and nothing more . if you buy any album by any supergroup , than you my friend , are a sucker ! if you want to hear shaw or blades at their best , just keep listening to any styx or night ranger album , and avoid anything by damn yankees , or any other supergroup
0	once again , the geniuses at universal have failed to give fans a decent collection ! although the single disc very best of released in 2005 provided a fine and simplistic overview of robert palmer 's career , it omitted a few `` must have '' songs in favour of live material ( making for a 90 % ok collection ) . earlier anthologies also suffered invariably from `` redo '' syndrome : the artist redoing a vocal track here , a drum mix there , re-recording entire songs elsewhere . this collection 's no different . in fact , there are many `` remixed '' and `` redone '' and `` alternate vocal '' mixes present ( something the very best of album avoided altogether , much to its credit ) . here , insult is further added to injury with poor song sequencing . indeed , the classic and sequenced `` sailing shoes/hey julia/sneaking sally through the alley '' trilogy that marked the beginning of palmer 's breakthrough album is present , but the songs have been scattered apart from one another . thereby pondering the question : what were they thinking ? why was this done in this manner ? what do fans really want ? a 2 disc set that features the original material ( remastered , yes , but not remixed in any way , shape or form ) and a proper chronological sequence . done in this manner , such a set would properly honour one of popdom 's most memorable and talented individuals . what gold has done showed that compilers went through a rock encyclopedia , took the right batch of songs , but mish-mashed them in a half-cobbled manner . this collection does no one any favours . stick to very best of until another bright light at universal tries their hand at compiling a decent collection . that said , the way the music biz is these days , do n't count on it .
0	my two parakeets seem to enjoy this cd a bit , but if you want a cd for relaxing listening , be prepared to be irritated . i tried to go to sleep listening to it one night . i had to turn it off because it just got on my nerves ... ..i kept thinking it was stuck ... .like a record stuck in a grrove . it sometimes seems they recorded it by just hitting the `` repeat '' button on a couple of bird sounds . i think i could have done that . i 'm just glad it did n't cost a lot , but now i can see why . sorry for such a bad review , but i just had to tell anyone planning on buying it . i now just play it for my birds when i am not in the room
1	eddie 's first all-studio recording , and the album that got me hooked . i must say that even though they are uncomparably fantastic live , this album demonstrates the range and diversity of eddie from ohio . `` oh my brother '' is a particular favorite with julie murphy wells displaying her amazing range and beautiful voice , and robbie schaffer 's talent for emoting the absolute best of a heartwrenching situation . if this song does n't touch your heart , you have no appreciation for music . a particular plus on this album is a beautiful violin solo of `` yerushalyim shel zahav '' by guest musician pete wilson on `` jerusalem , '' another song by robbie , this time also performed by him . as always , the amazing prowess of this group is displayed magnificently
1	sometimes i like to look up and see what i can find on some of my favorite bands from the 70 's and starz being one of them . i was lucky enough to see the band play a few times around 77 and 78 . another band that took time for their fans ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i read through the many reviews of posted here on amazon and not sure if there is much that i can add , also great to see that there were so many out there that enjoyed the band and their music . i would recommend reading about each of the starz cd 's and listening to the sound files if available and deciding for yourself ... ... .. i remember i liked this cd so much and the logo as well , i even hand- made a stencil and made my own starz shirt , i think i used some of that gold `` glue on glitter '' in a tube and had one of the first starz shirts , before the band even had any if i remember right . lots of good songs on this cd , pull the plug being one of my favorites both on the lp/cd and live . all good rock songs from a band that deserved a lot more ... ... ... i could go on trying to describe the music ... ... ... . too bad there are no sound files for this cd ... ... . so you may just have to order it and take a chance . the remaining members have played a few shows during the past year or so and guitar player richie ranno continues to be active in the music business , you may even want to go over to starzcentral to get updated and see what richie and the band are up to . singer michael lee smith also had a brother that had his own band and later ventured into hollywood ... ... . but this is about starz ! ! ! ... so ... . i highly recommend checking out the cd 's and starzcentral . not to be confused with the movie channel or another band from europe that is using the name recently
1	this remasted disc is nice with the bonus tracks and spiffed up sound , but the only way top hear aoxomoxoa is to find a original w7 ( warner brothers-seven arts ) green label vinyl pressing . the cd features the 1971 remix ( like the 1989 cd ) in which 1/3 of the backing has been stripped like constanten 's prepared backrounds on `` what 's become of the baby '' , the extra drums and barbershop vocal on `` doin that rag '' . st stephen lost something in the remix as well . anthem was remixed as well in 1972 but the band was wise to issue the 1968 mix on cd . no hidden goodies on this disc , but the bonus tracks are great
1	lead singer and co-founder david gates was recently inducted into the songwriters hall of fame . this album is one prime example of why . david has consistently provided beautiful melodies with easy , sensitive lyrics . his last album was a country album called `` love is always seventeen , '' which was a genre-crossing mix of pop and country , co-produced and performed with billy dean . but back to this gem . `` guitar man , '' and `` aubrey '' were the big hits off of this album , and they still stand the test of time . `` tecolote '' is one of their most unusual departures , and still makes me laugh , while enjoying its musicality and orignality . `` did n't even know her name '' is a poignant lost love song ; `` welcome to the music '' is one of those opening songs bands sometimes did to orient their fans to what to expect . even larry knechtel gets in on the vocals with the intriguing `` picture in my mind . '' it 's a great album -- -in fact , there 's not a bad `` bread '' album out there ! enjoy , and relive those magical moments of the glorious seventies
0	in the classic and disturbing 1972 movie deliverance , lewis ( burt reynolds ) gives this ominous warning to ed ( jon voigt ) : `` machines are going to fail . systems are going to fail . then ... survival . '' what , i wonder , will richard d. james ( a.k.a . aphex twin , a.k.a . afx ) do when the machines fail ? it 's been nearly five years since his underappreciated album drukqs , where we got a tantalizing possible answer to this question : the plaintive , lovely , satie-esque acoustic keyboard nocturnes intermingled among the abstract , frantic electronic soundscapes throughout its sprawling duration . [ another intriguing solution was proposed on the album acoustica : alarm will sound performs aphex twin ... ] chosen lords , rdj 's first proper cd release since then , is actually a collection of various tracks from his `` analord series '' of overpriced , elaborately packaged 12-inch vinyl singles that he 's been cranking out over the last year or so . those who were put off by the excesses and overt eccentricity of drukqs may hail these cryptically titled , drum-machine laden compositions as a `` return to greatness . '' indeed , afx is certainly reviving a more compact , accessible ( for him ) , and straightforward style here , with comparatively regular ( though not quite danceable ) rhythms and those comforting underlying simple synthesizer melodies . i have to say , though , that there 's a disappointing and somewhat melancholy sense here of a great musical mind spinning its wheels . by returning to such familiar ground he seems to be setting up systems and letting them run their course in an almost cynical way , without any of the maniacal glee that was once part of his singular musical personality on unforgettable releases like come to daddy , windowlicker , the richard d. james album , and , yes -- drukqs . notably lacking are the voices that once regularly appeared in his productions -- true , they were usually rather unsettling , distorted , and manipulated voices , but at least they added some welcome humanity . also missing are those rare but beautiful moments of repose ( ballads ? ) such as `` flim , '' `` nannou '' and the striking piano interludes on drukqs . in the end , chosen lords , while an undeniably interesting and expertly produced collection of electronic music , is nonetheless a sterile , static , joyless affair . if it inspires any emotion at all , it will probably be pity and sadness as you listen to a possible musical genius coasting along without exploring any new directions for the first time in his otherwise remarkable career . yes , i 'm afraid the machines have failed richard d. james , and i sincerely hope he can survive in this cold and remote musical wilderness of his own creation..
0	before you all dismiss me as an obsessive , close-minded thrash fanatic ; i thoroughly enjoyed `` chaos ad , '' which was a sep ' album with the perfect balance of experimentation and death metal . i like the idea of experimenting with tribal sounds , but with those sounds , max decided to throw in downtuned guitars , not doing guitar solos , excessive profanity , lame `` i hate this i hate that '' lyrics , and guest musicians . the only decent songs on here are `` roots bloody roots '' and `` dictators*** ; '' everything else is awful . this is n't sepultura , this is soulfly . i 'm glad max left because if he stayed in the band , sep ' would have degenerated into a nu-metal band . for good sepultura albums , get these instead ( starting with the best ) : schizophrenia morbid visions/bestial devastation beneath the remains arise chaos ad dante xxi nation roorback ps , you max fanatics need to cut derik green some slack , he 's keeping sep ' alive while max is making an arse of himself with soulfly
1	the relaxation set is just that , pure relaxation . i love the active relaxation cd . i can read or work and i am real calm , on an even keel , feeling like when you go to sleep at night , not quite asleep and not quite awake . i also enjoy the water and the piano playing . highly recommended
0	ok , so the song playing when brian goes and we see mia for the first time is a song called `` deep enough ( urban remix ) '' by live . i have the other songs written down , including the one played between the two buildings , so i will find them and tell you . if you all want only the songs that were actually in the movie , rent the dvd , and take about ten minutes to watch the credits and write down the song names and artists . that 's how i have only the songs that are in the movie
0	i ca n't believe rubbish like this goes platinum . rap today with a few exceptions is a joke . people like chingy , nelly , ludacris , ja rule , lil jon and any other idiot with lil in their name are ruining rap and making it look like a joke . what is really getting me angry is how so many people do n't give any respect to real rap legends like tupac and biggie , and give tons of respect to all these clowns . people are thinking this is the sort of stuff rap fans listen to . all these people talk about is money , bling bling and sex . rap used to be about the streets now its just all i 've got so much money and stuff . if you want a real rap cd then get one of the following . nwa - straight outta compton ice cube - amerikka 's most wanted dr dre - the chronic snoop doggy dogg - doggystyle nas - illmatic tha dogg pound - dogg food tupac - me against the world tupac - all eyez on me tupac - greatest hits 50 cent - power of the dollar biggie - life after death you get the picture
1	i agree with most of the reviewers that this band was very underated.great singing electric and acoustic guitar playing and great songs.why were songs like natures way and i got a line not huge hits ? i got a line made the top 40 i think.natures way was a great acoustic ballad.also nothing to hide has a nice acoustic/electric section.also mister skin could of been a hit catchy.this band was better than a lot of the crap that came out in the late 1960 's all the bad hippie bands of that era.as for the whole album i think it would get five stars if it had some live tracks as bonus cuts , like a live i got a line or natures way live hearing that live would of been fun . i heard samples on a live spirit cd.a great unknown band that everyone should give a listen to and to remember what real musicians and songs were about in the old days
0	this cd is not at all what it appears to be . they got other people singing and playing the music , so it 's not what you 're probably looking for . terrible misrespresentation . i was so disappointed ! thank goodness i used my other party cd 's or my guests would have left ... ... and i would have held the door open ... ..not blamed them for leaving !
0	i ca n't believe the other people giving this high marks . i love the wheel , but darn if this is n't just terrible . there is n't even a single on it ; i ca n't believe the studio released it . thank god i got a promotional copy and did n't have to go buy it in the store . the catherine wheel needs to get back together -- quick
1	wonderful cd the music brings back a lot of childhood memories ! a must have for those who are looking for a cd that includes neil diamond 's top hits .
0	with 2 cds of endless repeated chords , they do n't have much to say
1	this album is the shyit , cougnut and c-fresh deliver , the only problem you might have with this album is figuring out which one is cougnut and which one is c-fresh , but as you listen you will tell differences . `` back in the days '' is real old album , so audio can be bad for a couple of the tracks but there isnt a weak track on this album . the beats do n't get too bass heavy untill `` hillary '' after that song the next 4 tracks or so are very bass heavy , but the flows are tops . these guys are the definition of gangsta , and is a must for anybody who likes gangsta rap . all guests are sick to , dre dog , cellski , chewy , r.b.l,2.2 and mack and al kapone . definetly a classic
1	after watching the movie walk the line , i wanted to hear more of johnny cash . all these years ( 35 of them ) i always thought he was just a slow folk singer . his music is non-stop foot tapping soul grabbing stuff . he toured with elvis presely and jerry lee lewis . he inspired musicians like bob dylan . i am so glad i bought this cd . it 's the best purchase i made all year .
1	i love this album but the other review from anonymous is wrong . this cd is not remastered . i baught this cd because of that review and got burned . the cd even says right on it aad . in other words analog recording/analog master/digital playback . i will say this much though , the transfer is better than mca 's version which i own . however , if you want a remastered version of the song monster look to the `` all time greatest hits/original recording remasterd '' cd from mca . it also has move over from this cd , i love this cd and want it remastered . if you got ta have this album ( i do ) than this version sounds better than the mca version
0	all in all , i was really dissapointed ; i really enjoyed the king geedorah album . i thought the king geedorah album boasted stellar , thematic , production , tolerable skits , and street-wise but deep lyrical content . doom is on the boards for about 1/3 of the tracks on 'escape ... ' all have the stereotypical doom sound , with the only standout being '1,2 ... 1,2 . ' the x-ray produced tracks are minimal , but generally sound stiff , lacking much of a groove - thin synth lines , few sampled melodies . i did like 'warning ( kong ) , ' which has a nice , minimal , dark groove . the lyrical flows have a classic new york sound , pretty good . lyrical content is pretty bad , unless you enjoy repetitious rhymes about smoking weed and women riding my d $ * .
1	ummm if you buy it you will know i borrowed it from a friend and he never got it back ... so i bought him another
0	i should have reviewed this along with fm . both were double record hit soundtracks . both represented youth . both are excellent time capsules of what radio was playing . one was a bad movie with a great soundtrack and the other was a classic movie with a terrible soundtrack . this is the terrible soundtrack . when the best songs are by billy squier and sammy hagar you know you 're in trouble . jackson browne , joe walsh , don henley are each awful . so were the go-go 's . not surprisingly don felder and jimmy buffet both sucked . i almost fell asleep in route 128 traffic when graham nash played . the band that called themselves poco ca n't be the same poco i grew up with . there were some listenable tracks by timothy b. schmit , louise goffin and stevie nicks but then there 's quarterflash . however , amongst all this crap was a gem ... the very last song is goodbye goodbye by oingo boingo . this song rocks and danny elfman sounds crazed . unavailable anywhere else which saves this from the trash
0	as a contemporary of joan baez ( age-wise ) , i loved her early music and the power of her incredible voice . i even empathize with much of her politics , but unfortunately it 's time she rested on her laurels . her voice on this cd is quite far removed from what she was once capable of , and in fact i would have to say that there is no comparison between her vocal ability on bowery songs , and her earlier quality . like some professional athletes , she seems to not know when to quit ...
0	as much as i like most of the songs on this cd ... it 's just too short . also the production is lousy . the recording quality sounds awful in places . hopefully , the updated compilations are better . this one is not worth the money ! ! !
1	this is a great cd ! each track fades up to full volume at the start and fades down to silence at the end . this makes it nice to just play the entire cd or to loop one track since there are no sharp changes from one noise to another . so far the car and washing machine tracks seem to be our baby 's favorites . when she outgrows the need for this white noise cd , we 'll transition her to lullaby or classical music . for now though , this cd helps us keep her on a schedule and well rested by helping keep her relaxed and usually asleep during her nap times . as a bonus , the waves and rain on the roof tracks are soothing for grown-ups needing to drown out noise while they sleep
0	i bought this soundtrack in 1984 when the movie adaptation of george orwell 's book came out , simply because it was attached to the movie . i 'll try not to use any non-family words here , but this soundtrack sucks . muldowney 's original score is available on cd , and simply imagining it used as intended adds a whole new dimension to the movie . as far as this soundtrack goes , though ; skip it
0	john coltrane was villified most of his creative life for playing at the edge of a world he was helping to redefine . wynton and the lcjo are in effect the death of creative musicians like coltrane , or most of the truly creative jazz scene for that matter . wynton is establishing himself as `` the face of jazz '' . a market oriented phenomenon which freezes some of the elements making jazz without ever capturing the true essence of the music . by telling us ( and make no mistake , these guys do ... ) : `` this is what jazz is '' and trying to re-appropriate themselves the music of jazz giants such as john coltrane who , if he were alive , would not be given the time of day by these folks , wynton and his posses are raping what is true and beautiful in this music . the recording , since i must talk about it , features a set of crafty yet discomboluted arrangements merely mimicking what coltrane was , mostly empty of content , setting in motions soloists who sound more like `` jazz puppets '' than anything remotely close to what coltrane was striving for ( notable exception : ted nash ! ) . you do not need this record . wynton and the lcjo does not need your money ; spend it on musicians who put their life and their art on the edge , the way coltrane did
1	this album was so good to hear when it came out . i like every song on here but my favorites are `` still dre '' , '' the watcher '' , '' xxplosive '' , '' what 's the difference '' and `` forget about dre . those are my favorites but there a lot of other songs that people will like . recommend this album highly to rap fans . buy this album you have nothing to loose because its dre one of the best producers in the game right now so click on add to cart and be happy you hearing this classic
0	nelly could make the wort rapper sound like a lyricyst , and how dare him to diss krs-one , he just said the truth and he really did not diss him on number 1 , he just added to why he sucks . lets face it , all his songs are basically dumb and and really don , t have much texture involved . and how funny is it that his friends really have no skill and they are all over this album it is just laughable . if you buy this album , you throw away good money . unless you like bubblegum rap . this is more for a teen white girl who wants to be cool , but lets face it , its played out
1	you have not heard his voice until to have heard andras schiff play the well tempered clavie
1	stiff upper lip is a good ac/dc album , it 's not a great ac/dc album . it kills me when people say that ac/dc have sounded the same since 1973 on every album they have done . nothing could be further from the truth . i have always thought that each ac/dc album has a sound and a feel and a story in it 's own and that a track off each album would be totally out of place on another album . for instance , can you image shake a leg on stiff upper lip ? or ballbreaker on back in black ? it does n't work . stiff upper lip has its own kind of rough , bluesy feel to it . brian 's voice sounds different , the tones and the guitars sound different . it 's good but not great . the standouts ... 1 . stiff upper lip- pretty rocking song . has a good attitude . it 's fun . 2 . hold me back and ca n't stand still . very odd rolling songs . they sound a lot alike . again , these songs could never have been on back in black . i have heard that brian sang ca n't stand still in one take , that 's why they all clap at the end . i do n't know if that 's true , but it 's an interesting song . 3 . satellite blues- this one is an instant classic . i love this song . this song could have been done back in the days of back in black and if it were on that album i think it would be as popular as you shook me all night long . everything else is ho hum . not good , not bad . better than most bands out there . i am really hoping ac/dc put out a killer album with their new release , whenever that is . i hope they do n't turn into the new g and suffer from the chinese democracy syndrome
0	it seems that even the best bands have only a finite number of great melodies in them , and the flower kings exhausted theirs in their first four cds . here we have yet another double-helping of their ageless wisdom , strewn across two cds to our fiduciary detriment . though not as crass and offensive as stolt 's `` wall street voodoo '' or bodin 's `` i am '' , this is nevertheless lyrically naive to the level of silliness . there are a few good instrumental passages mixed in this release , but not enough to justify its purchase . stolt said in a recent interview something to the effect that `` ... peace love never go out of fashion ... '' well , neither does informed maturity , and you wo n't find any of that in this group 's recent output . just more utopian preaching and good vs. evil typecasting . their liner notes advocate sending money to greenpeace and amnesty international , but i would counter that any american would be better investing their extra cash at st. jude 's children 's hospital . i 'm going to sell my copy of `` paradox hotel '' , and probably several more flower kings cds , to do just that . there are some sick children out there who need our support and encouragement far more than these would-be hippies
1	this cd is dave bromberg 's best effort . playing solo allows his guitar playing capabilities to be clearly demonstrated .

0	garbage metal - music for the american mainstream to feed on . i saw them open for slayer about 4-5 years back , and they had about 5 guys on stage doing nothing except jumping up and down . how pathetic ! pick up some real metal ... . like old kreator .
1	goth meets cabaret , or rather gothic music influenced by cabaret . thats the best way to describe this wonderful little release by projekt . the eleven tracks here provide an introduction to the `` dark cabaret '' scene , and do so quite well . the first song , coin-operated boy by the dresden dolls , is a great start , and the cd continues onward to devious evil night together by jill tracy ( which sets up a wonderful film noir mood ) and on to the darker , electronic dance number cabaret fortune teller by audra , to a remix of knock three times on my coffin by projekt veterans black tape for a blue girl . along the way numerous other bands are covered . sam rosenthal 's side project revue noir makes their debut on this cd , with husky feminine vocals provided by nicki jaine , who also has a solo song ( pretty faces ) on the cd as well . personally , i loved revue noir and find nicki jaine 's voice to be quite alluring , but i also know some btfabg fans who dislike her vocals so you 've been warned . but all in all , i think anyone with a task for the dark should check out this cd . at the very least , its a cheap and decent introduction to a whole new style , and thats always a good thing
0	my wife got this cd for me because i like the music from the movie cast away . she saw the words cast away in large and prominent print . she saw the picture of tom hanks , very large . she assumed it was the soundtrack for the movie and not just the 10th track of 10 on the cd . in hindsight she should have read the entire panel on the cd . i guess the producers of this cd did n't think the rest of the music could stand on its own and so they deceptively packaged it this way figuring most people would n't waste time returning it . if you had it listed in the rate column , i would give it a negative rating instead of just the one star
0	i basically love anything mr. carter does , but this one has alot of great lyrics ( as usual ) . i 'm so glad he 's coming out of retirement . any fan of jay-z will enjoy this cd
1	this is just a great cd . whenever i need to restore inner harmony after work , or dealing with any upsetting situation , this is the one i go to . instantly i am transported to the calm , soothing setting of a traditional japanese house and garden . it is fantastic for meditation , too . let all the nonessentials of life slip away while you listen to this beautiful recording
1	i have loved the swans since my danceteria days in early 80s new york . but its a fitful , frustrating love . you get the sense from 'incandesent ' that the swans forgot to stop partying . that they never took the time to put together more than a handful of songs . oh , but what songs they were . this collection is for completists and aging post-punker ( like myself ) who wished they 'd shared a pint with the boys back when simply getting stoned was a subversive act . its a nice collection of beautiful , quirky oddities here . but a few gems are missing `` holy holy '' , `` 1982 '' , `` world of milk and blood '' come to mind . maybe on an 'ashes ' reissue . in the meantime , scoop this up . simpson company deserve the attention . if you really care about the band , buy it directly from their label , renascent . that way the company ( and the band ) can make a few pennies . maybe enough to mine the crates for a second hits collection .
1	i was looking for some music i could play in the car or around the house with my 19-month-old son and came across this one -- the exact same `` album '' that i had when i was his age ! i 'm so glad they redid it ! one of my fondest memories
1	although this sports new remastering , unless you have either the golden hits cd available here at amazon and your local cd shop , the now out of print golden celebration boxed set or the 2 volume `` patti page collection '' series ( volume 2 is also out of print ) , this is unnecessary as it duplicates every track on golden hits except for let me go lover instead of with my eyes wide open i 'm dreaming and the songs are arranged in a different order . fans are better off looking for the 2 previous out of print collections with let me go lover to obtain this track and for the rest of this stuff , either buy golden hits , the boxed set and the 2 volume patti page collection series , and btw , vol . 1 is still in print so you can order it right here at amazon
0	how can he be such an enormous talent when all he does is copy off of other people ? sorry i just cant see it . i dont think he does justice to nolan porter 's `` if i could only be sure '' on the first track at all : if you want to hear some great music listen to the original ! ! !
0	yeah , i am a big fan of moby , and accidentally buying the cd that almost ended his career does n't shake that , if you want some good moby might i suggest 18 or play , this has some quiet more ambient tracks which show some promise , but fail to build up to anything , everything else is moby screaming in a traditional punk style , which were almost humorous , except , not [ this much money ] humorous , i am not a fan of this cd , i know he was starting out in a punk band , but his other stuff is much bette
1	some musicians , like fine chefs , make it look so easy . david grisman is one of them . on the cd , `` i 'm beginning to see the light , '' the prolific mandolinist extraordinaire is joined by scottish guitar virtuoso martin taylor and veteran grisman quintet members jim kerwin and george marsh ( on bass and drums/percussion , respectively ) for one hot little album . while the song list is comprised of many well-loved standards , such as `` autumn leaves , '' `` makin ' whoopee , '' `` lover man , '' and `` cheek to cheek , '' the taylor/grisman quartet seems to have so much fun preparing its stew and adds enough incredible seasonings to the pot to make emeril shout , `` bam ! '' as don stierberg , who penned the liner notes , says : `` music need not be trendy to be great . '' i wholeheartedly agree . ( c.a . carlino
1	if you do n't love this cd ( and many people wo n't ) , then you must have a very different taste in music then me . yes , it 's different . yes , it 's offensive . yes , it 's incredibly powerful . mutiny in heaven is insanity on a disc , six strings that drew the blood is awesome , as is everything on this disc . simply brilliant , and best disc to start a birthday party obsession with
1	while i am not a big fan of john mclaughlin or mahvishnu orchestra - i can not deny that they really had something with this album.. it is something new - not just an extension of miles davis - they were breaking new territory ... there is a cohesiveness amongst the band members - of course abounding with improvisational talent - this is fushion but first of all it is music
1	if you like the beach boys and appreciate the technical quality behind telarc recordings , then this disc is a must have in your collection . first , papa doo run run does an excellent job covering beach boys tunes to the point where some people ca n't tell the difference , but you can still hear the uniqueness they bring to it . second , you 'll feel like your hearing parts of the music you 've never heard before because there is so much more foundation and clarity to the recording . you can hear each instrument clearly . the beginning of `` i get around '' is almost explosive , they way the original recording should have been . telarc and papa doo run run have made a special album here . when i feel like listening to the beach boys , i usually grab this cd first
1	though i own alot of paul desmond recordings , this one as been in the cd changer for weeks now . there 's great , gentle interplay with jim hall , and a total sound that is most enjoyable . warm and round notes make this perfect evening music which i have found pleases most everyone
0	i am a cellist of 15 years on the breakthrough of becoming a renowed cellist . this cellist tone is so powerfull and clear.she tells a story this is so clear to understand because the music speaks . alisa should watch the slurs from the f to b and be more gracefull . the apres un reve was ok i guess . she really should of tooken more time . like floating on a dream cloud . when i play this piece i take the music from the begining as a fuzzy dream and play the pitch so the music tells a story and becomes more clear every measure . the elgar is somenthing she might not want to touch because no one plays it better than du pre
0	i love love tegan and sara and when i found out this was one of their favorite cds i have to admit ... .i think i was devastated . i just saw pretty girls make graves last night and they really could not have sounded worse.not just not enjoyable ... unbelieveably horrible . i think you should take your money and spend it on a cd that actually sounds like good music . do n't make your ears go through this much pain
1	quite different from his later big-band recordings . some of the songs that you may find on wes ' 'best of ' collections sound too much like elevator music . not so with this debut album . a drummer , a organist , and a guitar player ; no horn section . stripped down in the sence of band size but very deep and articulate playing . he shows of his trade mark octave playing , his chord solos ( played over the organs rythm chords none the less ) , and flashy runs across the fret board when needed . a good cd to start with for the guitarist who wants to play jazz .
0	many albums , including this one , have the problem that all the songs pretty much sound the same ; but this also has the troublesome problem of music that is too easy on the ears and that never gets very exciting - except for the first two tracks . the use of many poetry elements in their lyrics ca n't save the blandness of the music . `` what about everything '' and `` life less ordinary '' are good songs . the rest pretty much sound the same and will put you to sleep .
1	i 'll have to accept that even tough i 'm not a great fan of this band they have impressed me with this new release , the lyrics are in some cases very deep and in songs like evil angel they can touch you right there . for me the band has progressed a lot and you can tell that in this album , it 's very melodic and more mature . also the acoustic version of `` the diary of jane '' is amazing . i personally recommend the songs `` breath '' , `` evil angel '' and my favorite `` dance with the devil ''
0	if you like early priest , buy genocide . it has both rocka rolla and sad wings of destiny in their entirety ( the only thing it does not have is the original album artwork ) . not leaving out important tracks like the ripper , for pete 's sake ! ! ! how could you leave out the ripper ? and what about island of domination ? i feel sorry for anyone that bought this that is unfamiliar with priest . they got jipped and did n't even know it . these are my favorite albums by priest and i hate to see them butchered like this ... and what about the order of the songs ? why would they mess with that too ? do youself a favor and buy either genocide , or if you like to have the original artwork , buy rocka rolla and sad wings of destiny seperately
1	i got the pleasure of seeing albert open for bb king . unfortunately for bb king , because once albert started playing his flying v , with blues power , he demoralized anybody that came after him . he had the entire universal amphitheater standing . and stayed standing for most of his show . blues power is one of his best . get , listen , and then really listen . because you can feel your skin crawl with extacy from those notes..
1	with his snarling , gritty guitar tones , swampy grooves , and scratchy vocals , c.c . adcock makes butt-shakin ' music that blends rockabilly , old-school memphis r , new orleans funk , cajun dancehall tunes , and juke-joint blues . he 's young , but no poseur : having paid dues with bo diddley and buckwheat zydeco , adcock knows rootsy textures like the back of his hand . but despite the tremolo guitar and slapped upright bass , this is n't a retro-sounding record . adcock and his various producers bring a hip sonic edge to the music that keeps the moods fresh and the vibe ominous . doyle bramhall joins adcock on two songs , and together they raise 6-string hell . boasting richly layered guitars and heaps of attitude , adcock 's music is soulful , somewhat twisted , and deeply satisfying

1	this is what music is all about , the emotion in a simple legato trumpet note , or the raspy , delicious vibrato of vocalist david sylvian ; it makes me melt and feel so good and pure . think if tweaker were to make jazz -- and really chill out -- this is what it would sound like . you 'll never hear a sweeter sounding clarinet , ever . there is everything one could want . possibly the perfect record . it 's jazzy and cinematic and the double bass throughout is enough to make anyone melt and feel the emotion of the music course through their soul . absolutely brilliant and definitely essential . one of my favorites from the year .
0	2nd time .
1	my son loves music and really likes dan zanes . we started with the videos on disney and the `` catch that train '' song really got us singing , so we ordered this cd . now my son sings along with it , dances and jumps around . dan zanes really is fun for the family
1	this is one of his best cd 's . you really have to listen to the words on the cd , he takes you to whole another level . he is one of the best r singers ever , just close your eyes and listen to the song `` maybe '' and think of that special place for you and your lady
0	generally on amazon.com , the average rating of an album does not accurately indicate its quality - that is , the albums are usually highly overrated . this is probably due to the voluntary nature of the reviews and the fact that the fans of an artist are far more likely to review their albums and give them high scores than a casual music listener giving them the score they deserve . as a result of this , generally , albums that have an average score of 4.5 - 5 stars are usually excellent albums . ones with a score of 4 are generally good and 3.5 indicates a pretty average album . average scores any lower than 3.5 stars generally indicate a pretty poor album . as i mentioned before , due to the high proportion of fans reviewing albums , the average score rarely falls below 3 stars . it takes a pretty horrendous album , like limp bizkit 's results may vary , to get a score of even 2.5 . in fact , i did n't even think that it was possible for an album to get less than 2.5 - that is , until i saw this pile of feces . now to put this average score of 2 into context - this means that the proportion of `` hataz '' reviewing this album is even more than the proportion of fans reviewing it . out of all the terrible albums i have viewed , i have never seen this happen before . not even to bands as terrible as limp bizkit or even an*l c*nt . this obviously indicates a decline in fan numbers and , hopefully , the end of chingy 's 15 minutes of fame
0	while the title cut with joe public was bumping most of this disc is so-so & amp ; formula driven.without teddy riley the grooves & amp ; vibe are n't as strong
1	feinstein is in love with the gershwins and that passion is never made clearer than in pure gershwin . michael 's love affair with ira 's lyrics , his reckless abandon to the light-hearted spirit of the familiar -- and lesser known -- phrases , more than makes up for the less polished vocal production in this early album . in fact , it is that very element that sells these songs as i 've never heard them elsewhere . michael pulls out all stops , embracing the less-than-lily-white additional verses of `` embraceable you '' , with the unbridled passion of a first time lover . his duet with rosie clooney arrouses my curiosity about the movie in which this unknown number made its debut . what a delightful approach michael demonstrates throughout ... . oh , to be that young and exuberant about life , love and music again
0	yo nu-mixx sux i hate when people make cd 's like this to make some money off of great artist like pac . this cd is disrespecting pac and nobody should get this if your a pac fan . they take great songs and make crappy beats . get this if you want to support pac haters or waste your money
0	i found a supposedly `` new remastered edition '' of sade 's `` diamond life '' on sale for less than 10 bucks . oops ! great mistake ! when i tried to return it , the cd store was already out of business , and the copy is one issued in the netherlands which is marked into the booklet as `` 2000 digital remastered version '' . the whole album has been re-recorded with new arrangements ! the digital sound is quite good , but the new arrangements made for 'smooth operator ' really sucks ! !
0	i remember really liking this album when it was first released , even though i could tell it was not in the same league as the real thing or angel dust . listening to the album now , i realise it is by far the worst fnm album since mike patton joined . the whole album feels very rushed , it has a sparse , raw sound , very different to angel dust 's polish . the music is generally very simple with many tracks sounding like b-sides and lacks the consistent melodiousness and sense of rhythm of their previous two classic albums . it was a shame to see guitarist jim martin depart . he had an unmistakable style and crunching guitar sound and was an integral part of fnm 's style and make up . however , being replaced ( for a short time anyway ) by trey spruance is no bad thing - anyone familiar with his work with mr bungle will know he is a genius with a guitar and his work here on king for a day is excellent , it 's just a shame that the material he has to work with is largely uninspired . how ironic then that on such a disappointing album , fnm produce one of their greatest ever tracks - the title track is pure genius , full of the care and effort , rhythm and melodiousness fnm were famous for . beginning with a great bass riff and acoustic strum , it is soon joined by a gentle female voice effect and simple minor piano scale and then brilliantly builds into a tour de force of percussion and guitar work before cleverly returning to the gentle acoustic sounds of the intro where it carefully takes 2 and a half minutes to wind down beautifully - this is fnm as you 'd expect them . another track that deserves special mention is cuckoo or caca , a great metal piece with excellent percussion and keyboards and crazy vocals . it 's scorching and funy and another reminder of the greatness fnm once held in abundance . it 's just a shame that these moments of inspiration are surrounded by so much surprising blandness ( caralho voador , take this bottle , the last to know ) and 2nd rate metal ( ugly in the morning , what a day , get out ) . star a.d. could have been vintage fnm but in the end falls flat , evidence starts off interestingly enough but soon gets boring and metal tracks like ricochet , the gentle art of making enemies and digging the grave are simple and sound like what most student bands are writing . however , the album does end on another note of vintage fnm - just a man is funny and catchy with patton having fun doing his tom jones impression and the inclusion of a gospel choir at the end is inspired - you find yourself not wanting it to end . patton 's vocals throughout the album are still amazing but should be accompanying much better material and you ca n't help but feel he was a little bored here - i think his heart always really lay with the far superior mr bungle , where he really shone and where his voice was absolutely perfect for the complex and avant garde material . i suppose it 's not surprising that king for a day is a largely empty affair , the departure of jim martin and the diminished presence of roddy bottum at rehearsals meant that fnm 's original chemistry and resources were sadly lacking and so were unable to achieve what they once had been able to . it 's really an album for faith no more fans , it 's certainly no classic despite some classic material and i feel it was the beginning of the end for fnm , they would improve with their next album , album of the year - but only marginally .
0	i own this set , as does my roomate , and we both hate it . it highlights bands like 'red lorry , yellow lorry ' that no one likes or listens to , and uses great classic bands like bauhaus ' worst song as the first track . it is the hollow , tin-y , embarrassingly hokey side of goth , and i am ashamed to even have it in my house
0	on an episode of seinfield that is probably overexposed enough as it is , the always wily and oh so goofy character of kramer is playing a game of risk and exclaims that the `` ukraine is weeeeak '' . this causes him to get a thorough scolding and a little bit of trouble . i think the same basic sentiments work with this new order release . it probably was n't worth the ungodly long eight year wait although it produced the excellent `` rock the shack '' and of course `` crystal '' , which i 'll get back to later . unlike kramer i feel i can make this statement safely as i 'm not dealing with a burly , alcohol swigging ukranian , but new order fans , which are n't the most intimidating bunch out there . keyboardist gillian gilbert is not here as she felt taking care of her kids is more important , which it is , maybe . this album features the guitar of billy corgan , the frontman of the seminal 90 's group soundgarden . too bad they could n't get billy to collaborate five years earlier because at this point he was already full blown crazy , and was n't writing very good material or really using his guitar , at all . new order also made the mistake of having corgan to backing vocals . now a synth is high pitched and shrill enough , but to top that off with a billy corgan squealing like a pig cherry is probably not the best choice . so ... someone like you is more or less unlistenable . it has some pretty terrible lyrics about how bernard does n't want to wash his car . now i can relate , i would n't want to wash my car in britain since it rains all the time and would probably be an altogether futile affair , but this topic does n't result in the most captivating and well-written material . new order occasionnally want to rawk out with guitars on this album , something they do n't do very often , just like van morrison . now i 'm not sure if i 've heard a van morrison song but i 've always figured it was a give that they rawk out with guitars . case in point of this `not so good of an idea rawking ' is rock the shack . rock the shack kind of sounds like new order 's take on someone commissioned to write an epic gilligan 's island rock song , pretty amazing huh ? '60 miles an hour ' , `primitive notion ' , and `close range ' all suffer from being a little too vanilla and a little too bland . new order have patches here where they sound like they might be suffering from the same middle-aged blandness that has crippled other 80 's artist like depeche mode , the cure , and tears for fears ( who 've actually always blown ) . however , they do succeed fully well on two songs here . there is `crystal ' , which is truly an excellent rock song and show new order can succeed with a harder guitar edge and is probably one of the two or three best songs of new order 's career from the 90 's and beyond . how this did n't get more airplay than it did is a mystery to me , because it has the alternative rock of today written all over it . the other is run wild which is really a great little slow song , in the vein of `as it is when it was . probably new order 's only full-fledged ballad it serves as a fitting acoustic , moving ending to an otherwise disappointing album . get ready is good beginning and end , just not end between . kind of like that movie twin peaks : fire walk with me
1	the sundays come out with a cd once a decade , thus putting me in constant cravings for new material . though camera obscura is very original and very much their own band , they satisfy the cravings that only harriet wheeler could touch . truly vast and intimate at the same time , and a voice that speaks to something very deep , sad and lovely inside you
0	i thought it would have nice , soft songs . but , it is riddled with annoying sound effects and strange instrumentation
0	after carefully researching as many rain recordings as possible on amazon and reading all reviews i had hoped i had made a good choice with this cd . unfortunately i discovered that not only is the recording looped about every 60 seconds but there is an unmistakable low frequency rumble that is very apparent listening though my 5.1 system and my bose tri-port headphones . as a recording engineer i recognize this to most likely be a truck or car passing by and passing the sound up through the microphone stands that were obviously not de-coupled from the ground . the bottom line is i hear this rumble each and everytime i start to relax and it renders the cd completely useless to me . the recording is otherwise a good one and the stereo image presented seems authentic . since nobody else has complained of this rumble , i will assume that it will only bother someone with a trained ear
1	growing up with classical rock and having enjoyed rock music by rod stewart , i did n't think i 'd like this cd . one evening i was having dinner at a friend 's home and they had this one playing . it was beautiful . being a little older now ( in my early 40 's ) , i enjoy more mellow music than the head banging variety that is heard now . this cd of rod 's was nostalgic , romantic and extremely easy to listen to .
1	... and if you 're fortunate enough to find it , i recommend buying the version with the bonus dvd , which chronicles the making of yellow brick road . when i bought it , it cost the same as the 2 sacd set without the dvd , so it was still a great deal . my only complaint -- and it 's really minor -- is that it would have been nice if they could have fit the original album onto a single sacd . a second disc could have included the bonus tracks that are included in this package , plus any extra -- maybe even audio-only interviews -- still remaining in the vaults . no matter . the important thing , if you are able , is to make sure you have an sacd-compatible player ( like the pioneer dv-563a , or one of the really expensive players if you 've got the cash and love audiophile formats in both your hardware and your cds ) . even if you do n't , the stereo cd layer still sounds truly excellent
0	neither the amazon review or any of the customer reviews recently submitted mention this fact . i have few classical and pop recordings in mono that do not impact the listening experience such as 'songs for swinging lovers ' - frank sinatra or beethoven 's opera fidelio - conductor otto klemperer ( testament label ) . the material on these recordings are so good that the listener completely ignores the fact that they are mono recordings . i did not hear anything outstanding on this cd to make me overlook the 'mono ' factor . is this some great jazz masterpiece , recorded live in carnegie hall by two giants of jazz ? i personally do n't think so . somehow this material remained in obscurity for all this time and somebody by accident discovered this gem - if you believe that then elvis is alive and the earth is exactly 6000 years old . with small jazz bands , i like to listen to the musicians communicate with each other within the context of a thesis . examples : 'sunday at the village vanguard - bill evans trio ' or 'new york reunion - mccoy tyner quartet ' . i wanted to but could not hear anything of this sort in this recording . this material is more likely to be understood only by the performers themselves and the real jazz aficionados . it may have been hasty but after one listen i decided to sell this cd and i have no regrets other than buying it in the first place .
1	only 2 words can describe this great cd and they are ( simply incerdible ) im only 17 but i know great oldschool when i hear it and this is fantastic musi
0	oh , this is pure adult garbage all right . i have never heard a more disguisting piece of music then this , then again the movie was garbage also
1	martina mcbride 's `` emotion '' album contains many pop country elements , but is still nonetheless a great album . here 's how i rate each song . ( out of a 5 star scale ) 1 ) do what you do- good song , but takes a little to get used to . ( 4 stars ) 2 ) anything 's better than feeling the blues- good songs , good lyrics . ( 4 stars ) 3 ) i love you- great song , martina 's most successful song on the country charts , spending 5 weeks in the top spot . ( 5 stars ) 4 ) make me believe- great song about whether one 's love is true or not ... . i love the lyric `` but it 's hard to start a fire without a spark ( 5 stars ) 5 ) love 's the only house- this song will draw a strong connection to your heart . the song is spectacular and speaks the truth ... love is truly the only house big enough for all the world 's pain . the video to this song is very touching as well . go martina ! ( 5 stars ) 6 ) there you are- a perfect wedding song ... she hold the `` are '' note for at least 12+ seconds near the end . ( 5 stars ) if you hear this song live , she holds the note 15 seconds ! ! ! ! ( so live this song will be 6 stars/5 stars ! ! ! ! ) 7 ) it 's my time- the first song that i ever heard martina perform live in the ama awards ... she rocked the house down with this song ... she also holds a 10 second note at this song . love that range of hers . ( 5 stars ) 8 ) i ai n't goin ' nowhere- i like this song and its message about being there for a significant other . ( 5 stars ) 9 ) anything and everything- the lyrics and martina 's gentle vocal performance on this song are perfection . ( 5 stars ) 10 ) from the ashes- another standout song on this album . she holds some high notes in this one too . ( 5 stars ) 11 ) goodbye- a solid performance , i llike how martina goes lower and softer in some parts of the song . ( 4 stars ) 12 ) this uncivil war- the best song on the album ! ! ! ! amazing ! ! ! ! written by gretchen , the writer of martina 's career hit `` indepedence day . '' a very emotional song , which defines the title of the album . the ending is a real treat as well . ( 6 stars ! ) this album is definitely worth purchasing ! ! ! it helps complete my collection of martina 's albums
0	as long as artists keep making albums with only one good song , people will keep getting them for free in internet . nestor keeps insisting in doing instrumental hip hop , pop , commercial , elevator music . if you like that kind of music , buy this cd , otherwise buy hubert laws , or dave valentin among others . if you want to listen to good nestor music , buy `` morning ride '' , `` dance of the phoenix '' , `` talk to me '' , `` mi alma latina '' or the charanga album `` mis canciones primeras '' . sorry nestor , i am a big fan of your music but you are wasting your talent doing this kind of stuff . when do you plan to make a good non commercial latin jazz album
1	her voice takes my breath away , i fell in love with her . i highly reccomend it
1	linkin park are still together and they are making their next album , it is due out eairly next year . mike just did this for fun . look into things a little more buddy before you start saying things . oh yeah , and if you like good hip-hop , you 'll like this album . give it a shot . you dont have to be a linkin park fan to enjoy this record , since its nothing like lp . peace
1	this album is the foudation of modern hip hop ... the format of the album the presence of rakim ... .his image everything was new territory when this album came out in 86 ' all hip hop lovers should have this album especially people down south
1	i ca n't believe the harshness of some of the comments on this album . not a lot of in between among the notices -- those that hate are mean and heartless . very hurtful . lousy counterpoint to her warmth . i do n't think they understand that she does n't have to lose control to be meaningful and touching . take her as an original instead of as a mimic . what do i hear ? i love her lush voice on this album and fred hersch 's brilliant piano accompaniment . bill frisell is very good , too . i love jazz pop as well as opera . ren ? e fleming can make it any of these genres . these songs are very much her own interpretation . they are 'deeper ' than what you 've heard before . even if i prefer nancy wilson or eva cassidy singing `` you 've changed , '' ren ? e fleming sings it warmly and beautifully , in her own style , and very touching , too . she 's not carried by full orchestration , mostly just fred and her . i was going to write that `` my one and only love '' was especially good , but as the cd kept playing , i must say that they are all especially good . enjoy
1	i do not own this cd , but i recently saw the doctor at a local jazz club and was blown away . he had a good sense of humor and was very worldly . he would ascend and spiral upwords untill every one in the club 's heart rate had spead up 100 notches ... and boom ... he was back to being relaxed old lonnie . at the break i met him , and got an autograph . he was very insightful musical and with spoken words.i would reccomend seeing him live , aswell as buying his album
0	ok i 'll make it short but sweat great music , singing sucks ... this guy is flat every song and he should go back to the honk tonk and get away from rock ... if you think i 'm lying listen close how can anyone listen to this voice , he ca n't hold a note and sounds like he has a mouth full of mush , he sucked at country and has no place in rock ... home boy go back to texas and get back to branded some cows cause you suck
0	this is the perfect cd for taking a nap to . it 's mostly full of slow pop and rock . if you 're a fan of this type of music , i recommend this cd , but if not , do n't buy it . there are only a few good tracks . all star , bad reputation , i 'm a believer , stay home . and i do n't enjoy buying a cd that only 1/3 of it is good . so , i would n't buy it , if i were you .
0	if you have children that are five years younger , this would be a good album to put in your child 's boom box or get it in cassette for their tape player . but if your children are six and up . your better off finding the real songs and burning them if you can find these songs . this album should be saved strictly for the poor folks who wnat music for their kids but can not afford it . this ablum would be number 1 if it were sold in rwanda , sudan or other third world nations since it could be sold for like dirt cheap . parents , if you buy this album , after your children turn 6 years old . pack this cd and other ki8dz bop cd 's and send them to africa . this is pop music for impoverished folks
1	having read some of the reviews here i just thought i should mention that for those who enjoy punk rock music rather than the sameness of most emo music these days they should definitely check out this band ! while the singer ( conor oberst ) does have that emo voice so familiar to many other bands , he utilises it well and his conviction can be heard throughout ( unlike a band like taking back sunday ) the music is uplifting without being soppy or sentimental , the lyrics are refreshingly different from most punk-politics band and do n't come across as just the singer throwing a badly worded hissy fit . if you want to feel sorry for youself go listen to bright eyes , if you want to do something about it listen to desaparecidos
1	this band reminds me of the thrill i first got when i listened to an atreyu album . it dies today rip off the former bands style , but they are still a very good band . in the over-crowded metalcore market of today , that is a rarity . my only complaint , is that the vocalist has a beautiful singing voice ( as heard on `` the radiance ) , but more often then not goes for the screams and growls that are associated with this type of music . still 5/5 material though . favorite songs : `` the radiance , '' `` freak gasoline fight , '' `` our disintigration , '' and : the caitliff choir : defeatism
1	a very proud and highly recommended production , it 's a real pitty this cd is not available , i still have this one as a precious thing , i hear it all the time as well as i want . nobody will forget jeff lynne as an excellent musician , ever
0	rob touches on so much with this cd . my favorite song is one that has n't got any airplay and , in my opinion , the public missed out a great hit ! `` streetcorner symphony '' is about people coming together . it 's what i call my happy song . each day as i go to work i play the song as loud as i can get it ! we , my daughters and i , saw him live and he also called it a happy song ! i ca n't wait for his live albulm to come out ! there are fast and slow songs on this cd and will be worth every penny you spend to buy it ! incredible voice and songwritting
1	its quite difficult to sum up the impact of this cd with few mere words . suffice to say , level 1 is a timeless classic , in fact , it was my entry pass into the realm of d-n-b . logical progressions level 1 is a must-have for all d-n-b heads & amp ; music lovers in general . demon 's theme , western , danny 's song & amp ; horizons remain some of my favorite songs in any genre . bukem 's level 1 displays his flawless production & amp ; track mastery which cascades the listener with the ideal mid-tempo balance between dance-floor adrenaline & amp ; ambient bliss
1	what has happened to the song `` lives in the balance '' on this set ? if you go to his website it sounds really great ! ! ! on this set it sounds awfull ! ! it sounds as if he was in a really big hurry to get the song over with . the packaging if you could call it that is really lame . foam dots for holders ? what do you do when those fall off ? i suppose you put the cd 's in jewel cases or else they will get really scratched up . not to mention it is missing some of his greatest work ! true you do get alot of songs for the money but , there should have been more time planning this set out before actually producing it . if you own an i-pod i suggest you go to apples i-tunes web page and import the great songs this set is missing as well as the others you really like off of this set and you will probably have spent the same amount of money if not less
0	i have not heard of or listened to , this cd series , but from the sound of it , its all bad interpretations of popular music . i just want to say that if you want your kids to listen to music and you want to steer clear of the bad stuff ... play classical music . play stuff without lyrics . play a show on tv where the characters sing . do anything but , buy a cd where people that are n't the original artists sing songs that were never intended to be for kids in the first place . censoring a song or cutting lyrics tends to ruin that song . there are just some songs that are n't good for kids even if you cut out all the bad words . think about this ... do you really want your kids coming up to you later in their life after hearing the real version of a song and asking you why the song they heard as a kid is so different from the one they just heard on the radio and then having to explain to them that the song they heard as a kid was a clean version of the song ? listen ... i 'm all for trying to keep your kids away from inappropriate stuff for as long as possible , but cds like this are not the way to go . all they do is make kids think that all music is going to sound just like the music on the cds and when they finally hear the real stuff , they 're gon na be asking questions . do them and yourself a favor and do n't buy these cds
0	forget the fact that despite the grumbling about today 's `` music '' too many people just swallow and digest the slop record companies throw at them , `` hollaback girl '' is the absolute dumbest `` song '' i 've ever had the displeasure to hear . there are two main parts to this travesty : 1 . where she says `` that 's my sh** '' no less than a million times , and 2 . she demonstrates that she 's hooked on phonics by being kind enough to spell bananas for the rest of us . if this is supposed to be rap , stefani failed miserably . if it 's supposed to be dance , again , she failed miserably . to be honest , i do n't know what the hell this is supposed to be because it sure is n't music . the fact that it was number one for so long proves that perhaps people do n't have any requirements for their ears . - donna di giacom
0	if you want the original recordings , do n't purchase any volume of television 's greatest hits . i 've had better luck recording the songs off of my tv with a cassette tape recorder and then dehissing them on my pc . these collections have sterile sounding fake stereo recordings of `` the beverly hillbillies '' and `` the munsters '' that just do n't sound right to me . if the original recordings do n't matter to you , then you may like this cd
1	joan . you do n't love me . because i 'm a guy . but i have loved you since 1976 . ok so i 'm an old man ( age 43 ) . so what . she 's just the best rock and roll female on the planet . i like the young ones like sahara hotnights and the donnas as well but they just do n't measure up to joan born to be bad jett . this album - like most of her other albums - consists of a mix of old and new songs . does n't mattar . i love it . and the video ... well it confirms what we have always known . not that it matters . the music matters
1	really nothing on this is bad . the best imho is rubyhorse , the brian jonestown massacre and the subways but a case could be made for any of the songs . the only problem is now i have 8 other cds i need to buy
0	it was awful ! the reproduction of the music was grainy , scratchy and virtually impossible to listen to
1	although each track is beautiful in it 's own way , it 's their sum that makes this such an incredible album in my mind . where felt mountain remained rather mellow and etheral thruought the entire album , black cherry offers more in the way of diverse melodies and tempo . the tracks seem to be placed specifically in a way that makes the album feel like a journey , and , personally , like a lay 's potato chip , not able to listen to just one ... .yeah , i need the whole thing..
0	i wo n't go into a long diatribe . suffice it to say that when i listened to this upon its release earlier this year , i was disappointed . i gave it a few more close listens and find that the musical quality is not great . this is more a photo of dylan as a free-spirit . there 's a point where baez messes up a song . ( i do n't have anything against baez . that being said , i do n't have much for her either . ) there 's joking and laughing , but really , i do n't need a double-disk of acoustic material that seems to be performed by someone who sounds like he 'd rather be in the audience than performing . you can almost sense why dylan went electric in this concert . the bootlegs prior to this are superior and i would suggest that if you are n't a die-hard dylan fan to stick with them . if you really like dylan 's acoustic work and not his electric stuff , you should be pleased with this double-disc . i love dylan , but not enough to enjoy this over and over again . i 'll go to disk one of the 4th bootleg for my acoustic fix
0	generally harmless , except for one very offensive song about siblings that hate each other and hate their parents . the song is probably funny to ultra-sophisticated , cynical adults . but the song is totally inappropriate for a four year old . i would n't bring this cd into your house
1	i wore out my tape of cypress . afoot is great , but cypress is amazing . i bought this while stationed in the army . there were n't too many `` new wave '' tapes available at the px , and i was n't going to listen to def leppard or bon jovi . so i bought cypress . one of those rare tapes that i bought 20 years ago and still listen to every few months ( the jam 's snap and setting sons , and the smith 's hatful of hollow are 3 other tapes i never tired of ) . get this cd . get it now ! it is great . thanks for reissuing it .
0	this soundtrack does not have all the songs in it from the movie . i was looking for two from the movie , and the soundtrack did not have them . like , a song by michelle branch that is in the movie is not in there . bo
0	to much guitar , drowns out all the other instruments . survivor was made famous by heavy keyboards and drums , not guitars . i was expecting another burning heart , is this love , high on you . no songs on this albums have that sound . the vocals by jamison are top notch , but none of the songs sound like the survivor i remember . survivor guitars were only there to complement the keyboards , bass and drums , not drive the whole song . i guess jim peterik was the man behind survivor all along . i give the cd 2 stars for fire makes steel , the rest are throw aways . ***recommended for die hards only*** i highly recommend 'when seconds count ' for anyone getting started with survivor
1	with all the recent praise heaped on smile , orange crate art still remains largely under-recognized and under-appreciated . sure , smile was supposed to be this grand copelandesque landscape of america , from plymouth rock to the grand cooley dam . but for my money brian and van dyke parks did it so much better with orange crate art . having written , what everyone unanimously agrees to be the most california of all anthems , fun fun fun , i get around and california girls , brian turns his attention to a california not of hot rods and surf , but of sun drenched valleys rich with citrus and vine . here wilson and parks celebrate and pay homage to the likes of jack london and john steinbeck . and if all this were not enough , we 're treated to my hobo heart , a latter day van dyke parks / michael hazelwood masterpiece . there 's also the lovely palm tree moon , a dreamy little ode to a moonlit beach , territory not unfamiliar to brian . and summer in monteray is so unabashedly nostalgic it would even make clint eastwood blush . if you have n't become familiar with this so very underated collection yet , you really ca n't call yourself a brian wilson / van dyke parks fan until you give this one a fair shot . you might even find yourself humming sail away or hold back time while in the shower . i know i did
1	this is lovely stuff . the other reviews say why much better than i can , but i just had to add to the adoration
0	i got this cd because i loved their radio hits `` bring me to life '' and `` my immortal . '' while those songs are beautiful , they are not representative of the rest of the album . although i tried and tried to get into this cd , the hard rock teen goth style just is n't my cup of tea , and the lyrics are too depressing . if you are a fan of bands such as linkin park or seether , you might enjoy this . however , if you only like `` my immortal '' and `` bring me to life '' because of amy 's powerful vocals , you 'd be better off listening to tori amos or sarah mclachlan .
0	this disc is bad ! ! ! right at the 2 '' mark the sound of the `` rock water '' is join by what sounds like a slow draining bathtub . this sound is more or less present throughout the entire hour . other discs of this type that i 've heard do n't do this
1	like i said i would , i finally got around to purchasing this cd . i especially like tracks 9-12 . cheap trick is solid as always . i have been a long time fan and enjoy all their releases . if i do have any criticism at all , it is the fact that some songs sound like recycled trick riffs . i guess it 's hard to create new stuff after 30+ years . anyway , there are some great tunes on this . buy it like i did !
1	i was looking for a cd that i could listen to all of the time . oh my god , i am breathless . i was brought to tears as they sang `` mama '' . my mother passed away in 2002 and i never got a chance to say thank you and this song said it all . all of il divo 's songs have touched me in a way that no one else could . thank you for touching my heart . i really recommend that you give this cd a chance . all of these other people on the board that gave it a low score , obviously need a hearing aid and a heart . blessing
1	his playing on this album reminds me of that of bill evans . i am glad to see on reading all the reviews that someone else had that exact thought . comparison to bill evans is the best compliment i know how to give
1	i have only recently become a country music fan . i was n't sure i would like faith hill , but this was the first cd of hers i purchased . from the very first song `` this kiss , '' i was instantly drawn into her music . what i love about her songs is that they are so real . `` you give me love '' is so real and so strong . it 's nice to hear a song that a woman sings about a man who is crying for a change . `` the secret of life '' has taken some getting used to . it is not my absolute favorite on the cd . `` me '' is the song that means the most to me since i have experienced trying to change for someone else in a relationship . and `` i love you '' is a heart-jerker for those who have loved someone from afar . she has a big voice , and she nails each song on this cd . give it a try
0	the most untalented producer in the business . honestly the only tracks that shine is all the ones with biggie and black rob 's only one hit . the rest of this is trash . especially those chickenheads total . and once again puff tryin to eat off biggie carcass . dont give this bum anymore money , just listen to biggies two gems and `` f '' the rest
1	once she has won your heart , you will want this collection to hear how she developed as a performer -- and came to be a great symbol of france in the 20th centur
0	i remember this album well ; you could hardly call it a 'barnstormer ' , as it was released well before `` under the bridge '' made them the bandwagon band of the year , but nothing could hide the fact that this was a band hellbent on proving the critics right -- they never had a good album . for every song worth listening to ( `` suck my kiss '' , `` give it away '' ) , there were at least four more songs that should have been discarded . this album was and remains a perfect example of why bands should n't feel obliged to slam 50 minutes of crap onto a slab of aluminum just because they can . on top of that , the vocals were pitched and pro-tooled beyond belief . some friends and i got a chance to see the band when they were supporting this album , and kiedis was so off-key , it was n't funny . they drowned their sound in reverb so to try and drown out his lousy vocals , but the damage was done . people were walking out in droves
1	this collection of italian cello sonatas by the great janos starker is one of the most delightful chamber albums i own . the world renowned cellist was joined on this 1966 recording by pianist stephen swedish on five of the selections , and by his frequent collaborator gyorgy sebok on the bach sonata in g minor , which was recorded in 1963 and added to this collection to increase its length ( it is a welcome addition musically too ) . the selections here range from famous composers like bach , boccherini and vivaldi , to the lesser known corelli , locatelli and valentini . for me , the common thread of this recording is the passionate performances of starker . whether it is the happy bounce of the vivaldi allegro , the sublime rendering of the boccherini adagio , or the precise interplay with sebok on the bach sonata , starker plays masterfully and his cello is captured in rich , full sound by the mercury living presence recording technique . this is an excellent purchase for all cello enthusiasts
0	the cd is great ! ! ! the legendary johnny cash comes thru loud and clear on this cd . however , it took amazon over 30 days to deliver this item and that was only after numerous emails to them . their attitude of `` just wait a few more days and email us again '' was both insulting and annoying . thank goodness this was n't a christmas gift for someone .
1	del the funky homosapien has been my favorite mc for years , and this album does n't dissapoint . the dvd is raw , and packs in lots of live footage , interviews , and is well produced . if you are a fan of del , you know you have to pick this up .
1	i love this soundtrack ! it stands alone as beautiful , haunting , alluring , and innocent -- just as griet herself was in the film . desplat perfectly captured the spirit of the story , enhanced and deepened a plot that was less than stellar . scarlett johanssen 's acting is superb , as well as essie davis and colin firth . the story , though , was a bit tired -- pretty housemaid/jealous wife/do-nothing husband . its portrayal of vermeer and his wife was a disservice to the real people , even though it is a fictionalized account . the two best tracks on this album are 'griet 's theme ' and 'colours in the clouds ' . while i 'm not keen on seeing the film again , this soundtrack is a treasure . it 's a real work of art , second only to vermeer 's work
1	it would be easy to say that this is the single greatest performance of the mahler eighth ever recorded ; i believe it is . but it would be difficult to say that and have it mean something , because after experiencing this colossal achievement , the competition ( including , alphabetically , abbado , bernstein , chailly , haitink , horenstein , kubelik , nagano , olson [ colorado mahlerfest ] , solti , and tennstedt , among others ) suddenly seemed far less impressive than they once had . what sets this mahler eighth so far apart from virtually every other is its sense of ecstasy ; of a transcendent vision being communicated , of a religious fervor . mahler had an extraordinary plan in putting together what he considered his most important work , such that he could bring us to the brink and say , `` there . it 's out there . you ca n't see it , but you can divine it '' ( and call `` it '' what you will : `` god '' or `` love '' or some all-embracing power outside of ourselves ) . most performances miss the mark , then , in one of two ways : by remaining resolutely earthbound or by trying to capture that vision in terms we can understand . the problem , of course , is that if we can understand it , it 's no longer a vision , it 's something mundane . in the closing pages of wit 's extraordinary ( and that word , as well as any other , hardly begins to do it justice ) performance you become aware of that vision existing just beyond your comprehension . you know it 's there only because you 're willing to take that leap of faith . and that 's what i mean when i say he brings the piece a sense of religious fervor . there is nothing dogmatic about the kind of religion i 'm referring to here . so let 's look at the basic components of the performance , element by element : the sound : spectacularly natural and all-encompassing . the soloists emerge from the overall sonic image like members of the orchestra , and the chorus , orchestra , and organ blend to perfection . the soloists : to a letter the finest group i have ever heard . there 's a distinctly slavic sound that seems altogether appropriate given mahler 's bohemian roots , and a refreshing lack of self-importance . no operatic grandstanding here . and for the first time ever i felt as though i was missing something by not following the words ( no libretto is provided , though it is available online and can be found easily enough elsewhere ) because everyone sounded like they cared dearly about what they were singing . they were n't going through the motions , making pretty sounds . they had something imperative to communicate and wanted us to know it . to be honest , part ii has often bored me to tears ( with chailly 's performance being particularly offensive in this regard ) but here i was literally on the edge of my seat throughout , impatient to hear what ( and who ) came next . and throughout it all , so importantly , there was a sense of spiritual ascent from beginning to end . the choruses : easily the best i 've ever heard . the way they rip into `` hostem repellas longius '' with their shrieks in the great double fugue of part i is unforgettable , and the fugue itself , which has never reminded me more of the `` rabble '' section from the first movement of mahler 's third , literally had my spine tingling throughout its entire course . that 's nothing . i got chills right at the beginning of the chorus mysticus and six and a half minutes later they had not abated ! i have never experienced anything like that before . ever . and i do n't just mean while listening to music . the conductor : what can i say ? he holds the symphony together with a tautness and logic that nobody ever credited this work with having before . how ? i have no idea , but when the start of part ii does n't jar , as it usually does , you know you 're in for something special . maybe it 's because the orchestral prelude there seems faster than usual , or because he finds so much inwardness in the first part ( the first entry of the soloists , for instance , is so raptly caressing ) . the orchestra : while they do n't have the `` mahler sound '' that the concertgebouw or vienna philharmonic may produce , there 's an earthiness ( but never sloppiness ) that sets them far apart from the bleached , sterile sound of too many american orchestras that make mahler sound not like mahler . to sum up , then , i could not speak for an hour after hearing this recording , and still burst into tears at the mere thought of it , especially those radiant , visionary , and extraordinary closing pages . record of the year ; record of the century ! it crowns not merely my mahler collection but an entire lifetime of listening to great music .
1	i heard this music on the excellent p b s documentary : `` liberty - the american revolution '' and i knew i had to have it ! it is the finest music i have heard , capturing the heart and soul of the american revolution . the documentary `` liberty '' was a masterpiece that was beautiful and moving . so too this music with its most wonderful arrangements and accompaniment . i love it ! i could hardly wait to get it in the mail . it framed the documentary ( which i also bought ) like a great frame compliments a beautiful canvas painting . superlatives fail me . this music must be experienced by first watching the great series on the american revolution and then by listening to it apart . this is some of the most wonderful music i have ever heard . it reminds me of the genius of aaron copland who wrote the applachian spring and rodeo suites
1	this is one of my favorites of 2004 . you got a seasoned vet of an mc rockin over some of the illest producers in underground hip hops beats ( madlib , j-zone , dangermouse ) and some pretty nice guest appearances . i have a couple of complaints on this album though , like the song `` love thang '' , the hook is wack and the beat is corny , another wack hook comes thru on the title track where you got prince po sounding like tonto from lone ranger chanting some indian ish , and on top of that in his rhyme he says some sh*t like `` and if the girl farts then she 's a pooter '' ? ? ? thats dumb . one last complaint then i 'm done hatin , but the chorus on bump bump is terrible , and i 'm embarrased to bump bump that ish when i 'm in my car because it sounds so wack , but raekwon 's verse takes me back to when wu tang was the untouchable squad they were back in the mid 90 's , which more than makes up for the lackluster chorus . aside from those complaints you got a dope album , j-zone hit this up with some of best beats i 've ever heard from him . so pick this up its definitely a good purchase
1	rock n ' roll history has many example of band/artists unlucky , that did n't get the recognition they deserve . here 's one . what is big star about ? a rock n ' roll , slightly psychodelic , most influenced by beatles and the byrds . the first record ( # 1 record - 1972 ) is the battle of two frontman putting one classic pop-rock tune after another . chilton gets the most rock stuff , chris the ballads , and also a contribution from hummel , the hippy `` india song '' . best moments : in the streets , thirteen , india song , when my baby 's beside me , my life is right . the second album - radio city - 1973 . chris left the band , claiming that chilton was getting too much control of everything . for this record , hummel contributes more , the band goes torward some stuff slightly different , like the soul intended o my soul ( maybe a reflection of the record label atmosphere . chilton here also takes full control of the musical direction , the albm sounds not better or worse , but less laboured , sounding in some tracks , more like a rehearsal , with a great garage feeling . stevens goes great on drums , specally on back of a car . best tracks : way out west , life is white ( although the harmonica annoys me a little ) , mod lang ( very bowie mood ) , back of a car , september gurls . at a glance , big star reminds me backing home from school , playing my guitar , calling my girlfriend on the phone and waiting for the weekend to go to the beach . a feeling of youthness that does n't come back , just like those special moments in a band 's career that later , they ca n't catch anymore , no matter how hard they try . for big star , no differ , they would never do anything like these two records . and sadly after bell 's death , chances are zero to none . why did n't they succeeded . well , ego stuff , lack of stax knowledge to deal with rock n ' roll bands , and the dicotomy that was ruling the rock n ' roll scene at the time : hard rock versus progressive rock . and what about big star ? neither hard rock , nor progressive . but , despite all that rubish , big star is pure rock n'roll , guitar band , 70 's style , recognizable in many current bands recording all over the world . big star is eternal .
0	if you are looking for boring , lifeless adult contemporary music , then this cd is for you . if you are looking for a great guitar cd , this is n't it . i had such high hopes for this cd after the robert johnson cds and the cream reunion , but all winning streaks must come to an end , and clapton 's comes to a screeching halt with this . of all the eric clapton cds that i like , this is n't one of them . i 'm glad clapton is now in a happy place ( and deservedly so ) , but this cd just does n't do it for me
0	i bought this album because i am so into sigur ros at the moment and it seems all the reviews i read say that `` ... if you like sigur ros you will like mbv.. '' let me say this album is no where near a sigur ros experience . if i could compare them to anyone it would be very early cocteau twins , though i must be clear i do n't think the singer is anywhere close to the artistic sense and vocal talent of elizabeth fraser . it would be more palatable if the production value was higher ... .it sounds terrible . the sound quality is comparable to some old vhs tapes i have from the mid 80 's that i recorded off the tv ( then soaked in water for a few days ! ) .
0	great recording , but if you want to actually use it , like load it on your ipod it has sony 's stupid drm . meaning you ca n't . do n't buy sony products ! !
1	hayley westenra , at only 18 years old , is an enchanting voice we should be hearing from for many years to come . this is an uplifting and at times , spiritual album that shows shades of greatness . throughout , westenra 's voice is captivating , though the musical scores are at times , sub-par and do not equal the vocal talent . there was an advertising tag on this cd that stated `` the female josh grobin '' , but i think a more accurate sentiment would be `` a young sarah brightman '' . odyssey is a fine mix of spiritual and operatic tunes , all of which match up well with westenra 's abilities . bocelli fans will also appreciate the duet , dell amore non si sa . they pair up for that one song , but the rest is all westenra . this is smooth , soothing and easy listening . if you like brightman , you will truly appreciate the voice of westenra .
0	man , have i given this guy a chance . multiple chances . listened to the cds , saw the big hbo special . i mean , his career is red hot now . he clearly has lots of fans . mostly college age ( perhaps this should be a warning to some of you ) . all i can say is `` maybe they 'll grow out of it . '' he is not funny . his act has no bite , no point of view , no opinion/viewpoint at all . his comedy consists of spewing observations his audience can relate to ( the `` this is all happened to us '' or `` has this ever happened to you ? '' school of humor ) . he runs about manically , acting out every little word that comes out of his mouth ( for those in the audience that may not be so good with words ) . his fans acknowledge that , yes , they can relate . `` yeah ! that 's happened to me ! '' `` i know that reference ! ' they laugh , cheer , clap , and plunk down their hard-earned dollars for his vanilla wit . he never actually comments on the things he discusses in any intelligent , interesting way . he has no edge . he 's not outraged by anything . he 's cute 'n ' cuddly . richard pryor must be rolling in his grave at the very fact that cook is classified as a stand up comic . `` pryor ? the guy writing this must be old ! ' okay , try this on for size : chris rock is good comedy . same with dave chappelle . carlin . laura kightlinger . kinison . rodney dangerfield . bob saget . gilbert gottfried . dom irrera . lewis black . robert klein . the late mitch hedberg . jim norton . patton oswalt . brian posehn . degeneres . jon stewart . bob david . the ucb . i 'm not even a big fan of sarah silverman , but at least she 's trying to bring something different to the party . anything but this ! god help us . let 's hope he goes the way of carrot top and dice soon ( do n't forget , cook fans , mr. top and mr. clay were once as popular as your boy here )
1	i love `` fool for the city '' i have also always loved savoy brown `` looking in '' and did n't know until recently that lonesome dave was the singer and most of the savoy brown band went on to form foghat . if you are a foghat fan you should check out `` looking in '' by savoy brown . if you 've heard other stuff by savoy brown and did n't like it , do n't be discouraged because `` looking in '' ( and only `` looking in '' ) is essentially foghat . there were a lot of changes in savoy brown personnel through the years and the guys that did looking in were the best .
1	i heard the chairman dances and went right to amazon to order this . this ia a lovely little gem of a cd , and it is so pleasing to find john adams , another great modern american composer . i 'm also a fan of composers such as christopher rouse , for example , and joe leniado chira is my cousin . modern composers are a precious resource that we should explore , demand more of and nurture . we afficianados would like to see symphony orchestras and ensembles giving more attention to the modern genre . meanwhile , john adams has impressed me with this disc . the chairman dances is my favorite . i can just see chairman mao doing a vigorous foxtrot to this , and tricky dick feeling jealous . this might be the music that opened china to the west
0	perhaps it 's a bit unfair because lucinda engenders such high expectations , but i was really disappointed with this record the songwriting is weak , the singing is weak , and the arrangements are dull something kicked all the life out of the music -- the songs are not all the same , but for some reason they all sound the same -- and embarrassingly , you can sing most of them after one listen , they are so simplistic and cliched
1	i love this cd ! i often put it in my personal cd player and take it to the coffee shop to help me as i study french . the music is relaxing but not sleep-inducing . steven halpern composes great music
