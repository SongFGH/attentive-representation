0	while microsoft tries very hard to make office `` think ahead of me , '' they almost always seem to get it wrong . the result is a package that consistently annoys me . it is true that one can turn off the `` helpful '' hints and otherwise customize the programs so that they are less hindering , however the bloated package will nevertheless usurp your computers resources like nobody 's business . in my opinion , office '97 was an excellent package , and the versions since then have gone steadily downhill . as with many people , i use office at work because i have no choice . at home i 've had good luck with staroffice from sun . while not perfect , staroffice has read and created files compatible with microsoft office very consistently in my experience , and it 's a whole lot less expensive . i am therefore hesitant to recommend microsoft office professional edtition 2003 to anyone except those who need the most advanced functions of excel and/or need to use access database frequently .
1	this is one program that in my opinion you get more than what you pay for i have several immaging programs that i use for several different things . this one is a delight to use and does a great job taking most of the work off the user . its a microsoft program that is very user friendly and easy to use . however you do have to be some what computer savy , ( like know where to turn on the computer kind of thing ) not like some of the 1 star comments that were made here by other folks . i would recomend it to all people that need a simple to use program . its not what you pay for something its what you do with it after you get it
0	this is the stupidest game i ever saw for sale- my kids laughed at how poorly the graphics and story were . what a complete waste
0	i 've been using spysweeper for 2 years now . it generally does what it is supposed to do . however , it was nearing time for me to renew . spysweeper becomes a huge , irritating nag when it comes time to renew . not only does the software bug you all the time , but webroot sends out reminder e-mails too . with 3 weeks left on my subscription , i decided to renew , mostly just to get rid of all the nagging . well , guess what ? - the renewal process reset my expiration date . rather than giving me 3 weeks plus 1 year , the renewal starts immediately , and ends in exactly 1 year - which means , that i 've been ripped off for 3 weeks of paid subscription . maybe webroot thinks their users are too stupid to notice this deceptive practice of moving up renewal dates . i 've complained to them - and if they do n't make amends , then i can not recommend this product to anyone
0	the video editing part of this software is completely useless . it did n't come with a manual and i ended up buying on my own a book about how to use it . it has n't made a difference . the software is completely uncooperative . my computer more than meets the minimum requirements for running the program . if you bought this software for the video editing , i recommend using the disc as a drinks coaster and buying something else
1	this is a great item for any collector or new fans to the x-men . all the older along with the newer issues look great . the cd includes all issues of the uncanny x-men ( 1-461 ) along with giant sized and annual issues . there is also comprehensive biographies on the more popular characters and artwork and layouts of the xaiver institute . could it of had more content , maybe , but this will keep one busy for a long time . with easy maneuverabiltity , this is a highly addictive cd with virtually months of entertainment
1	i was using other internet security programs in the past . all had their pros and cons . i decided to switch to pc-cillin 2006 home security pack and it is the best available ! . it has both virus and spyware protections built in . the scanning is quick and the updates are easy to get . plus this home security 3 pack is able to be installed on 3 computers , a bargain . all in all i am sold on this easy to use and comprehensive software product . i highly recommend this product to all ! amazon.com as usual had the best price
1	i wanted to see if i could do all the essential digital image editing `` on the cheap '' in pse5 ... and i am satisfied that i have been able to do just that . the best companion book i 've seen to assist in that effort is this one : adobe photoshop elements 5.0 maximum performance : unleash the hidden performance of elements by mark galer . the combination of the pse5 software and book proved to be perfect for me , and as near as i can tell , i can now do all the image editing i need to do , at a fraction of the cost and time required for the full-on photoshop product . i 'm very satisfied with my purchase . if you 're on the fence about it , i 'd recommend downloading the 30 day trial version from the adobe website prior to purchasing
0	warning ! i resized my partition and when it restarted my computed could not boot . it destroyed my system and i had to format my whole drive . read all the reviews from this program carefully . i read them but did not believe them
1	notice , you need at least 2gb ram not 1gb and vista it is for you !
1	i have used synmatec products for many years and have been fairly pleased by them . however , do n't buy the upgrade or renew your subscription until after your current subscription runs out because synmatec will not give you credit for the un-used portion of your previous subscription . i asked and they said `` no way '' . that aspect of `` customer service '' is very disappointing
0	i have always used norton antivirus , and had no problems with it at all . i have recently had to migrate to outlook 2003 and norton is 2005 and have non-stop system crashes . i have now uninstalled it and resinstalled my old version of norton professional and hey presto everything is working again - and not talking two hours to load .
0	do not use this product . it is very hard to remove from your computer . it is harder to install than norton , and is an inferior product . i will never buy their product again .
0	this software did n't quite do what i expected . i was somewhat disappointed when i discovered that it would n't convert itunes m4p music files to mp3 files to run on a real player .
0	i bought this product based on consumer reports review . i 've had norton and mcafee in the past which slowed down my system . my computer is slower to start up with zonealarm , but faster than mcafee while on . however , most of the time , i need to shut off zonealarm in order to access the internet - just like another reviewer . defeats the purpose do n't you think ? it also recognized my offices 's software as a virus and although i allowed access , it keeps showing it as a virus . i 'm going to have to go to another product .
1	this product is very superior over prior versions.it plays back your text in your own voice.my accuracy has improved in dragon naturallyspeaking 9 over other previous versions i have used . having been familiar with prior programs voice to text , it was easy to implement.it was a good investment . the product came promptly , and with no hassles
0	this is not the most recent version for this software . do an online search , check the manufacturer 's web site and you 'll find it cheaper for the latest version
0	if you read the license , you find that you probably give away rights to anything you use in a comic book . it also looks like you ca n't give away copies of comics you print , certainly ca n't sell them , and ca n't let others copy them . unless you want your child 's face on a cereal box without your permission , you probably do n't want this software
0	i bought this software to print my christmas cards and much to my dismay , it did not print properly on my hp inkjet printer . i tried various settings with the same bad results and finally had to contact tech support via email . here is the reply : `` thank you for contacting hallmark technical support . we apologize for any difficulties that you may have had with our software . this is a newly found issue with the program . the developers are currently working on an update that will correct this . they said that the update should be out around christmas . please routinely check for new updates by going to the help menu and selecting the check for updates option . when an update is available , you will be informed and it should automatically install the update . '' this is a `` printing '' software so when it does not print properly , it indicates that the software was not tested properly or simply the publisher expect the users to be beta-testers ! if some other features that did not work , it may be excused , but this bug is unexcusable ! i am sure the software developers will have the software bugs fixed , but at the meantime do n't be a beta-tester , buy someting else . humbug !
0	this product is horrifying . it worked for three months , at which point it experienced a complete meltdown . started getting auto-protect errors , and suddenly could access the internet with explorer , but not firefox . it kept trying to send me to live update , which would n't work , so i uninstalled and reinstalled norton . now the error happened again , and i could access the internet with firefox , but not explorer . an error message referred me to an online `` fix , '' but -- guess what ! -- you ca n't access any of their fixes with firefox . you must be using explorer . ( which is , in and of itself , offensive and obnoxious . ) explorer , of course , was n't working . ( incidentally , with norton uninstalled , all worked fine , so that was indeed the source of the problem . ) uninstalled and reinstalled norton again , hoping to get on explorer and get the fix before the error recurred , but now i could n't get on the internet at all . at that point , i uninstalled norton for good . ditto on the fact that they do n't support the product , apparently do n't stand behind the product , and apparently are n't very concerned about their reputation . very disappointing . previous versions were just fine ; this is a complete mess
0	i was thoroughly disappointed . the first few words i looked up in the thesaurus were not listed -- words like upholstery ! when i went online to see what i might be able to glean from their online site , first fogware had not sent me a coupon , then i had to deal with bad customer service ( i am not doing business with any companies anymore that give bad support ) then after i finally got the coupon code they had left out of my box , the online info is exactly what we have in the cd -- so save your money and do not subscribe to their extended services site unless you need a spanish online dictionary also ! very bad ! i am now going to go buy roget 's and check it out
0	unit gives inconsistant results especially with front projection sets . spyder also requires room to be as dark as possible in order to make adjustments . this is not always practical . the tripod mount fits too loose on spyder and easily falls off . i think this is a good beginning to a potentially fine product , but not yet ready for prime time
1	this upgrade installed easily with my photoshop 5.5 . no problems at all . this is an excellent program and leap years ahead of my photoshop 5.5 . this is a much less expensive way to upgrade to cs2..rather than purchasing cs2 outright . be sure to get the updates after you install the program .
0	i have moderate knowledge of computers , etc . and i found this overly complicated . this is not intended for the novice . however , even if you are not a novice it seems to still be a waste of money . i wish i had not bought it at all . perhaps it has secrets and treasures i am not aware of ... but the directions are complicated and it would be by chance that you would ever discover them . save your money ... this was a waste
1	the computer game version of the number devil closely follows the book , as kids progress through sections on prime numbers , the fibonacci series , pascal 's triangle , and an infinite series approaching one . nine of the ten games worked well for us , but nobody in the family was ever able to complete the tenth , the arrow game . we understood the math , but could n't react quickly enough to shoot down all the arrows . this was disappointing , because we could never reach the bonus section . all in all , though , this is a good investment for a child , 8 or up , who loves or wants to understand the mystery of numbers
1	office 2007 was a very nice improvement over previous versions . the program was stable , for me at least , and the new interface was very nice . it may take a few minutes to find where some commands have been moved to but the result was a much cleaner interface . one thing that keeps in mind is that it uses a different file format from previous versions by default . there is the option of changing the format to the previous version but the default option is n't compatible with earlier programs
0	it 's definitely an awful piece of software . it 's totally unstable under winxp sp2 and ie7 . follow other peoples advice and get quicken '06
1	i had the software in just a couple days and it was exactly as i ordered . along with it came an information sheet on what to do and who to contact if there were any problems . great job . would order from them again
0	be careful with this program . my wife bought it , and i tried to install it for her on our pc . i made several attempts , and each time installation hung at a different stage of the installation procedure . when installation hung , i could not cancel or kill it , or even shut down the pc without pressing the reset button ( on windows xp pro ) . i went to the support page of the web site , and found a faq item about incompatibility with zone alarm . if you 're not familiar with zone alarm , it is a personal firewall and security product that is very common among home users . according to nova development , the only way to get scrapbook factory deluxe 3.0 to install is to permanently remove zone alarm . besides being a serious security risk , this is an extreme measure to have to take . this seems to be perfectly ok with nova development . they offer no workaround other than removing zone alarm from the pc . personally , this would be enough to give me pause about installing the product even if i did not use zone alarm . you have to wonder what the installer is trying to do that even the presence of dormant security software interferes with it .
1	as one who is not an accountant , i found quickbooks premier non-profit edition 2006 to be very easy to learn . read the books that come with the software before you dive in
0	i bought the software ( digital image suite 2006 ) before i bought my camera - to be ready to process the pictures i was going to take . a big mistake . i bought a canon 30d camera and record my images in raw format ( *.cr2 ) . unfortunately , not all canon .cr2 raw files are the same . so , even though the software says you can edit .cr2 raw images , it depends on which camera made the image . here is complaint number two - if you use microsoft 's customer service/technical support you will be routed to india - and they will just give you an answer that is vaguely related to your problem . after emailing several times and getting nowhere you will find out that you ca n't write to their washington state headquarters unless you have the name of someone in the address . so , basically , microsoft is the largest technical software company in the world with the worst customer service and no american technical support . now , for the final complaint . there is no link or method to get updates or upgrades for this program ! so , if i want to use a microsoft software package to edit my photo images then i will have to buy a new software package - is n't that wonderful .
0	feeling more than a bit fleeced by mcafee 's overpriced `` subscription '' renewal every year , i decided to give kaspersky a try . installation went smoothly and everything seemed fine for 2 or 3 weeks . then one day my computer would not boot -- -just stalled on a blank screen right after the windows xp splash screen . when trying to boot up in safe mode , a list of the drivers currently loading scrolled down the screen . it stopped at a file called kl1.sys and hung there forever . a little research at work showed that this was a kaspersky file . it may be just a coincidence that my system suddenly went kaput shortly after installing the new antivirus program , but i doubt it . attempts to use a recovery disk failed . a trip to the local computer shop revealed that the data on my hard drives ( which were in the inscrutable raid 0 format ) could not be recovered ( unless i wanted to ship them to a recovery shop , and nothing on them was worth that much ) . so they 're going to reinstall windows , i 'll have to do reinstall a shipload of software when i finally get my computer back , and , yes , i 'll lose all the data that was on there . ( gee , good thing i backed up all the kids ' photos -- -well , most of them . thanks , kaspersky ! ) anyway , perhaps my attempts at recovering the os caused the worst of this . whatever the case , i believe the boot failure was caused by either the kaspersky file being corrupted or a virus . who knows . kaspersky is to blame in both scenarios . i do know one thing : i am not going to tempt fate by loading this program on my computer again . and kaspersky has yet to respond to my e-mail . i got an automated `` we received your e-mail '' response , but nothing more , even though they state that they usually respond within a day or two . that was over a week ago . if in fact their software is in no way responsible for my computer flaking out on me , then i still do not apologize for the one-star rating , given their horrible customer service . if you decide i 'm insane or that this was just a fluke , at least do yourself a favor and make a decent boot disk for yourself before installing this product . that might mean the difference between losing data/spending $ $ $ and just being inconvenienced . and do n't expect much assistance from kaspersky should things go wrong .
1	this is a good inexpensive gps system . it does a good job of tracking your location . the map is excellent . the labeling is not as good as the previous version . poi finder is top notch
0	generally like the program . hoped it came with a cd to practice in the car but was wrong . it is totally pc based . i 'll let you know in about three months if i can actually conduct business in deutsch .
1	this is a really great bargain . the spreadsheets are easy to use with built-in formulas just like excel , instead of paying hundreds of dollars . this was better than i expected for the money . excellent product , would highly recommend it for any home business , small business or everyday budgets , events and home bookkeeping . this is a 5 star program
1	this software offers simple and easy to use way of getting ones affairs in order
0	i have been using frontpage since 1997 . i am webmaster for three websites and have alway really thought this was a great program ! but ! i have only upgraded to frontpage 2000 and find that with my xp computer , win xp does not support frontpage . now , if i want to continue with my family genealogy site and a community genealogical society site , i will need to purchase and learn another program . at age 70 , i really do n't feel like doing that ! does anyone know if fp 2003 will work on win xp ? or how can i get my fp 2000 to work on my win xp computer ?
1	i got a hold of a windows vista ultimate disk . it gave the choice to install home basic , home premium , business , or ultimate . i installed vista home basic , because i only have 512 mb of ram . likes : i like the new wallpapers and the way it looks . my documents and my music folder remind me of itunes . dislikes : do n't like that my less than 6 month old hp printer does n't work with vista and my usb net link cable does n't work with vista . when you install something screen slowly fades out and then a window comes up asking you if you want to run the program and trust it . it 's a little annoying because it forces you to stop what your doing and answer the question before you can continue . verdict : i like it , but the incompatibility issues are enough for me to want to stick with xp . i would n't buy home basic . if you really want vista , buy a new computer with vista preinstalled or install a trial version of vista to make sure everything works . i 'm going back to xp , until hp releases vista drivers for my printer . i 'll write reviews on home premium , business , and/or ultimate if i ever get more ram . my computer 2.8 ghz pentium d 512 mb ram 128 mb video car
1	i decided to get this office suite after using it recently . i 've usually worked on office 97 and 2000 , but the 2003 version has some pretty cool features not found in the older versions . the feature that i really enjoy is the pivot report feature in ms access , which was n't in ms access 2000 . this is a truly great reporting feature . you can now use access as a front-end to slice and dice data stored on data warehouses in oracle , sql server , sybase and other enterprise-type databases . if you 're used to creating crosstab reports , you 'll definitely like the pivot report feature . crosstabs are limited to 2 dimensions but there 's no limitation on the number of dimensions in pivot report . to me , the main drawback is the price . ( i did get mine at around $ 370 at j , which is a great price . ) i figure i can upgrade this in about 5 years time , which works out to about $ 70 to $ 75 per year ( assuming that i 'll be paying about $ 370 to upgrade in 5 years time . ) a big positive is that this is the industry standard . so the work you put into learning the multiple new features of word , excel , ms access is not wasted because you can reuse the same skills in another job . your time will be well spent . note that the software may seem bloated but the intelligent user is able to choose and pick the most useful and relevant features of each application and ignore the features that are not useful . different features are useful to different people ... another positive : each product in office professional is fully programmable using visual basic for applications ( vba ) which you can use to build custom programs . this very powerful feature is sometimes overlooked when shopping for office suites .
1	this is the best version of office yet . the differences are numerous and very significant , it is well worth the investment !
1	drills are excellent , vocabulary has good variety ... picking up the grammar from the application without explanation is tough for me , but i guess that 's the way kids learn any language .
0	i am extremelly disappointed with roxio , the makers of cd creators ; especailly easy cd creator 5 . i purchased easy cd creator 5 , sometime back from an affiliate of amazon.com . it was dispatched promptly and in very good condition . i installed it on my computer running windows 98 . after some initial problmes it was running fine . a few days back i installed windows xp professional on my computer , and i got a message that the cd creator was not compatible with this version of windows . it hinted to contact roxio . i tried contact roxio with the help of the link , but found it impossible to send them my message . they have an automated `` roxann '' that is so difficult to understand . next they invite you to a `` webticket '' and you are supposed to mention your problem on it . but when you submit your query or complain , nothing happens . the site just stares at you dumbly ! ! there is no way to obtain roxio 's mailing address either . so now i am stuck with this `` easy cd creator 5 '' with no help from roxio ?
1	i read horror storied about 7.0 nero so i upgraded to 6.6 from 5.5 by going to the amazon new used market . this is a good program that does all you need for dvd 's and cd 's . it gets good reviews . i ca n't imagine what happened to 7.0 but they may have gotten carried away with `` user friendly-ness '' - i see a little of that in 6.6 compared to 5.5
0	picassa , part of the google suite of programs , is both better than this program and free ! what more do i need to add ? the user interface of picassa is easier to use and more responsive
1	i do n't know what other people are complaining about . i just installed vista ultimate a few days ago and i absolutely love it . no interface lag or any other lag at all . maybe the people complaining have weak or outdated hardware . those people need to turn down their settings if their not going to keep their computers on the cutting edge or at least near it . i 'm glad microsoft is n't waiting for people to catch up and are on the cutting edge . i 'd rather be the one catching up than the other way around . i have a core 2 duo e6300 overclocked to 2.5ghz , 2 gigs of ram , a geforce 7600gt and a western digital raptor 150g hd and vista ultimate works flawlessly on my computer . it 's not the best computer but it runs flawlessly , i built it myself and all the parts cost me about $ 850 off the net . i play world of warcraft among some other games and i have n't seen any problems yet with any games or any of the major software i use as of yet . i 've only encountered one problem and that was with my old soundblaster live ! 5.1 sound card which has discontinued support . no big deal , it was about time to get a better one anyway . vista is awesome , i love everything about it . it 's very futuristic and it is not a simple interface makeover at all like some clueless dummies proclaim . by the way , i only paid $ 110 for vista ultimate upgrade off ebay , check there first if you already have an existing os and want to save some dough
0	after purchasing this product , i found there were several problems with scanning . i contacted nuance ( who purchased scansoft ) to ask for assistance from technical support . however , i then learned they want $ 9.95 for each incident when a request is made by email . not by phone - by email . after putting out a great deal of money for this product , i should not have to pay $ 9.95 for assistance with each issue that is a problem with their product . save yourself a great deal of grief and avoid this product . i regret that amazon does not allow me to give this product `` 0 '' stars .
0	bought this 3-pack about 2 months ago ( three computers at home ) and worked ok- no viruses . then i did what i thought was a clean install of xp pro from xp home on one of the computers , and it carried over a lot of garbage from xp home i wanted to get rid of , but that 's another issue ( clean install ? } . after installing xp pro , i was warned i did n't have virus protection and so i tried installing my nav again . you would think at some point nav would have enough brains to try and establish that this was a windows upgrade , and that the nav was legitimate . nope- fatal error and computer lock-up , which i was able to survive . no contact opportunity at the symantec web site . i simply opted for microsoft 's recommended anti-virus software- computer associates . another twenty . then i had a heck of a time uninstalling nav , which would n't install and now would n't uninstall . what a waste of time and money . who creates these viruses ? we certainly know who benefits from them . there is really nothing you can do- they are immune unless they hurt someone with media clout . this little note means diddily , but thanks to amazon anyhow for the opportunity to say something .
0	i was able to install most of ms office but am having printer conpatability problems . i was n't able to install vitural pc properly and get error messages when i boot up . i 'm going to have to the mac store genius bar to get the problems straightened out . all in all i think that every thing will work ok but i 'm going to have yto travel over 50 miles to get it fixed . maybe it 's best to stick with mac software for macs . i 've never has a problem installing them
0	this program does not allow you to switch to elevation and view or alter framing details . i 'm only using it for a simple garage and i expected to be able to generate simple working plans with basic demensions . not so . you might as well pick up a copy of the sims so you could at least have some fun with it . if you want to get rough ideas this might be for you but if you actually want to work from it , forget it . very disappointing waste of money
0	this software is fine for altering digital pictures if you do not have any other programs , but if you want to make exciting slideshows , this software is very basic and not user-friendly . i had technical problems from the start . you are better off using ms powerpoint than this software
1	product has a nice clean interface . i was able to load most drivers and application software without incident . note - upgrade install requirements are not clear . microsoft should state what is expected on your system prior to trying to install either as an upgrade or clean install . microsoft sites keep pointing back to sites that do n't help very much .
0	i got this game because i thought it would be fun . i was totally wrong ! every customer that i got brought only rabbits . rabbits , rabbits , rabbits ! ! ! this game confused me a lot . also , it gets very boring . and , it 's very hard to control . do n't waste your money on this game ! it will be a total waste of your money . believe me
1	i 've been using printmaster for years to create greeting cards , party invitations , banners and posters for my kids ' school . this version has a lot of great new art and images and my son has even made personalized cover for his ipod . i 'd reccomend it to anyone who likes printmaster or wants to create great-looking projects at home
0	i 've been using apple 's macintosh systems since 1984 and have seen some great improvements in system stability , which i consider the most important aspect of an os . first off tiger is a smooth running system ( when it is smoothly running ) , and has some of the nicest bells and whistles around . the best dog-and-pony show around . that being said , watch out ! this os is capable of completely hosing your user settings , all your software registrations , bookmarks , email settings , etc . the whole enchilada . any os that can do that at the drop of a dime is n't worth the time . since i use disk warrior , cocktail and disk utility regularly , this should never have happened . i waited until the os was at the 10.4.3 stage before upgrading from 10.3.9 -- apparently it is not yet ready -- best to wait another year before upgrading . hopefully these bugs will be fixed
0	talk about junk ! no search capability , mislabeled cds , some cds wo n't run - in short , yuk !
0	after years of e-filing fees being included with the purchase price , it would have been more forthcoming for turbotax to put a large sticker on the front of their box alerting buyers to the price that they will pay for e-filing each return . i lost the value of my entire state return - and then some - through e-filing fees : $ 44.95 ( plus tax ) for the program , $ 16.95 ( plus tax ) for each return e-filed ( i filed two ) and a little bonus fee to the company that handles the [ credit card ] transaction ( that fee is never quoted in the program and i will have to wait for my credit card statement to find out what that is ) . in addition , anyone who chooses to have the fees deducted from his/her refund has to pay an additional $ 30 . the product does what it says . but , for the cost , and less-than-honest way in which the change occured ( it almost seemed deceitful - hence the single star rating ) , i would have preferred to have given my money to my friendly neighborhood accountant . people expect change , even if they do n't like it . but , suprises that cost customers money are never welcome and drive customers away . surely the marketing/advertising gurus can think of a way to alert the customer of a significant change such as this and even put a `` positive '' spin on it . `` filing fees only $ 16.95 [ per return ] - less than the cost of a tax professional . . . '' no more turbotax for me
0	... for indesign to not have one basic features . everyone i know still does french folds , but in order to see double page spreads in indesign you have to lay them out wrong in the program , then you have to painstakingly go through your document and shift the entire document by one page , layout by layout . this is mortally stupid . at this point adobe should have figured how a tool like i.d . is actually used in conjunction with a printer , not just assumed the user wants to print what they see on their screen . the oversight is the difference between avergage klunky desktop publishing software and a great layout tool . why is n't there a button that toggles me between the layout view and priont output ? why do i have to slave over a document like this ? adobe , stop thinking in the abstract and investigate how your software can facilitate printed results . also who knows how you get an alpha path or clipping path into this ? mine shows me a heavily pixelated , entirely xparent bw image when it supposed to be a cropped color image . what do you want me to do with that
0	i wanted to use this product to tape sporting events , as part of a promotions unit i belong to . i had used videowave 7 which was ok and produced a more than adequate product , but would on occassion crash to the extent i would have to reload the software . i thought i would give pe 3.0 ago , since adobe products generally have a good reputation . well , it goes to show that you ca n't just rely on reputation . the program lets me down horribly when capturing the video from the camera . the camera records dvd video ( vob files ) straight to dvd . when i capture these files into the pe program , all moving images within the video become pixelated with lost resolution to the point of being useless . i have tried various other ways of capturing but always the same result . there is nothing to be done from that point ... for me this program falls on the first hurdle ! ! it is unbelievable to me that a professionally released image processing algorithm could corrupt video so badly , and frustrating that i actually paid money for it ... a first year undergraduate could have provided a better effort . i have subsequently gone through the motions to produce a video , and to be honest he layout of the settings , ease of applicaiton of various functions is quite good and better than videowave 7 imho . i was able to produce quite nice edited products with intro , text and audio overlays very quickly . still this is n't much use when the video itself had already been digitally butchered . if you are videoing things that do n't move you may well like this product . if you are videoing dynamic scenes , give it a miss . big disappointment
0	i thought this would be a good product for my computer . i did n't know that the only way to receive this product is over the internet via download . during the process the prompts for the internet download ask you to remove ( uninstall/delete ) all of your known antivirus , spyware , and firewalls from your computer prior to install . this leaves your computer susceptible when you receive an error message . i received an error message that prevented me from completing the download . i purchased the software on aug 3 and called customer support , they researched the problem and even took remote access of my computer to try and fix the issue . they were unable to do so and then passed me to the second level of computer technicans . microsoft guards its secrets well and has varying levels of technical support , those that know the basics and those that know more . they asked me to set up a time span when i would like to receive a call from the `` teir ii '' agents , i chose 6-9pm . i received several calls over the next two weeks , all of them were outside of the specified time . i missed several of them because i have a career and a life . when i finally spoke with an agent they again took over remote access of my computer and were also unable to solve the issue . here it was , two weeks after i purchased the software , i still did not have what i needed . i was also unable to surf the web because the download process requires you to delete all antivirus and firewall software . i called in several times druing the ordeal and the `` teir i '' agents just told me that i have to wait for the call , `` they 'll get to it when they get to it . '' i was very upset with the customer support , i have no idea how the product is , but the customer support is just horrible . go to the windows live onecare home page and search for the `` post your own thoughts '' page through member accounts , you 'll see that i 'm not alone in this issue . i have since purchased other software that cover what microsoft says it will with onecare . i did not have one problem with these installs . please be aware that you might have to purchase technical support if you can not download due to a problem with your operating system ( seperate from onecare ) . this costs an additional $ 35 ontop of the cost for onecare
0	as a teacher i use word , powerpoint , and publisher when working with students and engaging in professional activities ( presentations to organizations , etc . ) i have been using office 2002 , and thought i should upgrade . big mistake . the ribbons of icons are frustrating to scroll through , especially since i previously just customized the toolbar so everything i needed was immediately available . i 'm still trying to figure out how to type in chinese , although the spanish and german are working fine . additionally , they 've come up with a truly ugly color scheme for their ribbons/icons/etc . as a previous commenter noted , making changes to the basic template creates extreme problems , and i also was unable to get the darn number bullets to renumber . it took me almost twice as long to write a test as usual , and i ended up doing manually what used to be done quite easily using the toolbar . the designs in publisher are now very difficult to see and differentiate . in previous versions , you could see the stark differences between different designs . in the current options pages , everything is so soft , both in line and color , as well as being so small , that it 's hard to tell what you 're looking at . but the truly big disappointment is powerpoint . their new selection of slide designs has all the appeal of rotting road kill -- i would be embarrassed to give a presentation to a professional group using what is available in 2007 . i have reinstalled my 2002 programs . i feel like i just wasted all the money i spent on this suite . my suggestion ? if you absolutely have to have a pc because you do a lot of word processing , stick with word 2002 or 2003 . if you need to do presentations/brochures/etc . for your business , get a mac and avoid this problem altogether
0	i recently tried to update my norton systemworks . halfway through the update , i got a message telling me it was unable to uninstall my old norton systemworks . i tried to back out of the installation at that point , but was unable . i called the norton company , spent an hour on the phone with a tech , only to have them tell me it was my computer . i assured them that i was just using my computer , which was fine , and now it does n't work . they told me there was nothing further that they could do , and that i would have to call a computer service company . i found out that the uninstall process corrupted my operating system , causing me to lose everything on my hard drive , and requiring a new operating system . i have run into other people who had exactly the same problem , with no help from the norton company . i will never again buy a norton product . i only wish i could get my money back from them .
1	i think this is actually a very good os . there are a lot of new features and home premium appears to be the best vista os for the money . i purhased a new pc with this os and have really found no compelling reason to upgrade to ultimate for $ 150 . only legitimate gripe concerns drivers for non-microsoft products . not excatly sure why this is microsoft 's problem though . regardless , this os is the smart choice for a new pc for home use . accept a minimum required graphics and audio card until suppliers catch up with this new os . then upgrade . otherwise , wait till you need a new pc
0	what a complete pain ! ... .. we now use macs . however , i decided to take the california bar examination july 2006 . the california bar examiners allow the use of laptops utilizing a software program written by examsoft . presently , the software will only work on windows xp . moreover , the california bar examiners will not allow any macs , even the newer macs with the intel processors which require complete re-booting into windows . as a result , i was forced to upgrade my gateway laptop , a fine laptop as far as pcs are concerned , in order to sit for this bar examination . ( that , or purchase a new laptop , which was probably the point . ) thank god for gateway computer technical support as the microsoft folks are clueless : even though the warranty on my gateway laptop expired some time ago , gateway has walked me through more issues during the installation process than i can possibly discuss here . conversely , microsoft simply bounces me around from one tech support person to the next until the telephone becomes disconnected . ... .. i suspect that the marketing strategy is that new software ( any new software ) will only work with the newer versions of windows xp or vista , and since vista will be such a memory hog , consumers eventually will be forced to dump their pcs which can not be upgraded , for new pcs . as for how the operating system actually works : a grade of fair . yesterday , the microsoft update website was down which , according to microsoft 's discussion website seemed to be a problem with other window users as well . typical
1	i use microsoft streets and trips 2007 in a laptop computer for navigational assistance anytime i 'm traveling to a destination where i 'm not absolutely certain how to get there . in general , i 'm pleased with it 's performance . it has saved me from wrong turns many times . however , the data seems to be as much as five years out of date on many street additions . gps tracking on country roads is inaccurate enough to cause constant `` off route '' - `` back on route '' messages as you navigate twists and turns . i suspect , in that case , the map data is just not that accurate
0	this dude is selling info that you can learn from anyone with very limited computer knowledge . all of the same info is on the net for free . this product exists for one purpose ... to steal from you . this pathetic thief has gone through the trouble of putting together an eleaborate scam to steal from his customers by charging their credit card 80 bucks a month without their permission . he could have used his energy and tallents to just make a good product ... but scams seem to be his thing . avoid ! ! this is the worst company that i have ever delt with in my entire life . this john guy and anyone that works for him should be ashamed . he is an embarrasement to his company and his family . at least a mugger steals from me face to face ... this snake is sneaky about it
1	i checked around before making this purchase , and amazon had the best price for print shop . i love it , i 've used it for a couple of projects and i have no complaints . it 's like a one stop shopping for all your publishing needs
1	it 's a great product . especially for someone like me who works long hours and no chance of getting to take a language class formally , this is the way to go ! thank you
0	it only became clear to me how ms undermines mac by using its software as weapon when i began using ms office for mac . i have used window 's based excel everyday at work for the last 20 years and i can not figure out how to use the mac version efficiently . it seems like an ersatz version from 15 years ago . if you want to work on powerpoint docs at home created on your pc at work you will find the effort not worth it ... the docs will never transfer formatting properly . i bought this program and almost never use it because it is just so clumsy compared to the pc version . having said that , there is no alternative to ms office ; this is the outcome of ms having monopoly power ... no support and an inferior product for mac user
0	i am a software tech . i first `` free trial '' v6 online- 1 . finds 131 errors , but will only fix 4 ( must buy full version ! ) . sheesh ! 2 . buy full version with 20 % off coupon ( 3 computer lic , for only $ 9.95 more- their web site ) . 3 . does not remove left/overs ... , from old uninstalled pgms . ( fix-it utilities `` 6 '' safely did- read my review ) . 4 . then they only support updates ... for 1 year- auto-renew ! rip-off ! i got a refund , and will never use them again
1	so i did the unthinkable . i put windows vista business on my mac -- specifically my mac mini . it works great , no system slow downs and no crashes . the mac handles vista beautifully . i had no problems using boot camp 1.2 in order to install it . the mac drivers for vista ( included with boot camp ) all worked fine . the vista installation took all of about 30 minutes including some updates and such . i had windows xp home on my mac b4 and while it worked well , vista business works much more smoothly . as you may or may not know a mac mini is not exactly a powerhouse computer . i have a 1.66 gigahertz core duo with 1gb of ram on it . it displays the aero interface perfectly especially hooked up to my 32 inch widescreen lcd tv . seems even the lowest cost mac can still make vista shine while most pcs cant . one disclaimer tho . all intel macs can run vista ultimate without a hitch except the mac mini ( which can only go up to business/home premium ) while vista is still behind os x 10.4 ( tiger ) its a much better release from xp . now im just waiting to upgrade my little mac mini in october for the release of os x 10.5 ( leopard )
0	i 've been a user of pinnacle version 8 ( which i loved ) , and needed to update to a version that could burn dual layer dvds . what a disappointment this `` upgrade '' has been . crash after crash . what is most disappointing is that pinnacle built in a feed back system so the users could `` help '' them develop a better product . this means to me that they knowingly released bad code , and used their customers as guinny pigs while sticking us for a $ 100 . guess what , i do n't want to help pinnacle build a better product . i want a product that works when i purchase it . lesson learned . next time i read a bad review on a product , i 'm staying away
1	for anybody who needs the full power of acrobat , this is the way to go . highly recommende
1	this new version of illustrator is great , glad i upgraded ! the live trace feature is cool
1	this was a wonderful game ! hours of good , solid game play . an interesting mystery and intriguing characters . a chance to interact with aquatic life . i learned how to work a gps and a ham radio . it was so much fun . the puzzles were a good mix of ability-levels and types . word puzzles , spatial puzzles , problem-solving ones . i can completely recommend this game
1	i have been using pc-cillin after dumping mcafee following some lousy customer support with no issues . this new version i was very concerned after reading all of the reviews . it does seem to slow things a little on my amd pc if i am running all of the options i can run but even with them it is tolerable . i am sure you would not want to run this on anything less but it does work and managing it has been simple .
1	microsoft office ultimate 2007 is fairly good once you know how to use it . it is a a little difficult if you are new to how the menus work but once you know how they work it is fairly simple to use
0	so far we have been unable to use this product in the way we want to use it . we contacted tech support , but after one call , we will be charged $ 19.95 for each call . i have been disappointed in the product and the company
1	i have been running xp for a few days and so far so good . i was running win98se and decided to upgrade after microsoft announced that they no longer support win98 . my software is now obsolete ? yikes ! well , i 'm glad i upgraded . installation went smooth as silk and i have not experienced any problems at all . i had to find a couple of new drivers for hardware but that 's been it . and for home edition versus pro , i think i can be quite happy with the home edition . i will say that win98se had been a headache for a long time so the stability that i see so far with xp home is a relief . good features , good reliability . a very decent upgrade . i recommend it . four stars
1	have been using acrobat since v3 , v4 , v6 . v8 is in line . seems a bit faster , smoother etc . have tried imitations on other machines . from a purely subjective view , acrobat is best . a bit pricey , but the best . with the usual caveats , can be installed on a desktop and a notebook , but requires a call to tech support which was quick and smooth
1	i 've used version 2003 and enjoyed it thoroughly . i primarily used it for school with different classes and notes for each . what was great is that is consolidates everything in a way that makes it easy to retrieve your notes . it also makes it easy to generate reports based on the tagging feature . the tags allow you to highlight and gather key points of information that make writing papers a breeze . when working with paper , this was not always an easy task to take on . several weeks ago , i downloaded the trial version of onenote 2007 . the improvements are rather subtle , but powerful . it did n't take anything to get comfortable with the new features . after a short time with the trial version i just purchased it because it was so much fun . here are some of the beneficial features : -like a paper notebook you have sections , but with onenote 2007 you can have as many sections as you like . -you can easily link pages to outlook . i have linked appointments to a series of notes and support files for various projects and meetings . it makes being organized for a meeting a breeze . -also , it 's a great way to archive emails in a way that allows you to see them and organize them as you wish . you can empty your in box and at the same time keep a record of important emails . well worth your time . -it is also tablet friendly if you use a tablet pc like i do . i love it for that use . there is a fantastic text recognition feature that works extremely well . if you use a tablet , this is a great feature . -as was with the earlier version , you can add voice content to your notes . that 's right , voice recorded messages can be added to your notes . too cool . before you buy , you might want to go to the microsoft site and download the trial version . you 'll be able to assess for yourself . i think you 'll be pleased . i fond it to be one of the best products for 'electronic file keeping ' that i 've used . for the price , it 's not a bad deal .
0	pinnacle studio can assist the amateur videographer in ... hold on ... let me start again . pinnacle studio can assist the amateur videographer in editing some fairly interesting ... dang it ! give me a few minutes here ... pinnacle studio can assist ... ( samuel l jackson-styled expletive ) ... how many times is this gon na happen ? start and stop ! start and stop ! enough already ! one more time . now , what was i saying ? oh , yeah ... pinnacle studio can assist the amateur videographer in editing some fairly interesting video ... if you can keep it up and running . got the idea ? just adding my voice to the chorus of those have experienced the frustration of the pinnacle products . this is a bargain-priced product for which you will pay the cost of long hours of irritation and heart-pounding races to meet project deadlines -despite the software malfunctions . after installing the program , installing the patches , uninstalling the program and patches and reinstalling the program and the patches , i am still experiencing too many crashes . if you intend to use this program to piece together a video of uncle morty 's birthday party , the family vacation or your neighbor 's kid 's bar mitzvah , the cost and the ease of this program may outweigh the annoyance of its aforementioned weakness . if , however , your video projects fit under the category of `` job description , '' then i suggest spending the money for adobe premiere
0	i had to upgrade to ms works 7.0 due to y2k issues . i am not nearly as satisfied with ms wortks 7.0 as i was with ms works 4.5 . i am now searching for a replacement
0	the only redeeming quality about this gps system is that it 's cheap . i used it on a 1,000 mile trip on the east coast the week after i got it . the navigation is poor . i found that i often had to look over to the laptop screen because i was `` off route '' so often due to the poor maps . the system repeated the same annoying problems that i see in other feedback . 1 ) the unit would show me being off the road even though i was on an interstate . in this case it would continually recalculate the route and diretc me to take exits to get off the highway and circle around . 2 ) it directed me to make turns onto one-way streets in the wrong direction . 3 ) it could not locate a poi that turned out to be a few hundred yards away 4 ) it often did not know the correct side of the road for my destination 5 ) it does n't provide a chime when it 's time for a turn . it will tell you the turn is a half-mile ahead , but that might be the last time you hear an instruction . 6 ) in one case , it got me to my destination ( at least close enough ) but could n't guide me back to my starting point . the gps receiver seemed to acquire and hold the satellite signal well . but the maps are poor , as is the verbal instruction - it sounds like a 1980 's computer generated voice . if you 're looking for a trustworthy guide in unfamiliar areas - this is n't it . this is going back asap .
0	this software suite promises to do everything on earth , but does n't tell us how . there is no useful help file . there are no tutorials or instructions on the website . and , nero 's support is a joke ( just try to get a message through ) . i do n't understand how a company that started out with the best burn program in the game has sunk to this
1	ms put office 2007 on a dvd rather than a cd so there is only one disk , so they make the installation easier right off the bat . unlike all previous versions of office , you do not have to get into the details of what options you want . in previous versions , if you did n't make sure you installed all the features , when you went to do a function that was n't installed , you had to dig out your office disks and install the feature . a huge pain , but not anymore . the installation is hands down the easiest of all versions of office . you do n't have to tell it manually where to find your files . you do n't have to manually put in your favorite buttons . it 's all done for you . yes it takes some getting use to the new layout of the functions , but once you figure them out , it is so nice and smooth . this version is light years better than all previous versions . the most impressive part of the installation is outlook 2007 . in all previous versions , you had to export and import all your files and contacts . anyone who experienced this , knows that it never went that smooth . sometimes it was awful and you lost emails and contacts in the transfer , and the time it took to do this , was very painful . this is not the case with outlook 2007 . just load the program and it does all the transfers from your previous version of outlook . you do n't have to do a thing , and you 're up and running without missing a beat when the program is done loading . you will be shocked how simple it is . anything new has it 's growing pains to learn , but once you do , you will be very glad you made the change
0	complete waste of money . i purchased my copy at wal-mart but wanted to warn others before they made the same mistake i did . the graphics and templates they use on the package to lure you in are nice and tasteful . the actaul program is so not like that . the graphics are down right cheesy , and low budget . having only paid $ 9 for this program , i feel like i was completely ripped off . i 'll for sure be calling the company and asking for a refund . 1 star seems like too many to give this awful item
1	i love this product . i had a sample version of it prior to that expired , and i needed to have the full edition . it came in a timely fashion as well . i am very pleased
0	i hate this product . since i 'm used to office 2003 ( at work ) , opening this program and having to look at the childish-looking menu bar was a shock . the layout is irritating , poorly designed , and does not provide sufficient features . to make things worse , this sorry program does not allow you to save files directly to cd . the one-star rating was too generous .
0	unfortunately , i had to return the product because it was defective . the first disk failed to load to my computer . i contacted punch technical staff and they were unable to help me with the problem . i tried on another computer in the house , and the same thing happened . i therefore returned the product
1	i trust the information i find from britannica and so invested in the 2007 britannica ultimate reference suite . it has something for everyone . i use it side by side with microsoft encarta and together i get a more complete subject review . i prefer the content of britannica but for ease of use encarta is still superior . i look forward to britannica making the interface and ease of use better in future productions and that is why i am only able to award 4 stars
1	registry mechanic is a great registry tool . it works better than the registry tools included with symantec system works . if you purchase this version at 5.1 you can get a free upgrade to the latest version 6.0 once you register the product . try the evaluation and you will see how many registry errors your machine may have that can effect its performance
1	actually , comic book creator lets you use your content in a million different ways , including reselling of your work . the only limitation is that you ca n't sell comics created around branded content -- like images from marvel , paramount , tokyopop , etc. -- because they do n't allow that . it 's all in the user agreement . check it out
1	this is a good computer bible , but for the money , i prefer a program like amg bible essentials which has the libronix library system built-in and can be integrated with other bible study software . for about $ 15 more the amg program has both kjv , apocrypha and nasb , including a lot of other capability , like greek translations , word study , exegesis , parallel bible comparisons , etc . the rainbow bible is an older issue and shows its age by not offering features as mentioned above . some benefits of this bible include both niv and kjv translations , color maps , matthew henry 's commentary , naves and a version of foxe 's book of martyrs . the various colors can be distracting at times , but overall it is worth considering , particularly if you like the niv
1	absolutely love this program . i 'd been using norton for years and so was initially hesitant to switch . its not as user friendly as norton and has the annoying habit of repeatedly asking for permission even after it has been granted . on the upside this feature adds to its efficiency and gives the user complete control over all internet activity , making it an exceptionally good security program .
1	there are complaints about win xp sp2 being too expensive or complaints about technical problems . it is too expensive , but it is the standard at so many companies , big and small , around the world . i just wanted to say that anyone who gives windows xp sp2 a one star rating really does n't understand much about the windows operating system , and therefore you should not take into consideration their uneducated opinion about operating systems in general . the price is a bit high , but windows is what it is ... a dominant operating system
1	encarta users will have no problem using and enjoying the newest version of encarta - 2007 it is just as informative as the last versions with a lot of extra kicks , like the newest videos . recommend at least 1 gb of ram and a pentium 4 processor with a newer video card ( 2 yrs or better ) for the best video viewing it will run on older system
0	the program does a great job in figuring my taxes . but now intuit is charging for filing and the state program . also i was unable to download the updates over my dial-up connection . i called to have a cd version mailed to me but so far i have n't received it . i 'm trying tax act this year . it is a free program and has free filing . if i can complete the turbotax version i will see if i can duplicate my return using tax act . if so then good bye turbotax
0	do not order this . tech support from broderbund is basically non-existant . one sorry product
0	office 97 was a pretty good product . the programs were powerful , had a decent interface ( maybe not as good as the claris products of the early 1990s , but not bad ) , and came with a ton of features all on one disc . the office 98 release for mac was pretty much the same thing . the only thing that really got annoying for me was the office assistant ( paperclip ) but it is easy enough to turn off . office 2000 was a bit of a disappointment for me . i felt that the improvements were minimal ( aside from a bit more stability in word -- anyone who has ever used word 97 on a regular basis knows it 's prone to crashing ) and in fact detracted from the ease of use . one example is the clip gallery , which went from being one of the best organizers ever created to becoming a program that would n't have received decent reviews in 1988 . another is powerpoint 's outline feature . i always turned this off because it ate up monitor space and therefore made the actual slide smaller . when you use smaller displays like i often do this is a problem . the menus , which hide some functions until you go to the bottom of them , were also an annoyance . the manual went from being a nice thick book to one half the size . office 2003 continues making the program uglier . now there are many tasks crammed onto one little panel on the right of the screen . again , this eats into the workspace . the clip art system is even more cumbersome , and many of the clips are online only now . the help feature tries to point too much in the online direction as well . now some people may not complain , but what if you 're using a laptop in the middle of the country ? i feel that the program is basically an uglier version of the same thing that was first seen in 1997 . in fact , the 1997 version was more pleasant to work with and almost as powerful . on my macs , i 've switched to keynote for presentations and pages for some of my word processing because the new office versions on that platform are similar . some of the templates also look very 1997 . apple 's programs are updated on a regular basis , and their templates look very modern . now i know microsoft adds some new ones now and then , but they should consider redesigning many of them -- such as replacing the overused arial and times new roman fonts with something a little more classy . the program is bloated way too heavily . i can run office 2000 comfortably on a 486 with sub-1gb hard drive , but ca n't even get 2003 on it . a final gripe is that access is not user friendly at all . file maker is a better alternative , as it is easier to use and friendlier
1	this new nancy drew game was fun to play ! it was shipped on time and arrived in good condition .
0	do n't waste your time and money ! ! extremely poor product support ! 60 day return policy which they exploit by trying to solve your problems and delaying past the 60 day limit , then you 're stuck with worthless software . i installed it on my computer making a complete backup of it . then my computer crashed and i lost everything . i thought i was covered since i just made a full backup on an external hard disk but when i tried to do a restore norton ghost would n't recognize my external hard disk . i spent a full day with their support people and he finally gave up telling me he had to send the problem to the next level of support and that they would call me within 48 hours . nobody called ! i bought their extended download service and tried to download the product again . it did n't work and after spending 8 hours online and on the phone i still have n't got a working copy . the product key they said i needed and i tried to use also does n't work . i 'm writing my credit card company next to try and get a credit but i expect the same result - no credit back and software that does n't do what norton said it would do
0	based on lots of great reviews , i decided to buy kaspersky . after two months , i got a message saying my activation key was blacklisted . i sent an email to customer service and got an auto reply saying they were too busy to respond within 48 hours . finally after three days someone got back to me and told me to try deleting and reentering the key . this did not work . i had to reply again to customer service and got the same auto reply . this time , no one ever replied . i sent another email threatening to write negative reviews of them and they still , weeks later , have not replied . i emphatically advise against buying this product . if you ever have a problem , you will not get help
1	this is a good package for backing up your pc . fairly intuitive , although it took me a couple tries to figure out what the software was doing so i could select the right stuff to backup . it uses good compression to minimize the amount of disk for your backup . the downside of that is you ca n't just select a file to restore , you must go through the restore process . you can select a single file , but it takes a bit of time . runs automatically and unobtrusively so it wo n't interfere with your current work .
0	this software never worked after installation using the cd i bought it ask me to extend my preview `` your preview using this feature has expired to continue using purchase the full version today '' i have tried to contact the seller in vain . this is very unfortunite for such people to continue hacking customers money with under rated product
1	it would be nice if the contents were listed , with all of microsoft 's versions , it gets confusing
1	i bought finale songwriter to make lead sheets with chord symbols . it worked well for my project . i have no complaints .
0	this program sucks . i used it last year and thought that it was unwieldy and really confusing ( i.e . unlike turbotax and other programs , there 's very little transparency in the system ) . then i bought it again this year because the store that i went to was out of turbotax , and i needed to get my taxes done quickly . this year was even worse than last year - not only was it still unwieldy and irritating , but it gave me figures that simply did not make sense . the results for the federal return were ok , but it gave me figures that would have cost me over $ 2,000 in taxes that i did not owe on my state return . i ended up going online to double check my results using a cheap ( $ 10 ) online service recommended by the ny state tax website . within 45 minutes , i cleared the online source , and got results that made far more sense . i have no idea what happened with taxcut , but i suspect that they may have been missing a field somewhere along the line - this is a problem that has been noted by a number of others in reviews on a variety of sites . i will not be buying this product again
1	we purchased this for my 6 year old son and 7 year old daughter since both children have been asking me to help teach them how to play chess the last several months . while i have been able to get them started , i find that approach used in this software to introduce the game pieces and concepts has allowed their understanding of the game to grow . both kids enjoy using this software and , if i would let them , would spend hours at a time using the software . my biggest issue with the software is the sound and animation . we continually have issues with the sound/animation not being in sync or the audio cutting in and out . we run this on a computer with plenty of processing power , memory , disk space , etc . it does not bother this kids too much , but i find it annoying . all in all , a great tool to help my children learn the game .
0	the first version of easy cd creator i used was cd creator 4 basic . it was okay , pretty much what it said it was : basic . i got the upgrade to that from an ebay auction and it worked pretty good . later due to lack of support by the manufacturer for new cdrw drives in good old version 4 , i upgraded to cd creator 5 platinum ( the version being sold here . ) this too worked pretty good - for a little while . then the operation was moved over from adaptec to roxio , and from that point onward , things have been more thorny than rosy . roxio will require you to register the product in order to download the ( one ) utterly essential update to keep this thing running . perhaps you do n't mind that , but i feel it 's a somewhat minor invasion of privacy . plus you have to keep track of your password to the website and if you change isp 's you will have to re-register . a hassle to say the least . also , since roxio took the reins , there are no further updates being provided . instead roxio tries to `` encourage '' ( read `` browbeat '' ) you into getting the software upgrade for even more money . this upgrade will not work on win98se , which i still use for various reasons . so if i were to upgrade the software again , i would also have to spend the extra money for a new operating system with all the faults and foibles that can introduce with other apps that i need and still use . if you have money to burn along with all those shiny round coasters you are going to be making , i applaud you . i prefer to keep a little cash for retirement . it is difficult if not impossible to get support from any real carbon-based life form , and the website gives little or no support for some of the issues you may face , such as getting `` illegal request '' errors from direct cd , or inability to format or erase cdrw 's that was once possible in version 4 . also , any cdrw 's created in version 4 may not be readable with the new software , or at the least there are some technical issues with this . at any rate , it is not neccessarily all that `` easy '' unless you are fairly technically inclined and understand ( or are willing to learn ) some of the finer technical points in cd recording technology . i prefer not to be bothered with it , i just want to create some cds . i now find that some functions do not work appropriately at all , especially direct cd , a program that originally provided the ability to do `` drag and drop '' writing of files to a read/write cd . now i find that direct cd is non-functional , and the only cd 's i can write are cdr 's , and there are problems growing in that area as well . speed of the cdrw or brand of the recording media does not seem to be the issue . the software simply refuses to work as it once did . it should n't be called `` easy cd creator '' . perhaps `` irritating '' cd creator would be more appropriate . in summary : this does not deserve stars . perhaps a few `` black holes '' ? while i once would have given wholehearted supported this product , regrettably i can not support it with the same enthusiasm now .
0	the graphics are clear , but they are bad ! horses look nothing like that and it is really gross ! i would say get it for the younger kids , because they wo n't care . there is nothing to do with the game except earn money , build your hotel , and keep your horse from getting sick . you do n't get to ride that often because it said `` you have ridden enough for this round '' and it is very enoying . you ca n't pay enough monay to keep more than one horse , but you need to jump them to earn money so you can build your hotel / parking lot / jumping corse / breeding paddock / ect . but you ca n't do that unless you can jump the horse alot , and you ca n't . it is easy to go 'bankrupt ' so i would say this game is not for little kids because of the money dealing . not for older kids because of the dumbness of the horses look , not for younger kids because of the money problems . so do n't get this game
0	i 've been a loyal user of systemworks ( also `` utilities '' antivirus ) for many years , frequently buying upgrades as i moved through various windows oss . the latest verison ( 2006 ) has been a big disappointment . 1 ) the `` integrator '' repeatedly crashes ( and `` must shut down '' ) . i was told to reintall ( it took 4 hours ) . tech support ( email ) was slow and barely intelligible . 2 ) the full scan now takes over 8 hours on a modest sized system . 3 ) the utilities have not been substantially improved in 5 years 4 ) the rebate ( for upgrade users ) came in the form of a debit card , not a check . ( what a hassle ! i do n't want any more `` plastic '' ! ) 5 ) turning the norton protection off substantially speeds up my pc . what the heck is going on back there ? during the next year , i 'll be looking for a new anti-virus support product . cheers , joh
0	once i figured this software out , i was able to do a slideshow of my pictures , integrate video , and produce a decent dvd . only problem is , it distorts all my video footage by forcing it into 4:3 whereas my dvd camcorder shoots in 16:9 . this sucks . i have been buying other software packages ever since trying to get my video to stay in 16:9 . roxio support did e-mail me back with the blanket statement that it does n't support 16:9 at this time . even in the new 7.5 version . roxio needs to join the rest of us in 2005 and bring their software to be compatible in widescreen
0	card studio 2007 has repeated many cards from card studio 2006 . i bought this new program to have more of a selection but was very disappointed . also is is very difficult to see the cards when they are bunched . you have to pick a card in order to read the front . very time consuming
1	i really enjoy using this program , much better than what was out there 5 - 10 years ago when i last worked on genealogy . i love the ancestry.com feature , it is wonderful to go find your grandparents , great-grandparents and even great-great grandparents in the us census . i have found out a few things that i did n't know , unfortunately my mother recently passed away , and i have no one to verify some of it with . i would suggest that anyone contemplating this program gets it now , and starts working while you still have elders who can help you sort through the information you find . i also found a family tree out there from someone who only lives a few blocks from where we used to live . she has traced her family back to the 1500 's in germany ... and it appears that they are related to us . it was strange to go to her website and find a picture of my great grandparents headstone . it was just another branch of the family . buy it
1	purchased this edition of taxcut last week . on win xp2 the software installed cleanly and it downloaded the updates without any issues . i imported last year 's data in less than a minute and i had my return completed in less than 1 hour . this includes capital gains/losses , dividends , and amt calculations . it does n't get much easier than this . yes , you have to download updates . the irs is still making changes to the tax codes long after this software has to be packaged and sent to the stores . the alternative would be to download the whole package online when you buy it , but would n't that take at least as long
1	this program is positively wonderful for word practice and pronunciation with a number of flash-card style game and a very elegant listen-record-replay interface . while the two characters do pronounce words slightly differently , hearing those variations really helps to understand the phonetics in a way that a single voice would lack . however , this really is more of a companion tool for a more traditional course . i purchased this with `` colloquial icelandic '' and would definitely recommend purchasing them together . there are some extremely strange spelling/pronunciation variations and without having a written explanation of these things , you may be left staring in great confusion as the characters read phrases on screen -- `` hva '' is pronounced `` kwah ? '' what ? having `` colluquial icelandic '' to turn to for explanation helped a great deal . that package has two audio cds of alphabet , number , vocabulary and conversation exercises with a very well-written 370 page coursebook . i gave this product a 5-star rating as it is superb for its intended purpose , but it does not stand alone as a complete course
1	purchased this to help navigate a trip from northern michigan to south-west florida and back again . we took a fair amount of side trips and having this on our laptop made it easy to get to where we wanted to go . there were a couple of times that we went `` off route '' but were back on route in very little time . it helped us decide where to stop for fuel , eat and sleep . up-to-date information is available with an internet connection and the larger map-viewing area was greatly appreciated . well worth the price . highly recommended to others
0	when i first installed the program i was able to access the images , but since that first time i have n't . my operating system is xp and i do n't know if that is the problem with the software . i have since then uninstalled it . i did not think this product was very easy to use
1	july 27 , 2005 why have n't i heard about the mia characters before ? i bought this for my god daughters 6th birthday without knowing anything about the game . we opened it together and i was blown away with the 3d animation-the same quality as pixar . everyone at the party was glued to the computer screen in this adventure land game . best of all , its educational but because it was so entertaininng , my god-daughter has not stopped playing it . well worth your money ! i 'm going to buy the rest of the mia series
1	i have had my computer for a couple of years now , and i have always wondered if there was ever a product out there to help me rid my computer of waste . well this product was recommended to me by a family member , and i am impressed as to how well it does ! ! i have never had so much success with one all-in-one product as i have the system mechanic 6 professional , and the fact that it came with virus protection was and added bonus for me too . if your computer is slower than slow i definately recommend that you use this product to get rid of the unnecessary junk on your system , and keep up to date with the latest viruses out there . i do n't think i will ever go back to mccafee again !
0	i purchased this updated version 1/5/07 . it does not print correctly , and technical support assured me that the developer is `` working on the problem '' and a `` fix '' is soon to come . this is march 1 , and no update is available yet . this program is un-usable and i am very unhappy and would not recommend `` as is '' to anyone . i have the 2005 edition and was very pleased with it . this is a large embarrassment to the hallmark company
1	ok , it is big ( 4 cdrs ) . and a full install will require over 2.35 gb . but it loads quickly and offers nice greeting card variety along with pretty sophisticated card customization options on all pages of the card . as in previous years , it also installs event planner . if you do n't want to use event planner you can stop it from starting with windows by going to start / all programs / startup group and deleting the entry for event planner from the startup group but if you do n't have a similar program , you might find event planner to be useful . i found setting up this program for my auto-duplexing ricoh color laser printer easy enough to do , so setting it up for other printers will likely be pretty easy also . the quality of the printed cards is really astounding , even my normally `` picky '' wife thinks they look very nice and acceptable for any use . i suppose your results could depend on your printer but if your printer currently prints nice graphics and pictures , then the cards should turn out very nice . i recommend using heavy card stock for a professional looking final product . cards that default to printing out in the 1/4 sheet size ( four fold ) format can easily be printed at 1/2 fold size and the graphics and text remain outstanding . i never experimented with the `` partial install '' that would require disk swapping but save hd space , so i can not if that would be a nuisance or not . overall , there is nothing i 've found about the program that i do n't like .
1	i have been a long time user of delorme products but decided to get a combination of microsoft products both for the us and europe ( autotrip ) . the program loaded very smoothly , but do make sure you load the program before plugging in the gps locator . there are multiple warnings about this as well as what to do if you do n't follow directions . i loaded all the data on my laptop so i would not have to carry the dvd . the setup was also quite simple . there are warnings about usage in an automobile that pop up in use ( as well as the cautions during setup ) . one needs to keep this in mind and not be distracted when driving . i set the mapping program and forget it . but it works best with two people in the car with one to navigate . the gps locator has a great chipset . very , very sensitive and quickly finds the coordinates within seconds , even as i sit in my house . it rarely loses a lock on the satellite . the route finding works well , so far . you can save your track as well as the route , but unlike the delorme products you ca n't playback your track ( or if you can , i have not found it ) . the screen is pleasing and you go fullscreen . i have n't tried voice recognition but the spoken commands are about average . the ability ot overlay satellite photographs when planning routes with an internet connection is a plus . plus you can routinely update road construction sites . so far , no opinion on how good that feature is . the microsoft location finder internet leaves something to be desired though i 've only tried it at home . it routinely thinks i 'm in china ( which is interesting because so many ads are quite able to figure out where i am ) . the gps also works with other programs by selecting a generic nema gps . there are other optional equipment to go with the gps . if you 've never used a gps mapping program with a laptop , microsoft s is a good choice . just do n't be surprised if the gps lcates you accurately and the microsoft locator product puts you on the other side of the planet .
0	i have always used norton products , and upgraded to is 2007 when my subscription came up for renewal . what a mistake . my computer freezes up all the time , and the software is difficult to use- it is not at all straightforward like previous versions of internet security . do not buy this product .
0	this is the first time i have ever reviewed a product and i do it so that no one else will waste their money on this . it adds virtually nothing to xp . too bad they did n't make it as interesting as their packaged media edition . that would have been worth the money , but old bill who does n't want to be the richest man in the world would rather you spend money on a new pc to get that product . the themes are nice but far too few for the price . the games are a gimmick since you have to pay to play the real things . the dj is dumb and the dancers are cute but after a while boring . hard to figure out how to use the music converter and photo stuff . too bad could have been something but in its present form , not worth the money
1	a great bargain - you get full office professional , vp and full version of windows for under $ 300 dollars . after waiting for months and months for office 2004 professional to be released , when it finally came out i was ecstatic . one problem : vp 7.0 would n't install on my g5 , only on my laptop . i called microsoft support and within minutes they told me that they were working on a patch for machines with over 2.0 gb of ram . i downloaded the update a week later when it came out and everything is now golden . the moral of the story is that microsoft underestimates the needs of mac users because they are used to wimpy pcs that have no ram
1	i was afraid at first not to order directly from adobe but decided to take the cheaper route . it was obviously worth it - everything arrived perfectly - wrapped up , original cd set , etc . shipped in record time as well . eyal
0	this computer system , although almost universally accepted , can be beaten in quality and flexibility by an operating system that can be downloaded for free , such as the fedora project ( a distribution of linux , a os which can be changed by anyone for free ) , or bought from software company supporting these open source project with unlimited customer support for around ï¿½50 ( $ 90 ) or less
0	i was extremely disappointed in this `` upgrade '' . i had roxio 's easy cd creator 5 and loved it . that product allowed you to easily arrange your music on the dics , burn it , then create a lable or insert for the disc with almost no effort . almost everything was intuitive . creator 7 is a big step back in ease of use and utility . so they added a few new bells and whistles , so what ? the base use of this product is to make music cd 's and to create inserts . arranging music is not as easy as it was before . and the insert creator is so frustrating to use i do n't bother . in fact , i have continued to use creator 5 and have simply written off the fact i paid $ 100 for creator 7 - for nothing ! now , with a computer upgrade , creator 5 no longer works . i do n't dare try another roxio product ( just read the reviews for 7.5 and that appears to be a total waste of money ) . i 'll be taking my chances on anything else . . . not roxio
1	this is going to be a great program that will benefit our family in producing fantastic photos and films
0	i do n't have a problem with the software . it pretty much does what we need but reversing an error can be a nightmare . before i start this tirade , i should point out that the customer service reps were very nice . but they do n't have the infrastructure to provide the most basic level of service ( please , read on ) . the customer support system for the payroll upgrade on this product is really scary . ( 1 ) they want to have access to your checking account to pay for the annual payroll subscription ! ! ( 2 ) they do not send receipts ! ! i help with the books for a small non-profit and paid for the payroll subscription on my own credit card . the only receipt i could get was a copy of the invoice , which is not formatted to print correctly on an hp1200 ( duh ! ! ) . what is really disturbing is that these people are supposed to be accounting experts ! if you acquiesce to the checking account withdrawal , the only receipt you receive is the line item on your bank statement . have they every heard of a `` paper trail '' . well you sure wo n't get one if you purchase the payroll subscription for this product . i will start looking for an alternative to intuit because they obviously do n't understand some basic accounting and auditing principles .
1	i 've used paperport 9 for about 3 years , currently running under win xp . i love it , my wife loves it , i have bought it for my kids , and recommend it to others . a lawyer friend of mine raves about it . i 've had no problems with it . ( i had to downlaod and install an upgrade , but more recent production probably has the upgrade already incorporated . ) i download bank and credit card statements and other documents to it from the internet ; i store faxed documents in it ; i scan checks before i deposit them ; i use it to convert documents to pdf so i can e-mail them . the only reason i did n't give it 5 stars is that i wish it were more convenient to do a couple of things ; maybe v. 10 adds those features , but for the money , v.9 is a bargain . i just wish i had a faster scanner ( what do you expect for $ 60 ? ) so i could get rid of more paper documents . highly recommended as a start toward the paperless office
1	i decided to get this office suite after using it recently . i 've usually worked on office 97 and 2000 , but the 2003 version has some pretty cool features not found in the older versions . the feature that i really enjoy is the pivot report feature in ms access , which was n't in ms access 2000 . this is a truly great reporting feature . you can now use access as a front-end to slice and dice data stored on data warehouses in oracle , sql server , sybase and other enterprise-type databases . if you 're used to creating crosstab reports , you 'll definitely like the pivot report feature . crosstabs are limited to 2 dimensions but there 's no limitation on the number of dimensions in pivot report . to me , the main drawback is the price . ( i did get mine at around $ 370 at j , which is a great price . ) i figure i can upgrade this in about 5 years time , which works out to about $ 70 to $ 75 per year ( assuming that i 'll be paying about $ 370 to upgrade in 5 years time . ) a big positive is that this is the industry standard . so the work you put into learning the multiple new features of word , excel , ms access is not wasted because you can reuse the same skills in another job . your time will be well spent . note that the software may seem bloated but the intelligent user is able to choose and pick the most useful and relevant features of each application and ignore the features that are not useful . different features are useful to different people ... another positive : each product in office professional is fully programmable using visual basic for applications ( vba ) which you can use to build custom programs . this very powerful feature is sometimes overlooked when shopping for office suites .
1	i only installed the product two days ago and have not really been able to give it a solid workout . that said , my initial take is very positive . as a writer and lousy typist , i think it will increase my productivity expotentially . i look forward to really getting into the nuts and bolts of the product very soon
1	i have been using microsoft operating systems for a very long time , and , i still say that this is the best system out there , for many reasons . an increasing amount of linux and mac users have made the claim that they are more compatible with programs , and are less vulnerable to virus and hacks . in response to linux users- stay away from linux , linux is free for a reason . it is compatible with very very few programs as it is , and that number will only decrease . for gamers - rarley do i see a linux compatible game . just stay away from this system . for mac users- mac 's also have a lesser amount of compatible programs . fewer and fewer programs can run on them , and like linux , that number will only decrease . the only thing keeping macintosh alive is itunes . which is compatible with windows . besides , when direct x 10 comes out , it will only be available for windows , making macintosh 's un-usable for new games when the next windows os comes out ( microsoft vista ) . the computers are also generally more expensive than windows . btw - you can get viruses on mac 's
1	i thought that i could never learn piano on my own . all the material that i ever looked into either did n't have enough information in it or was too complicated for its own good . because of this software , i am constantly learning new things , and slowly improving my skills as a future pianist . if you are a beginner , you want to buy this software . it 's done wonders for me
1	switched from panda anti-virus to this one . great software , very sensitive settings . it was quite aggrevating at first getting constantly interrupted in other programs to be told of various things going on . finally got each feature individually adjusted to settings i can live with , and it works great . they could improve the filtration time ( long ) to analyze your computer ( i only have a 40gig hd with about 20gig used ) as it takes about 20-25 mins . to do the complete cleansing process . however , first time i ran it after having run panda for the last time , it caught 2 undetected trojans panda missed . it also isolated a hidden file trying to access the internet for `` updates '' that i still have not been able to identify , but it 's zapped . overall , best i 've seen so far , and you can install it on up to 3 computers from one cd ( just name each installation with a different username to accomplish , all perfectly legal with the 3 user cd deal ) . i have 3 laptops covered at a cost of about $ 13 each - i 'll take that all day long
0	there 's a reason why this stuff is significantly discounted . this is definitely one of the worst products i have ever bought . i did not do much research . i think the data may be in there , but i could not learn how to make it work . the interface is horrific - unusable . do n't do it
1	this product did an excellent job of figuring our taxes . this is the first time we 've tried something like this and found it very easy to follow and complete . you can go back and change things or review them , it gives you a way to e-file , you can print out all the copies that you may need . i was surprised how easy it was to use . however it took us a long time because we read all the items very carefully and double checked everything but it saved us a lot of money from what we used to pay our tax preparer . i was very happy with it
0	i rarely write reviews but i decided to write this since i had this urge to let everyone know that this product is just plain bad . the review by `` reviewer : rc lansing mich '' has listed all of my frustrations and i will not go over them again . but the rating of 4 stars that he has given does not agree with what you will read in his review . the summary of this product is that it is `` highly unusable '' . you will be tired of using this on your first trip that you will not feel like every using it again . yes , you can `` manage '' you way with this product . however it is not worth your time and money . and last point that struck a nerve with me about the ols maps database ... the company came out with a plan where customers can send them updated maps , based on locations they have travelled , not covered by the original map database ... come on !
1	i recently wrote a review for this item due to a launching issue . very angry , i made numerous calls and emails to nova . at last i was able to converse with a rep who was more than helpful and made right with all my issues . i am pleased with my outcome with nova and the response , making sure i was a satisfied customer . i only rate this 4 stars as i am just now using the program and am very excited with what i 've been able to accomplish in the past 3 days . thank you nova for your help
1	i have had .mac for years and enjoyed using its functions . i have a number of photo pages hosted as well as some iweb sites . plus i use it for syncing and backup , etc . i am not a power user , however . but it 's a great utility and particularly when you have other family members who you want to have access it some of its features easily .
1	i am so satisfied with this trendmicro security system , that i highly recommend it to everyone . without mentioning my previous system , this is tops ! i have never felt so secure before getting this system . thank you for being able to supply me with it . i hope through word of mouth and mail , that i have caused others to go for it . i do know of 3 people at least who are changing . thank you again
0	i 've used paperport for years mostly because it was the best of a bunch of poor options . however , version 11 is buggier than earlier versions : every time i launch a microsoft office product , the paperport installer starts up . there is no reference to this in the paperport help file or in the ridiculously inadequate knowledgebase on the paperport site . another bug imprints a `` trial copy '' legend on your pdf files . this one is explained in the knowledgebase , but requires you to tinker with the registry to correct it . that 's a bit ridiculous . why are they distributing code with a known bug ? nuance expects you to pay $ 9.95 for e-mail technical support - even if it 's a bug in their own product . the product is a modest performer at best , but nuance 's awful technical support policies are the real sinker here . i 've requested an rma for a refund . jerr
0	purchased this software because i got a deal with a special price break . i have a very small business , so a purchase of several hundred dollars needs to pay back quickly . the set up took a lot longer than i had anticipated . the customer service was no help - could n't answer my questions . i ended up spending 6 hours to get everything right - another day wasted . i 've got myself stuck with this now and will use for a few months since i 've spent the money , but i 'm going to look for alternatives in the meantime . if this is `` quick books , '' i need to find `` lightning fast '' books somewhere
1	i currently have version 1.0 on my pc . it does everything it claims to and does it flawlessly . it cleans internet cache , history , cookies and more ! i 've tried another internet privacy program , but it failed to clean up the tracks that this program successfully cleaned . i especially like the fact that it cleans the autocomplete entries in my internet search and internet browser . others can use my pc , and wo n't be able to see what documents i 've recently opened , which programs i 've recently run , or what i 've searched for and what sites i 've visited online . and that 's the way it should be ! this program can be set to clean up this information securely ( can be set to wipe not just delete the info ) . another plus , it can clean usage tracks for all users on a pc . the program i tried on my other pc only worked with administrator accounts ( and not very well may i ad )
1	i would recommand this software to anyone that burns dvd/cd . it is user friendly and easy to navigate
1	coreldraw was my first foray into vector graphics back when version 3 showed up on my desk at the small `` mom and pop '' screenprinting shop i worked at . back then , corel came with oodles of free fonts , clipart , manuals ... not to mention free technical support via a toll-free number . i stayed with corel exclusively until version 10 ... enduring countless patches , bugs and the dreaded `` odd-numbered '' curse ( if you tried version 5 or 7 , you feel my pain ) . adobe photoshop was always my photo-editing program of choice ... corelphotopaint just never quite `` did it '' for me . industry demands eventually delegated that i delve into adobe illustrator . being already familiar with adobe photoshop 's features , tools and `` look and feel '' , illustrator did n't present a huge , overbearing learning curve . in illustrator , i found the same robust features as coreldraw ... which was n't what impressed me about illustrator . adobe 's intuitive programs , and their ability to interact with one another ... seamlessly ... that is what won me over to illustrator . illustrator 's ability to edit/create pdf 's in their native format ? wow ! exporting layered vector files to photoshop ... with layers intact ? ? ? wow ! ! ! ( i could go on ) now , that being said ... there are still things that i prefer in coreldraw compared to illustrator . the extrude function in corel is much easier to utilize . the powerclip function is more user friendly than illustrator 's `` make clipping mask '' function . the ability to customize/edit/add shortcut keys is an amazing feature . ( again ... i could go on ) in regards to importing and exporting files from other applications , coreldraw wins , hands down . it boasts a robust set of import and export filters , my favorite being the .eps import filter which lets you import an .eps while converting the fonts to curves during the import . this is a must have if you work with an .eps file created on another computer whose fonts you lack . if i had a dollar for every .eps that pulls into illustrator with fonts blown out ... i 'd be independently wealthy . why illustrator has never implemented this is beyond me . so , to sum it up ... coreldraw is a great program ... but i ca n't imagine it being my only vector drawing program . just like in real life , you need a great team . this program , paired with adobe creative suite , meets my needs perfectly .
1	poser user since version 3 . poser continues to improve . more life-like , faster
0	far from user-friendly , you will be at the office later at night tearing out your hair trying to find the buttons on the tool bar for even the simplest of office tasks , wondering `` why did i get this program again ? '' its like reading another language after using previous editions of word , which i was a big fan of . i guess with some extensive getting used to the it might be nice but for now it 's a nuisance . i ca n't find anything on this toold bar that looks like an airplane cockpit . in the words of thoreau `` simplify . '' good luck sending files as attachments to colleagues-they wo n't be able to view the newere version . get used to saving in `` 97-2003 word format . '' also , wo n't comply with other programs such as e-fax unless saved in this manner . at this price , you could do without the headache .
0	i purchased this program for my personal and home business tax return but it did not include all the forms needed so i had to buy another version from them . h taxcut included all i needed and was 1/2 the price
1	in general ... this program worked very well . i 've had a hard time putting my new dual core pentium d computer in the raid 1 configuration , so i bought this instead . the clone function works extremely well and is an adequate alternative to the raid 1 configuration , but i was a bit confused about how to use the `` incremental backup '' function . the initial backup went well , but when i went back for incremental backup additions , it would tell me it was `` impossible '' ... .so i just clone the c drive every few weeks now . i have two seagate 320 gb sata hard drives , and it 's great to know that i have an exact copy of the c drive if i fry it . i live in ethiopia , so the power fluctuations are frequent and disastorous . i 've already lost one hard drive to power flux abnormalities . i 'd buy this product again , and it 's comforting to know that it 's on my system and that i can back up my valuable data easily and quickly when i need to
0	office 2007 may seem ok at first . the menus are all ok for me to use , so i do n't have to build menus from scratch . but after installing the trial , i found numerous complaints that would make me want to trash it if i had it . 1 ) word does n't want to integrate with outlook very well 2 ) everytime i want to send a mail message i accidentally click on 'paste ' 3 ) the flags and categories for outlook are annoying and just add to the time spent administering email without helping me more than outlook 2003 4 ) along with all of the other microsoft products i 've tried in the past month , it hangs , corrupts its own files , and generally takes up too much memory . i 'll stick with office 2003 , which does n't have nearly as many flaws . there is no reason for me to upgrade . i 'm also back to ie6 , money 2006 , and will not upgrade to vista . i 've lost volumes of emails because i ca n't downgrade my outlook files . good job in alienating your customers , microsoft . ( so what 's new ?
0	this maybe the worst interface i have ever had the displeasure of working with and that includes console applications with dos interfaces . edlin and fdisk are more user friendly than the mcafee 's security center . there is noway to disable the software except by uninstalling the program or opening xp 's admin tools and then forcing the services to stop , which is not a recommenable approach for the average user . here is a short list of the probelms that i encountered . counter spy is cheaper , easier to use and has an interface that is user friendly ! * can not select to disable during non-internet use so i can run software that security center has conflicts with like protools 7.3 recording software . * the scan results are vague , ie returns 6 quarantined threats but does n't display what the threats are and you ca n't print the result either . * there are more ... ... there are some good features but the detractors win by a land slide .
0	the benefits may be great , but the exercises are so boring that it is way too much effort to do them on a regular basis
1	this product is a very simple to use , extremely efficient tool . i am very pleased with results it produced for me
0	why buy iolo system mechanic when you can get malware for free ? i installed pro 7 and it gave many , many problems . iolo did not respond to my emails so i uninstalled . their uninstaller did not work either
0	ok ! being the richest human being on the planet called earth , bill gates decided that he 's not wealthy enough . so he released this microsoft office 2003 , which i really think is not much different from previous edition . the price is , as usual , very expensive . what 's worse is that bill gates decided all the pre-installed windows in new laptops and desktops come with the trial version . so mere mortals like us need to spend extra big money buying the full version to simply do some basic documents . i can see bill gates , being a deified bloodsucker , using $ 100 dollar bills as toilet paper , and laughing at us who work their butt off just to make enough money to live . so shame on you bill gates and microsoft
1	this is a wonderful and very useful program , not only for school age kids but also for adults . it is full of useful information . it comes very handy when you want to learn about anything . look for any topic , you will find it there
0	the program works fine on windows xp and is easy to use . it lets you print cards of many sizes . the big disappointment is in the number of cards that comes with the program . the back of the box claims `` 4500+ cards and sentiments , celebrate life 's special moments with cards for all occasions '' . that 's nice . the problem with that is that i counted the total number of cards that come with the program . it only adds up to 1045 ! so where are the other 3450+ cards and sentiments ? are you supposed to design them yourself ? i just do n't know . and certainly `` cards for all occasions '' means just that , does n't it ? well there 's lots of birthday cards and plenty of holiday cards but not one sympathy card of any kind . i guess you just need to buy those on your own
1	i purchased panda internet security 2007 for two reasons : the price after rebates ( free ) and the fact that it is a 3-user license . after switching from mcafee to norton ( and a subsequent 1-year renewal ) i decided to either buy pc-cillin 2007 or try panda . ( 39.99 or free ... hmm ... ) i installed panda on my laptop first ( after uninstalling norton internet security 2005 ) . no problem what-so-ever . in the initial hdd scan , panda found and cleaned 5 files that were found in my email inbox identified as a worm . i then installed panda on 2 desktop machines with no problems there either . panda found 3 traces of spyware on one machine and nothing on the second . panda boots up with windows xp quickly . it has only given me a couple of pop-up messages ( one for a wifi intrusion , which was another computer on my network ... i accepted it and it never came back . the other pop-up was to start on-line customer service or something like that ... i declined it and it has yet to come back . ) my laptop is a p4 1.8ghz , 1gb ram , 32mb ati video , 40gb hdd . the initial virus scan took less than 20 minutes , scanning over 250,000 files . not bad ! desktop 1 's first scan ( p4 2.4ghz , 512mb , 128mb video , 120gb hdd ) scanned nearly 300,000 files also under 20 minutes . desktop 2 was the quickest ( p4 3.4ghz , 1gb , 128mb video , 80gb hdd ) scanning over 330,000 files in about 15 minutes . i am extremely impressed with panda internet security 2007 . it 's everything i hoped it would be . i would definitely recommend this product to others
0	if you use microsoft office ( word , excel ) do n't buy it ! links to your previous .pdf simply do n't work . adobe knows about it , but have no viable work around . stick with prevous versions .
0	if i could give it 0 star , i would . my humble opinion is that kaspersky is not better than norton at slowing down your computer . one brand new computer , plenty of space and memory . one old computer but with plenty of space and memory as well . each time kaspersky updates , i ca n't open outlook express nor explorer . well , the programs do open actually but i have time to vacuum and dust before they 're launched . i used the repair fonction and uninstalled and reinstalled without any improvement . samwis
0	buyer beware . if you encounter a technical issue with this product and require a refund , you 're out of luck . they will send you in endless circles attempting to get a product refund . there are many other good products out there that do the same thing . it 's really easy to purchase , but impossible to get a refund
0	what a terrible upgrade . i 'm going to uninstall it and go back to 6 . even though i specifically told it to leave my file associations alone , it changed every one of them . it 's a nightmare . i 'm still trying to get nero disassociated with certain file types , to no avail . the backup program is awful , slow and much more difficult to use than the one built into 6 . overall , ultra 6 is a much better product . i 'm going to uninstall 7 and send it back to nero with instructions on where they can associate it
0	i received the package and read the instructions . in retrospect there were hints buried there that indicated this may not go well . it did not . my installation stalled out and would not complete rendering the computer useless . i had to take it to a professional to get it going . even so , i have had problems with internet explorer stopping suddenly , bsod 's . this is not a job for the average computer user
0	i trusted that this software would do what it claimed to do and was so let down by its lack of performance that i am dumbfounded and left speechless . during backup process i selected about 15gb of info to backup , spanning 4 dvds . everything looked fine , except for two ( 2 ) simple errors that i received , indicating that those related files may not have been copied/backed up properly . i figured no big deal , 2 files/errors out 15gb , i could handle that . based upon the false pretenses that my critical info was backed up properly ( simple pictures , videos , mp3 files and financial files to include previous years tax files ) , i then proceeded to slick my drive . remember , only 2 simple , benign and almost inconspicuous errors during the backup process . everything looked great . during the restore process , i then received numerous errors , each of them requiring me to click 'yes ' when asked if i wanted to proceed . i got tired of clicking yes around the 100 or so mark and decided to click no . when you click 'no ' , everything is undone ; there is no 'ignore all ' function so i had to sit through every prompt and got tired of it and decided that proceeding with 1000 files and answering yes would involve too much pain for me . i then selected a smaller group of files to have restored , only the 'my documents ' folder but ran into the same situation . eventually i ran a test on a small folder to have restored and still ran into the errors but pressed through . hardly any of the files were received error free and those that had issues were never restored . my guess is approximately 2/3 or 3/4 of my files were not restored and of course none that really mattered made it . i had the latest update applied to the program , so that should not be the cause . i would have done better to slick my entire hard drive without going through the backup process as i would have been at nearly the same place but without experiencing all the headaches , frustrations and an investment of hours , no days of my time . the program has been recently purchased by microsoft for inclusion in the vista os , i imagine . it will do well as a microsoft product , as it fails to deliver upon its promises
1	i have used ms works from about the time it was born , when it was quite primitive and sometimes unstable . but i have continued to use it , primarily for databases , because it has become progressively more stable and easy to use . these are not all small and simple databases -- many include several thousand items , each with 20 to 30 fields of data . it is easy to `` find '' single items or to assemble groups of items ( `` filter '' ) , and to print customized reports . so if you do n't need ( or want ) the super sophistication of access , i have found works to be a friendly and helpful -- and inexpensive -- alternative
1	at first i had some difficulty adjusting to the new interface . once i got used to it though i find it a lot more useful and comfortable to operate . it 's a great step forward in all senses for acrobat ! !
0	i was very disappointed with this program . but i was also thinking it would be more comprehensive and include more than just basic words and phrases . even so , the male and female guides in the program often pronounce the words slightly different which can be frustrating . i learned more icelandic ( along with correct pronounciations ) while in iceland than i did with this program . and besides , anyone under the age of 50 in iceland speaks english
1	my dad got this for me to supplement a latin textbook i have been studying for my high school language course . it is quick and easily understandable . you get plenty of words and phrases , which is perfect for a traveler . if you want to learn the language for the sake of knowing it , not travel , however , you 'd better get a book to supplement this . it does n't teach about pluralization , verb conjugation , or other oddities that the language holds , such as , in latin , the ending -m which implies a direct object . the latin cd also does not use the dashes over the vowels ( ie . , , , , ) . overall , i am very happy with the product and with the price of $ 39.99 ( usd ) , but i am also quite glad i have my textbook ( ecce romani ) to go with it
0	i 've been a digital artist for 5 years and always loved and supported paintshoppro and corel products . i have to say i am very disappointed in the new version , pspxi . no problems with the download , but the program crashes easily , you can not drag and drop as fast as in 9 , basically is slower in everything you do . i am a photographer , and looked forward to the new photo features , which work , but for panoramas and complicated work others than one photo forget it . just hangs up and so slow you could go have dinner in between . i have searched the net and support wise , the upgrades and patches have not helped . corel is not solving the problem and maybe they ca n't . this is not a pc problem which they so want us to believe . i have plenty of memory and speed on my pc . it may be something involving how the xi stores it 's cache . not sure . but the changes are not workable , sadly . i think there are some corrupt files or driver problems that corel desparately needs to fix and supply us with , or they will find themselves out of the ps market . this is not just me talking , it has happened to alot of loyal fans . because it could be the better than photoshop if they fix it . if you really want the program , download the free trial first and or try the x or 9 version , especially if your pc is an older model .
0	this is my first public review of any product . i generally dont have the time or motivation to go throught the process of posting a review . however , i have never had such a negative experience with a commercially available software package before . from beginning to end , the process of repeated attempts to install and then trying to remove nis2007 was time-consuming , frustrating , and crippled my computer . first the operating environment details . i 'm running xp-pro sp2 on a 2.6ghz pentium with 1gb of ram . upon the de-installation of the existing nis 2006 and spyware doctor applications , i proceeded with the installation of nis 2007 . the installation appeared to go cleanly , but upon attempting to restart , my computer hung on shutting down , and upon attempting to come up , i got a blank desktop with no task bar , start menu , or desktop icons . later , as i was working with symantec support and was able to get a desktop back , i also experienced things as not being able to bring up the control panel or click on the 'my computer ' icon . of course , i had no internet access during the whole ordeal . since i couldnt find any phone number contact in the ridiculously minimal instruction manual that came with the package , i called my local isp to find out what they knew about the affects of using nis 2007 . through them i got a phone number for symantec support . as a side note , the manual points out ways to get support if you have access to the internet and email , but gives no direction if you dont have access to those . over the course of the next 4 days of working through my issues with nis 2007 , my experience with symantec support left me with the impression that they were mostly incompetent and quite innefective . i give symantec credit for having 24/7 phone support , and i did work with one knowledgable support person there named jay , but most of the experience was frustrating and time-consuming . the help desk is located in india , and the first problem is that they couldnt hear me though i was speaking loudly . the next problem is that i had to answer the same questions repeatedly as if the person didnt understand my answers . on a number of ocassions , i felt the person on the other end was just going through a script , and wasnt listening to what i was saying or reading my growing case notes . i got passed around a lot to different people and spent a lot of time on hold . they kept trying to get me off the phone even though we hadnt worked through the problem completely . in one instance , the helpdesk person was trying to tell me that things were all fixed even when i had told her there was an activation error during the re-install we were working on . having worked with tech support and edited registries , and tinkered with start-up configurations and various services settings , i could never get nis 2007 to install ( tried four times ) . trying to un-install the package turned out to be almost as difficult and troublesome . uninstalling has left me with problems with my computer i have yet to work out . i still cant use my scanner because it complains about a symantec dll issue . i have no idea why that would be . anyway , i would rate this product less than zero if i could . there was nothing that went right , and a lot that went wrong . i cant believe symantec could put out such a pathetic piece of software with such inffective support . i 'm returning nis 2007 and trying my luck with zone alarm .
1	this is my second version/upgrade . it is very easy to use and i sought it out when upgrading my previous version . love it
0	this software did n't quite do what i expected . i was somewhat disappointed when i discovered that it would n't convert itunes m4p music files to mp3 files to run on a real player .
1	i tried an inexpensive program first and found it just did n't work . this program has been fantastic !
1	this thing is amazing.. my plasma is like a whole new tv.. my 60 '' sony sxrd paired with a ps3 is the best looking picture i have ever seen , after using the stv100 . this is a must have
0	in installed this product on a dell optiplex gx110 ( admittedly not the latest , but still a very standard machine ) running windows 2000 with 512mb of memory . in spite of spending literally hours with the software i was unable to get it to produce an outline or dimensioning of a wall being drawn by dragging the mouse , as clearly illustrated in the accompanying video . without this feature it is virtually impossible to efficienctly produce exterior or interior walls . multiple emails to broderbund have produced autoreplies suggesting that i refer to their website for help . this site is essentially worthless for all but the most fundamental problems ( like not being able to read the install cd ) . it would also appear that this product is picky about the hardware it supports and also the version of driver . be prepared for possible frustrations with this product , with little support from the manufacturer . i can not report on other features of the software because i was never able to produce even the walls of a structure
1	i remember the first time i used wordperfect , and the first time i used microsoft word . i could n't imagine why anyone would choose the vastly inferior word over wordperfect . years passed , and now i find myself using ms word every day . i 'd been ground down by the thousands of word users who 'd picked it up along with powerpoint and excel , and who did n't have enough savvy to know how to convert documents from one format to another . wordperfect _always_ converted msword docs . msword never reciprocated . should n't that have told them which program had a mandate to make the customer 's life that much easier ? with each successive iteration , wordperfect introduced some new innovation , and in the next incarnation , microsoft aped it . it got to the point where users would nod appreciatively at the innovation , then wait the inevitable year-long interval for microsoft to catch up , and then they 'd buy that . well , due to an outrageously fair price point and multiuser license , i tried wordperfect x3 , and it was like coming home . it 's nothing short of amazing . i went out and bought a copy for my parents , and they love it , too . now my brother , an attorney , has asked me to buy him a copy , since so many of the federal prosecutors he works with have wordperfect only , and ca n't seem to open his word files . the more things change , the more they stay the same
0	this program works after it 's installed , but the installation process is unbelievably flawed . if you have a version of norton on your computer already , this may cause all kinds of problems with the new installation . not only did i have to uninstall all versions ( after norton lets you install the new one ) , but i had to make a bunch of changes to windows , also . on top of that , while you 're struggling to install ( i got it on to one computer easily , a second with some difficulty , and the third ... well , it 's been several days of struggle ) , norton counts down the number of days in the subscription . so if you install on one computer today , and another two months later , then your subscription on all your machines still expires a year from now . i do n't see how symantec can put out a program that does n't allow you to upgrade easily ... after all these years , they ca n't fix this major bug ? that 's just pathetic
1	i bought this program for my 11 yr old granddaughter and she has very quickly learned the keyboard . i wanted her to learn the correct way to type before she developed bad hunt and peck habits . so much homework now requires typed reports . she had fun with it . it 's a great program !
1	this is probably one of the most outstanding and rewarding software programs that i can ever remember purchasing . i never learned how to type , so i reserved myself from many computer projects/reports , email responses and business related aspects due to this 'achilles heel ' . well , i researched this software and found that it has come a long way from earlier versions and decided it 's time to give it a try . i even bought a plantronics cs55 - usb wireless headset from the get go to give this software a real workout . let me tell you , my pessimism was definitely challenged because the software worked extremely good about 20 minutes after opening the box and browsing the tutorial . i was talking sentences and watched it appear on my monitor within seconds . i speeded up my speach as if talking in a normal conversation with someone and this software just kept spitting it on-screen . amazing ! ! ! ! do n't get me wrong . there are occasional misspellings to deal with but your user profile keeps getting updated everytime you use it and prevents the same mistakes from occuring the next time . it begins to gain more and more accuracy . salvation has been found as far as i 'm concerned . p.s . i began running the program with win xp - 512mb ram and it performed very well . i just upped to 2 gigs ram . most everyone in forums recommends at least 1 gig ram . i did this review in about 1 min . and had only two misspells .
0	if i could give less than 1 star for any trend micro product i would . it gives too many false positives when you do n't even have a virus . you are going nuts trying to find where the virus is and there is not even one there as trend told you there was . avoid this like the plague and save your hard earned money . it 's a piece of crap .
1	i bought this package because my daughter needed to be able to do word processing and make presentations for school . i used it because its what is being used at my office . i wish they had included frontpage instead of one note ( which i really have n't been able to find a use for ) . otherwise , it works the same as other ms office packages i 've used in the past
0	if you spend a good deal of your time doing ocr on books skip this program . it is even slower than the previous version ( which was tortoise-like ) still screws up the order of columns , is very bad at reading mixed numbers and letters , takes forever to move through long documents , and just genreally makes you feel like you are back to using a 486 when you are working on a pentium 4 . oh , and do n't be fooled by the claim that it can actually create fillable forms . it will take you less time to create it from scratch in word than to scan it in and then fix all the errors . i 'm switching to kurzweil
1	i own hallmark card studio 2006 , and this product is a different , interesting addition to greeting-card-making . it has lots of kinds of pictures , i.e. , aquatic mammals/fish , etc , for making `` fun '' children 's cards
1	i have been using omnipage for several years at my law office and found that the ocr with this version is impeccable . i frequently scan and ocr newspaper and magazine articles . they are multi-column and the magazine articles typically have graphics and tables or charts . when i convert them into word documents i seldom get any formating errors . in fact , because the ocr is so good i have set up a batch process to run at night to ocr all the day 's work so my computer resoiurces are n't being taxed when i am in the office working . way to go nuance
1	i have read several reviews and decided the spyder2pro would be a good monitor color calibrator for me . i have a samsung 970p monitor with all adjustments via software . the calibration process is very simple and all you have to do is follow the menu of questions during the calibration process . i like the spyder2pro and would recommend it highly .
0	i was thoroughly disappointed . the first few words i looked up in the thesaurus were not listed -- words like upholstery ! when i went online to see what i might be able to glean from their online site , first fogware had not sent me a coupon , then i had to deal with bad customer service ( i am not doing business with any companies anymore that give bad support ) then after i finally got the coupon code they had left out of my box , the online info is exactly what we have in the cd -- so save your money and do not subscribe to their extended services site unless you need a spanish online dictionary also ! very bad ! i am now going to go buy roget 's and check it out
1	the product is easy to use . like how it intergrates with ms office applications . it 's been a great tool for providing documents to my clients
0	i just purchased the top end dell dimension xps ( with the 10,000 rpm harddrive ) but i still have to allow about 10 seconds for the initial program startup , then it seems to hang for 15 to 20 seconds after that . i usually just go get a cup of coffee when i start act and when i come back we are ready to roll . i also reboot my system every time i close act . the system just seems to run better without any `` lingering '' remnants of the program in memory . whenever i delete a contact the program locks up . it has done this through several versions . i simply reboot , restart act and it works fine . at some point act changed the date on many ( hundreds ) of my activities to 11/18/2004 . now i manually type the date into the call , to do , meeting and note fields to avoid this problem in the future . i have been an act customer since the early dos days . i have a huge commitment to the program in that much of my important data is now stored here ( and some of it is nowhere else ) . it is so difficult to export `` all the data '' ( including notes , history , etc ) that i am basically trapped . my point is , a program like this is not one that you can easily bail out of like word or excel , which has some alternatives available which will read your current files . a lot of the act ! database is proprietary and while you can purchase a conversion program from a few vendors , it is not a cheap proposition to do so
0	after over a year and a half including renewing for updates i 've now discarded norton sw 2006. it was problamatic and a waste of money . it conflicts with partition magic another symantec product and will not work with many ms updates . my system is now operating trouble free since i 've uninstalled nsw . previously my computer was eratic and crashed frquently
0	i bought this product to assist in recovery , but i tried to recover a program and it would not work . does real well on a complete recovery but do not expect a partial . works well on recovery of my stuff
1	easy to install and navigate . automatic incremental backups are completed randomly . sometimes they work , other times they abort . ca n't determine why
0	summary : i wasted a lot of time trying to make this work , and i eventually went back to other products . in theory , integrating virus checker , firewall , spyware , and data backup into a unified suite ( like ms office with word , excel , powerpoint ) makes sense . however , this software package seems poorly made ; it did not work very well for me . hardware , os , primary software used : 1 . dell lattitude d620 laptop with 2gb ram , windows xp , ms office 2 . dell x1 laptop ( thin/lightweight ) with 2gb ram , windows xp , ms office 3 . dell dimension desktop with 4 gb ram , windows xp , children 's games prior virus/spyware products : lattitude x1 : norton dimension : freeware provided by our isp theory : since microsoft makes the os office applications that get infected with viruses , their product should be better integrated with the os . there will be synergy by integrating several related software applications . lesson : well , after a series of terrible experiences , i hope others will benefit from my wasted time : 1 . instead of loading most of the program from the cd downloading small updates , this seems to load only a small part of the program and downloads huge files . this made me feel that the product was shipped unfinished . you had to do this separately for each machine since it hides the downloaded files then deletes them prior to finishing the installation . this took a better part of an afternoon . 2 . i purchased a 3-pack license . installing and activating the software on the 2nd 3rd machines required a series of very annoying steps that involved logging into their website with broken links . it finally required a phone call . at least , the phone support experience was good . 3 . the product promises to minimize performance impact , and improve overall performance . on the lattitude dimension ( powerful machines ) , there was no difference in performance , but we could notice a slightly slower performance with the x1 . this was later verified when we uninstalled the ms windows onecare and replaced it with another product . 4 . the product has difficulty updating . it opens a small message box that asks you to click to update onecare , but that takes you to a webpage that only works about 1 in 4 times . 5 . except for the first time , data backup always has several errors that i have to manually fix . this has very rarely happened with other data backup software i 've used . 6 . some applications , the firewall asks everytime for permission to connect to the internet although the application is in the list to always allow this connection .
1	i use corel draw x3 everyday for designing logos signs for my sign company . i can start from scratch and produce professional designs in a minimum amount of time . this program offers a wide variety of editing tools , great import/exporting options , photo editing and tracing options . the more i use this program , the more impressed i get
1	( responding to joel g 's review below ) it 's unfortunate that your child was unable to enjoy didi ditto because of a technical problem you had with your computer . the majority of didi ditto players are running microsoft windows and enjoying this great educational software . if you send us an e-mail message at service @ kutoka.com , i am sure that someone from our technical support team will be able to help you resolve the issue you seem to have experienced with your computer display . also note that all activites can be unlocked in the activities menu by pressing the f6 key on your keyboard . a full list of the game 's keyboard shortcuts can be found in the user 's guide which is accessible from the start menu . hope this helps
0	i have gone through all the major revisions of paperport , and i dislike them all . the features have improved , but the program has become steadily more unreliable and bug-prone . it often crashes , which means i have to shut down the entire program when editing a document and restart , which apart from taking ages , loses all the changes i made . very frustrating . it has also become steadily slower as the version numbers have climbed - you just to sit around twiddling your thumbs waiting for it to load a document or advance a page on a scanned document , especially if it contains many pages . if you can find an alternative , do n't buy it - unfortunately for me , i can 's see any alternative if you want to manage scanned pdf files in a sophisticated way . incidentally , this product seems living proof of the dangers of bloatware - it 's pretty clear that the programmers have lost control of the software 's innnards . plus , by the way , support for this product is a scandal - $ 9.95 for each email sent ? unbelievable
1	product came in a timely manner and i love it . easy to use and fun too .
1	connecting the cables was so easy i was sure i must have missed something . recording the music is equally easy . removing the snap crackle and pop was a snap . my only confusion resulted in recording from 45rpms , i should have left them as stereo because it seems as though if you check off as mono , you can not remove the crackle and pop
