1	i used lexar media multi card reader in my p2120 fujitsu laptop via a usb 2 pc-card adapter . it 's truly plug-and-play without any need of drivers in windows xp
1	i received this product from an amazon.com seller for 1/2 the price of what best buy was selling it for . it was new and in an unopened box . upon opening the box i was able to tell right away that it was built very good . the hinges for the outer antenna sections are very sturdy and once locked in the open position were not going anywhere . i had spent over $ 300 for a runco antenna for my runco projector for local hd ( directv does not have local hd in my area ) and even with perfect mounting position outside was only getting at best 80 % reception with it . this antenna with a similar design the the runco model is built better and i get between 94-98 % reception depending on the channel ( directional antenna so reception varies slightly ) . i was also amazed with the fact that i not only get local channels for youngstown ohio , but i also get locals with over 60 % reception from cleveland ( direction antenna is facing ) but also pittsburgh ( which is on opposite side of house about 60 miles away and in opposite direction antenna is facing ) . great product and no issues with it so far . the included booster works better than the one built into my directv receiver , so i advise hooking antenna up straight to your ant in on the back of your projector ( if it has a built in hd tuner ) or tv for best results
0	i 've had this phone for approx . 9 months now , maybe longer ... and i truly do n't know how i 've stood using this dual phone system for so long . however , tonight i 've taken a giant step `` upward '' towards better quality and design with the panasonic kx-tg 5432m dual system . this dual handset is the worst i 've ever experienced in a cordless system . from the moment i set it up , the static has been atrocious . step away from the base unit over ten feet and it sounds like someone gargling gravel or a mad cat hissing in your ear . i ca n't even step into my attached garage to talk with someone without major static to the point of not even being able to be heard by the other person . even within six feet of the base i receive intermittent static that becomes obnoxious and distracting , not only to me , but to the other person on the other end ... for they hear it too . i will never purchase another uniden product , if this is the non-quality of product they put out . i had a 2.4 mhz system that would outshine this system ... and i wish i 'd never gotten rid of it . as the title says ... if you desire a lot of static when you talk on a phone , this is the system you need to bring that crackling symphony of music to your ear . the melodic consistancy this system creates in ones enjoyment of talking on the phone will not put you to sleep , but rather increase your aggravation of dealing with what sounds like a major electrical storm going on inside your head . uniden should be ashamed of this product . stepping down from the soapbox now..
1	i recently bought one of these for our 18-month-old son . the piano arrived in fine shape . the piano and bench are sturdy and well made when you put them together properly . the sound is just like i remember a toy piano should sound . notes are not perfectly in tune like a fine instrument , but tuned within reason to the notes of the scale , including sharps and flats . most importantly , our little boy just loves playing this piano . hopefully it will inspire him to continue and so it is as great an introdroduction to music as any other toy , including the electronic toys , we have purchased for him . i also liked that he was n't able to pull off the keys try as he may . they just kind of become locked when he trys to do that and can be put back in place by minor adjstment .
0	about three years ago , maybe four , i bought two lexar cfii cards . one never worked , the other worked , but lost all data . i wrote to lexar , that i had two bad cards , they sent me one new card of the same size . i gave that to my girlfriend told her to only use it on pix she did n't care about losing . i still have my card , in a ziplock . none of the file removal programs will get the images off , i 've used all of them , had their ( file removal ) tech help give up . in this day age of `` just make the item '' i am upset . but you take your chances . do you want the only picture of your great grand-mother lost because you used a lexar ? i would n't , i use an actual sandisk card , myself . if they ever ( lexar ) made it right , i may have written a better review , but they have n't . so that tells me that they do n't care . how important are your pictures to you ? frederic
1	i was about to retire an old standalone dvd recorder , because it would no longer let me create menus or finalize discs . i bought this lens cleaner and -- voila ! -- the recorder is working again . super easy to use ( it 's simply a dvd that you insert into your machine , and the menus tell you what to do ) . highly recommended
0	i think the most frustrating thing about a fax machine , is when you put your four or five page fax into the feeder , and the machine sucks two or three sheets at once ruining your whole fax ! i especially got this machine because i thought it was a quality machine , and would n't do that , but i was wrong . sometimes this machine sucks more than one sheet at a time which is very frustrating . i would stay away . it prints nicely , but it does n't help if it ruins your faxes . i see other reviewers have the same problem
0	i bought 2 of these drives to set up a raid1 array ( mirror ) and one of them continuously has errors , causing the array to be degraded . i called tech support and they said these drives do not support raid . big let down , i have to go for the server version which will end up costing much more
0	i was very disappointed in the lexmark p450 printer . the colors were very dull and the picture quality were definitely not up to the lexmark standards that i am used to . ( i have several lexmark products ) i returned the printer
1	what an amazing product for such a small price . it works right out of the box , but to get full functionality you need to install the encolsed drivers . the option of mouse or pen makes it useful for everyday pc work as well using the pen for graphics . i use it mainly for teaching via phone and use the whiteboard in messenger to communicate in words and pictures . it really makes a difference . the unit seems well made and i like the fact you can personalise the tablet to add a picture of your choice . i opted for the smallest in the range for value , and was not disappointed , but i am sure for more commerical use or for artwork a much bigger screen would be better , but at cost . the software bundle is ok too if you do n't already have photoshop tools . the one quibble is that at home when i installed the drivers it continued to crash my pc with my wireless keyboard installed . not ideal , but as i dont use it at home any longer it is not a problem for me , but be careful , i am sure there will be a fix somewher
0	everything works fine except for two flaws in excel : on the numpad , the minus key actually toggles shift and the slash key acts as the alt key . this is unacceptable , i had a logitech keyboard also with all sorts of annoying little flaws which surfaced when playing games . logitech has some great ideas and sleek looking products , but they are plagued with small yet crucial technical shortcomings . i will never buy logitech again
1	my dad and i installed it in just an hour ! it was very . you ca n't beat this price . i found the same mount at best buy for over $ 200 ! ! !
1	i 've had this device for two years . just today i sent it through the wash cycle of my laundry ( not on purpose ) . the thing still works ! ! i will not , however , try sending it into the dryer though beause i 'm pretty sure that would fry this thing
0	i ordered this on the recommendation of another amazon customer . i wasnt impressed . i though this would save me money because until then i had been just buying new copies of my favorite cds that were scrathced up . i cleaned a few discs and ran them through all three `` processes '' without successful results . it didnt seem to make much difference with any of my discs . i dont think this is a good `` repairer '' of any disc thats more than mildly scratched . my suggestion would be to just replace your damaged discs by buying another copy of your cd or dvd on amazon ! ! many of my cds i have replaced for $ 7-10 bucks on here . i wish i wouldve kept my $ 25
1	mouse is comfortable to use , and i have n't had any problems with it so far . i did have some difficulty hooking it up to my computer , but once i figured out the problem it was all smooth sailing from there . it is my first wireless mouse , so i have nothing else to compare it to , but i definitely like it a lot better than my old mouse .
1	this is the perfect little tv/dvd for a little girl 's room ! the picture is great and hello kitty pops on screen for certain commands ( volume , channel change.. ) . my daughter age 4 loves it . i would have given this product 5 stars but there are a couple drawbacks ... the remote control is has so many buttons and they are very tiny , very close together . i can barely read what each button does because the labels/print is also very tiny . this is annoying when in my daughter 's darkened room and i have to turn on a bright light just to find the pause button ... the other thing i have to point out that bugs me is that you ca n't eject/or open the dvd player unless the tv is in dvd mode . in other words when i go to put in a dvd , i ca n't just push `` open '' . nothing will happen . you have to find the right button , choose `` dvd '' from a choice of 3-4 things , and only then will the tray slide open . all in all , these things would not prevent me from buying this tv again ... although it would be nice if they did come out w/ a more kid friendly remote with bigger buttons/symbols for a small child to recognize ... one great thing i want to point out -- there is fast forward scan that you can watch as it fast forwards ( something not all dvd players offer ) and this is great when you are putting a dvd in for your child and they want to skip all those pre-movie ads ... .you can ff right to the beginning of the movie ! ! !
1	use canon ink with you canon printer and you 'll have no problems , just excellent pictures
1	excellent product - very ergonomic , easy to set up and use ! wireless works great . i would recommend this product
0	i purchased this product and could n't get it to work on a pc , laptop , or pda ( cingular 8125 ) . not only does it not register in any sd/minisd card reader , but the craftsmanship appears to be suspect as well . i am currently pursuing a refund
1	this was a great buy , item was as described . a++++++++++
0	hello , i purchased the avic-d2 , xm and the ipod kit from amazon . i then went to my local installer and confirmed with them that they could install all three devices and still allow my factory rear entertainment center to function in the new setup . after 3.5 hours they failed . i decided that i 'd return the items because i needed to get an alternative gift before christmas and i did n't have time to find another way to get it installed . i was able to return the d2 , but the gex-p10xmt and the ib100ii are not returnable . it turns out that amazon brokered my sale to three other companies that have differing return policies . had i realized that amazon would sell me something that i ca n't return i would have purchased elsewhere . at this point i will never purchase anything else from amazon ever again
0	i just bought these matte labels . when i printed a photo , i noticed that photos come out at the ultra lowest quality , and the worst part is that everything printed on these labels smudge when fingers are lightly run over the labels . has anyone experienced this ? please share your story
1	this is simply the best remote you will ever need for all your infarad remotes ! i have a chinese satallite receiver that i could never get it to work with all other `` universal '' remotes . i was able to teach this remote to work with it ! this is a small computer
1	bag is attractive and very sturdy . the computer fits securely and is well padded . i recently used it on a trip and was able to place other carry on items in it and it traveled well
0	the pros : -you can reposition the product as many times as you like to get the best fit without it losing it 's adhesive . -it allows you to use with any type of arm band or car dock because it fits so well . -does n't prohibit any functions of the ipod ( i.e . sensitivity of the wheel is just as good with the shield on ) the cons : -bubbles , bubbles , bubbles . i 've carefully applied and re-applied this product no less than 20 times in a variety of different ways , and it leaves numerous bubbles on the ipod everytime , especially on the screen . -if the screen is not lit up , all you can see is bubbles on the screen . -it does n't do the ipod justice , because it looks so cheap when applied . -after 2 days with this product i 'm already looking to replace it .
1	the best sound i 've ever heard in a radio . i also own a cambridge soundworks 730 and a bose wave cd/radio . despite the fact that this is a mono radio , its sound is incredible accurate , warm and powerful . the bass is astounding and the highs crystal clear . i agree with a report i 've read in cnet that states this is probably the best sounding radio ever made .
1	i purchased this item on march 15 from amazon . we 've been using it for almost a month now . my wife and i have built our ht system in our master bedroom ( 16x14x10 ) also have 40 '' samsung lcd 4095 ( 1080p ) and polk audio speakers ( in ceiling ) lc60i for front and middle speakers and rc60i for the surround speakers . i 'm awaiting for toshiba hd-xa2 that was recently ordered to complement our system and would be replacing my current infinity subwoofer with a hsu stf-2 sub . originally my first choice was a pioneer vsx-1016 receiver but with lack of zone 2 and hdmi video pass-thru only . i did n't think it fit our needs . however , onkyo tx-sr604b not only was a true bargain but it also exceeded my expectations , ease of use ( very easy setup ) user friendly powerful enough to drive all my polk speakers clean and crisp sound . i did'nt have any problem as far as clicking sound related to hdmi issues like few folks have mentioned on their reviews and i did n't mind running extra component cable to my tv knowing it does n't up-convert component to hdmi . the only thing that i have n't tested it yet was the zone 2 feature . i 'm planning to install my extra pair rc60i in wall speakers to our master bathroom hopefully soon so ca n't comment on that part yet . overall we 're very pleased with our purchased thanks amazon !
0	nothing that uses fw400 responds to being plugged into this device , whether is it bus powered or not . bloody useles
0	i found this paper on amazon as an accessory to the olympus camedia p-400 printer . this paper does not fit the p-400 because this paper is too wide . thus , with the p-400 , this paper is useless
1	after installing the card , i booted up my windows xp and it locked up . after rebooting again , however , the card worked fine and has continued to work fine . i 've only had the card for two days , and so far i am very happy with it . here 's my setup : windows xp home edition , direct tv set-top box , and a standard cable from the set-top box into the card . since the set-top box is in the other room , i 'm just using the set-top box remote to set it on the right channel . a little tedious , but it 's fine for recording a few shows . i have n't tried the remote that came with the card ( i assume it does n't work through walls ) . the wintv 2000 software is not very user friendly , but i have n't found any bugs in it yet . i chose not to install the software and drivers from the cd . instead , i downloaded all of the latest versions directly from the manufacturer 's web site
0	i would never buy this tv again or a samsung product for that matter . i obviously purchased a lemon , have had two different service calls to come out and try to fix it with no luck . samsung initially told me i would get an exchange but then got hung up on and when i called back i was told my two service calls only count as one because they were in a 30 day period . how 's that for sound logic . i really like it when it works , but , unfortunately , an important aspect of a tv is that you can expect to turn on when you press the power button .
0	i 've been using this remote since it was released . better than any others i 've run into , but when it gets a glitch which all software driven devices are susceptible too , be prepared to give up a couple of hours . when it 's working , it 's a 5 star device , however ... read on as to why i give it a 2 . as i type this , my hold time is up to 45 minutes on the phone to 2nd level support . 3rd call today . i simply got a new pvr . programmed ok , but it is n't the default device when i watch tv . also , it took two calls to find out my directv pvr is not a pvr , it 's a `` satellite '' . as a `` pvr '' , it could n't be added to activities because `` you do n't have a device that will change channels '' . news to me . never known a pvr that could n't change channels . literally , 4 friggin ' hours so far and it still not right . at some point , the tv suddenly stopped turning on . 2-3 hours on that issue and it 's still not right . tv does not go on until i hit the `` help '' button on the remote . to add insult to injury , i ca n't access the website . enter my email as an id and am told it 's already in the database . i ask for a password reminder via email and get a message that my email address is not recognized . i hate that the software does n't have a simple `` home '' button . you have to go through several menus to get back to it . hold time now up to 52 minutes . i have to hang up for an appt. , so the hold has to be repeated ... .again . oh yeah ... i also dislike the size of the buttons , especially the numbers . cell phone sized . no doubt designed for a dainty child . i could go on , but if another comes out with a product like this one , i 'll be looking hard at it
0	i live in san francisco and have generally good radio reception . this unit could not receive normal fm stations that table radios sitting right next to it could pick up ... and i used the fancy `` dipole '' antenna on the boston accoustics unit and the other table radios only had an internal antenna . the hd part of the radio is total junk . sometimes the audio `` skips '' and sometimes the signal is lost and reacquired ( meaning 3 or 4 second drop-outs . ) all in all , there 's nothing good about this radio . do n't buy it .
1	i love this arm band . i have had it for about 6 months now . you dont have to take your ipod out of the arm band to charge it or to hook it up to your computer . i also only use my ipod for the gym , so its nice that this arm band provides great protection ( better than ipod 's armbands because it fits snugly and wont scratch it when you put it on ) as well as not coming off while working out .
1	excellent value -- these batteries are just as good as name brands for about half the price . if you use a lot of aa 's , this is the way to go -- made especially nice if you use them as a filler to get your shipping free on your entire order if it is hovering in the $ 18 range
1	title : intuos3 tablet publisher : wacom publish date : unknown isbn/model # : ptz631w reviewer : robert saucier rating : 5 stars in 1997 , after buying a new top-of-the-line 450mhz pentium ii system , i splurged on a wacom artz ii tablet . oh , my ! pressure-sensitive , tilt-sensing , pointer control , assignable function pads ; it was heaven . after a couple of years , every time i tried to use it with my primary graphics application , my computer would spontaneously reboot -- a bit counter-productive . i watched for new drivers and new versions of my application but , as technology marched on , my beloved tablet and graphics application continued their spats . sadly , i disconnected the tablet and gently packed it away . lately , i 've been feeling the pull once more , that urge to use a pen to do photo touch-ups instead of my mouse . miraculously , a wacom intuos3 6-inch by 11-inch tablet dropped , almost literally , into my lap . sleek , gun-metal gray , sexy -- with a comfort-grip pen ( much like my coveted pilot g2 pens ) and a mouse ! even better , the intuos3 comes bundled with 3 applications that show off its capabilities : adobe elements 4.0 , corel painter essentials 3 , and nik color efex 2.0 le . heaven just got better ! the intuos3 has over 5000 lines per inch of resolution , over twice that of the wacom graphire product line , and , with its usb 2 connection , there 's more than enough communication bandwidth , meaning better tablet to application response . one hesitation i have when adding a new piece of hardware is in regard to what the driver will do to my system ; will it introduce instability or get along with everyone else . the intuos3 driver has been rock-solid in the two weeks that the tablet has been living with me . i 've used all of my `` usual '' programs and have had no problems at all . the tablet has also been peacefully co-existing with two external drives , a wireless desktop receiver , a card reader , a scanner , and a printer , all riding the same usb bus . the intuos3 has 8 `` chordable '' buttons , 4 at each side of the tablet , to which keys , macros , or other actions may be assigned . the default for each group are the usual alt , ctrl/command , and shift , along with `` space '' . the placement of the buttons allows you to keep a grip on the tablet , holding one or more of the buttons , while tapping whatever key on the keyboard with your pen hand . being chordable , you can hold any or all of the buttons down for those tricky shortcuts like alt-ctrl-s or to the side of each of the two button pads are touch strips which can be independently programmed as well . the default setting is to scroll or depending on the context . the ends of the strip , in keystroke mode , can be set to playback macros . the pen , with its 1024-level pressure-sensitive stylus and `` eraser , '' also has a duoswitch . the duoswitch 's two positions may also be programmed . the pen action is smooth with the default nylon nib -- there are different types of nibs to simulate different types of tactile feedback . with the ergonomic grip , the pen is extremely comfortable to hold . the 5-button mouse , designed to be used by either `` righties '' or `` lefties , '' is not as ergonomically correct but considering the versatility , this is more than acceptable . as with every other clickable/pressable feature associated with the intuos3 , the mouse buttons are programmable with a ridiculous number of options , although i 've yet to find the `` fix photo , '' `` illustrate article , '' or even the `` design website '' settings . i can see only two very minor changes that i would make to this fantastic product . i would love to see the ability to add weight to the pen . it is just a bit too light for my personal tastes and considering how configurable the tablet is already , this feature would be the feather on the cap to me . the other change would be making the drawing surface transparent as it is on the graphire ( and was on the artz ii ) . sometimes , having the ability to trace an outline can save significant time . for the casual home user , i would recommend the graphire product line -- this intuos3 model 's srp of $ 369 may be a bit high where a $ 99 entry point on the graphire is more affordable . for the pro-consumer or professional , however , whether doing photo editing ( my primary use ) or illustration , the intuos3 line is well worth the investment . it 's great to be in heaven again ...
1	this is a surprisingly good radio at this price . it is small , compact and yet very robust and quite heavy . it is nothing like the cheapie plastic radios one sees in the drug store . here are three things i really liked about this product : 1 ) the am/fm reception is outstanding . i am in a bad area with few stations and this model gets them in clean and clear . listening to fm on my stereo headphones was a real pleasure . 2 ) the buttons and controls are easy to use and sensible in function . this is something sangean seems to get very well . 3 ) the multi-level display lighting can be turned off , or up in 3 steps from dull to very bright . a few things i did n't like . the pilot light for `` on '' is a like an intense blue laser and lights up the entire room at night . i had to put black electrical tape over it . the aux input is a mini-jack instead of rca connector . minor inconvenience here . and finally , the cabinet is nice wood , but the finish is not as good as i think it could be . this radio is a pleasure to use and it sounds better than i expected for this price . it 's a keeper
0	i 've purchased and attempted to install three of these adapters . one of them was on an older dell laptop , installed without any problems at all and connected seamlessly to a linksys wrt54g router with wap encryption . the problems really started showing when i tried to install the second and third adapters , both on desktop computers running windows xp sp2 . the software installation was a breeze , but when i plugged in the adapter - nothing happened . connect to network ... which network ? scan..who ? what ? it looks like this adapter has a very , very short range and does n't work very well a wall or two in between the routers . it would see the router and connect - to drop the connection and not find one . but then it would find it again , and on and off . never really worked as expected on the desktops , so i 've given up . i 've had to disconnect them and reconnect them multiple times . downloaded the updated software from belkin 's site , and still have connection issues with the desktops . the laptop works fine as long as i do n't take it one room away from the router . avoid at all costs please . i 've used other wireless devices with the same router that i 'm trying to connect and they work fine - a few rooms away and all . spend a few more dollars and get something worth the money spent . spend less time troubleshooting and more time surfing . good luck
0	this was my second netgear product i bought ( previously a wireless modem which i was only okay with not impressed ) the idea of a network storage appeals to me . but this drive just is not good . in reading the previous reviews i found that it was a finicky thing , and be careful on the drives you buy for it . well i searched and searched and found a drive that worked and bought both yesterday . tried to set it up today and connecting the drive went pretty well , but that is where everything started to go down hill . midway through the install it tells you to okay any error messages ( which turn out to be things like this is untested on xp and might not work kind of errors ) and suddenly my computer reboots . figured it would have told me it was going to do so oh well , and it never goes back to the install like most programs do when they require a reboot . tried again , same thing happens . started poking around and find out that not only do you have to check the drive you put in to the sc101 , you need to look in to your own computer . to quote netgears web site , `` scsi disk drivers from the promise company conflict with the sc101 device drivers . promise drivers are typically used for raid 1 or for sata drives . many newer computers use promise sata drivers . '' my computer is just a week old and has these newer drivers . back in the box the sc101 goes , and i try to uninstall the software as this product will not work for me . tried the 3 things when you have trouble it suggests , and none work . this is where i get really frustrated , netgear support . i waited 35 minutes for someone to pick up the phone , who ultimately told me it was my own fault and i 'd have to pay to have that `` cr*p '' , yes he said it , from my system . i needed to hire a local computer vendor and it would be my bill . i have to pay to get this junk off my computer . way to support your products netgear . the tech support person who got on the phone had an accent that was hard to understand , and went through huge mood swings during the call , from happy , to argumentative , to depressed , to happy again . i was freaked that this person knew my home address ! all in all , this is a great concept . after reading up on it and now experiencing it , i think it needs a ton more engineering and refinement before it is brought to market . maybe by a company with better customer service . it really requires a level of technical expertise that is not there with the average consumer
1	the only thing i will say about the bdp-s1 is that it is top quality . picture and sound quality are top-notch , but everything really depends on the software . now , if you are undecided about which camp to follow ( blu-ray or hd dvd ) , i 'm here to tell you that blu-ray will win . you see , i have both blu-ray and hd dvd . i have about 20 hd dvd movies and about 20 blu-ray movies . in terms of picture and sound quality , they are the same , but it is completely dependant on the software . but here is where the similarities end . 1 ) blu-ray is more durable . the bd movie discs have scratch-resistant coating . they do n't scratch unless you forcefully scratch them . on the other hand , the hddvd movies scratch like heck . i put all of my movies in a cd case . i recently noticed that all the hddvd movies are scratched , but none of the blu-ray movies are scratched . these are stored in the same cd case by me . i am extremely careful . none of my movies even have a fingerprint on them . so when i see scratches on 100 % of my hddvd movies , that really upsets me ! ! ! ! ! 2 ) blu-ray costs less to buy . what ? superman returns bd is $ 24 , superman hddvd is $ 28 . the departed bd is $ 24 , the departed hddvd is $ 28 . now the hddvd dual format has both a standard dvd and hddvd movie , but who in their right mind would want to buy an hddvd to watch a 480p picture ? right now you can get a $ 500 ps3 or $ 400 toshiba hddvd player . later this year , sony will come out with a $ 300 blu-ray disc player . hddvd will most likely drop their prices . so the hardware will cost the same in both formats . 3 ) blu-ray has more capacity . for less money , you can get a 50gb blu-ray movie versus a 30gb hddvd movie . and what if in 5 years they develope super high-definition 1920p picture and super hi-def 8.1 dts-hd sound ? what if this requires 75gb or 100gb ? hddvd can go up to 51gb . peace .
1	we have the original itrips but wanted this one for travel since it is much eaiser to tune in . the originals work great around town because it is always set on the same station . after reading the instructions i plugged the new itrip in and it worked perfectly just like the originals . not only did it work but it worked from 40 feet away . that is better than i expected after reading all the feedback . i 'm not sure what everyones problem is . it 's not a radio tower , it 's a transmitter the size of your finger . i get the feeling that some people think it should power the city block .
0	at first i loved the compact iaudio player , but after the first week , the earphone input ( hole in the player ) , did n't hold the input jack securely , resulting in no sound . i could jiggle it in the hole resulting in sound for about a second , but could not get it to work continuously . unfortunately , i threw away my receipt and box , or i would return it
1	the klipsch igroove can go toe to toe with the more expensive bose sound wave all day long . i researched dockable ipod / mp3 players for a few months before i decided on this one for my wife 's office . i 'm fussy when it comes to quality audio equipment , the i-grove does not disappoint . it provides room filling sound with no distorion . i listened to it extensively before wrapping it up for xmas to make sure it had the quality i insist on . it delivered . another bonus with the klipsch is it 's ability to accomodate other mp3 players and / or personal compact disc players . i 'm completely satisfied with my purchase of the klipsch i-groove .
0	purchased a total of 20 of these . i previously sold the american international brand sirius antenna but there was a temporary shortage in the market . four of the twenty terk brand units were dead on installation . sadly , i thought terk was a quality brand . my mistake !
0	i bought this to record tivo dvr stuff to dvd . worst frame rate capture and audio capture of .avi 's of the four different devices i have tried . completely unusable . the software is a trial version . instead , buy the ads dvdxpress dx2 for a bit more . ulead 's software is stable , and it 's not a trial version . it is also the only analog capture device i have tried that gives a good picture using mpeg capture . pinnacle 's dazzle only is tolerable using avi capture which is great if you have the drive space , but the software is way too buggy
0	no kidding ! ! the shipping charge on these batteries was over $ 6.00 . amazon does n't itemize the shipping charges on your order , so if you order multiple items , you wo n't know that you 're being raped by crutchfield until it is too late !
1	i agree that these are not top of the line . but they are n't bad at all . i get coasters occassionally even from top of the line media . i always burn at half the speed the media is designed for - 2x in this case . it takes longer , but i get good results . i am rarely in a hurry to burn a dvd . i would buy these again . ** updated on 7/3/2005 ** i have bought a new computer recently and i have been burning these dvds with full speed supported by the writer and no coasters what-so-ever . very happy with this product
1	compact flouresecent bulbs will not fit this fixture unless you order special cf 's with extended bases . other than that , it ca n't be beat for the price and quality . adorama rocks
0	the use of this ac power adaptor has increased the amount of static to the point where using the radio with the adaptor is pointless . on battery the radio works very well , just attach the adaptor and all reception is lost . invest in batteries rather than this product .
1	i love this product . the earbuds were even better than i had expected . i wanted something small that would n't hurt my ears and i wanted a long cord and that is just what i got . i am very happy with the product and the service . thank yo
0	i was looking for a small cheap mp3 player and i did n't care how much memory it had so this seemed perfect for me . i saw that many people had rated this 4 and 5 stars so i decided to buy it . when i got the creative nano i was really happy with its preformance until i tried to put my subscription music onto it . thats when i learned that it would n't hold any subscription music forcing me to buy my music one by one which is costing a lot of money . after that i started realising all of its imperfections . you ca n't use the fm radio in the car without hearing mostly static . you ca n't search through songs without actually changing the song you are listening to . do n't get me wrong , there are some good sides to this mp3 player but i still would definately not recommend it
0	if they were n't free , i 'd give them 1 star . media code : mcc 01rg20 . 2 of 10 were coasters at 4x with my dvdrw ide1008
1	these phones are great . sound quality is very good , including the speaker phone option . phones have many handy features , and all features are intuitive to use . no problem with the range . very easy to set up . battery life has proven to be no concern so far . the phones feel comfortable in the hand . i could n't be happier
1	sent quickly and nicely packaged . these will do the job for those desiring a shorter recording program
1	everything about the sonos worked as advertised . it was a snap to set up and it is slicker than i anticipated . the interface is commonsense and well thought out . it is the only decent solution for tying together multiple discrete sound systems within a house to play the same music simultaneously . you can also play different music , all obtained from the same computer source or internet radio . it is one of those rare products that instead of disappointing actually packs many pleasant surprises
1	totally agree with the other reviewers ' comments . originally , i was going to buy canon 's adapter for my powershot a640 not realizing it was plastic ! ! plus , even with shipping , this is still cheaper ( by 5 bucks ) and its metal ! fyi -- if you do n't have any filters ( like i did n't ) get tiffens 3 filter set 52mm ( circular polarizer , uv protector , and 812-warming len ) a good buy for the price -- i bought it because of the reviewers ' comments and do n't regret it
1	product performs per specifications and is easy to use . would like to see fuse easier to replace
0	sony advertised this as a 18x burner for dvd+r media . i used the recommended brand ( verbatim ) and taiko-yuden which are very high end media . i was only backing up home movies from my panasonic camcorder . the movies are in .mpeg format , i was only writing data and it should be no problem for any writter . unfortunately , i got only 12x write speed with the provided software , in a mac as well as in a pc . ( just slower than advertised , no clusters ) . it is a noisy drive too . i spoke with sony costumer service and i could not get any satisfactory answers . i had to wait a long time to be helped . they said that the drive was probably damaged . i returned it and i do not think the drive quality or the customer support represents the price of this drive .
0	i suffered with this clock for a year because it was a gift and expensive . even on the lowest setting the blue glow is so bright my finace says it looks like an alien spaceship is landing in the room . the sound is so-so and it has no battery backup , lose power for a second and you have to reset everthing . it is also very big , taking up 1/2 my nightstand . the final straw was that it has trouble tuning in even the strongest radio stations where i live . this morning i finally gave in , accepted reality and tossed it in the trash . i wo n't miss it at all
1	i enjoy this mouse . usually , i do n't like using the touch pad on laptops but after deciding to buy a mouse , i had to look for a specific mouse that would fit into my lifestyle as a student . i have small hands and i hate carrying out heavy objects in my bookbag . since i have to lug my laptop around , i needed a mouse that did n't take a lot of space , is good enough to withstand constant shifting in my laptop , and that worked well with my needs . pros : small size , optical , scrolling tab , and portability cons : sometimes the mouse jumps around a bit on its own . but this happens only a few times every few weeks - so it 's not often enough to cause a problem for me . enjoy
1	buy it and you will not live home without it . if i would rate this product , i will rated a 6 stars .
1	works well , especially for anyone who still has their old console systems in use . i have my nes and snes , both of which have huge ac adapters , plugged into this . it saves tons of space on my power strip . the design is a little clumsy though , so it 's only getting 4/5
0	these xtreme cd cases stinks , literally ! i do n't know what kind of plastic material they are using and if they are toxic , but the smell is absolutely nauseous . i kept it for two weeks hoping the smell would go away . nope . finally i threw it away . other than the smell , quality-wise it is ok .
0	this media did not work on my brand new asus burner , even after updating the firmware
1	this is an awesome little device . let me start with the pros : 1 ) easy : incredibly easy setup ( literally press one button - never believed it , but it 's true . plug in the usb transmitter , press the blue button voila . ) 2 ) good sound : for a small set of speakers , these things sound great . they are not going to compare to speakers hooked up to your rack stereo system , but sound very good and comparable to a $ 45 two-speaker set of monitor-side speakers . there 's a built in sub-woofer that helps as well . 3 ) wireless range : with 4 aa batteries , you can carry this little guy around your whole house - and outside your house . reception is great . i am used to bluetooth headsets that do n't really work much further than 10 feet from the phone - i had doubts about bluetooth speakers , but i am amazed with reception these guys have . 4 ) controls : the forward , reverse pause buttons on the speaker work fine with both media player or yahoo music engine running on the laptop ( the only two i tried ) . again , i was surprised , but they worked flawlessly . 5 ) cool : as far as cool factor , this little guy is definitely that . cons : 1 ) no remote : it would be nice if there was a remote control for the unit that would allow you to control the sound , ff , rw , pause , play controls . 2 ) no control from pc : you ca n't control the sound ( or mute ) from the laptop - only from the speakers . 3 ) sound : above i said the sound was good - and it is considering the size of this system . however , these are small speakers and a mini-sub and the sound is thus somewhat small too . it 's good , but it 's not going to compare to a quality set of speakers hooked up to your rack stereo system . there is base but not a great deal - you definitely wo n't feel the music with these speakers . 4 ) volume : volume is limited - it 's enough to fill a mid-sized room , but not much more . for $ 100 , this is an outstanding little speaker system that does an amazing job with no wires . carry it to your kid 's room . to the garage . to the basement . no wires , nothing . if convenience is and portability is important to you , and if medium sound quality is ok , then i would highly recommend this speaker system . it 's great . personally , i 'm not sure if i 'm going to keep them because i would really like fuller sound ( this was an attempt at easy speakers for my living room ) and more base - but they 're so cool and convenient , that i doubt i 'll be able to give them up ! for other bluetooth ideas and wi-fi network options , see my post at the hydrogen audio forum : [ ... ]
1	it costs 30 % - 40 % less than the canon la-dc58f conversion lens adapter and it 's metal , not plastic ... need to say more
1	i use the memory card in my samsung d807 phone . works perfecty
0	this is a piece of junk holy cow is it cruddy do n't even call it a guitar because its not its a bad thing to call it a guitar holy crud `` where 's the tylenol !
0	there 's a reason this thing is only 6 bucks . it 's absolute junk . i put it into the cassette player in my car , and the sounds were completely distorted . the voice constantly skips , and the casette sometimes clicks . the quality of sound in my car is usually amazing , and basically there was no bass sound coming through my speakers using this device . i 've tried both sides , but still no avail . i plan on returning it if shipping does n't cost more than the product itself
0	i 'm sure this product is fine . but do n't order it through amazon , through ritz camera . they just cancelled my order without warning , having listed that the bag was available . freaking idiots
1	what i ordered - on time delivery - good price
0	we bought this machine for a christmas present for the inlaws , knowing i 'd wind up installing it . the first disk played fine , but while i was eating lunch my father-in-law tried moving to a different cd . it would n't play . it 'd go back to the first disk and play it fine . so , i shut it down , restarted on disk 2 and now it played fine , but would n't go back and play disk 1 ! i moved the disks around to other slots and still they skipped like an old-fashioned vinyl record with a scratch . both cds worked fine in another player . in the meantime , mother-in-law is busy putting her collection of cds into groups for me to program . not this holiday season . this sucker 's going back to the big box store from wence it came !
1	this arm-band is surprisingly good . i initially got it for my boyfriend for his iriver , but i was afraid it would n't fit his arms since he 's very muscular . surprisingly - it stretched enough and was n't tight ! he loves it . i thought there might be too much motion on mine when i run or use the eliptical , but no , it 's fine
1	outstanding cleaner for your cd or cdrw , mp3 player . takes you through many diagnostic tests . even has a dolby test . well worth the money and you will be more than pleased with it . i used it on both my pc cd and cdrw drives as well as my stereo cd player . fantastic product ! !
0	i was impressed with this controller at first , and found it to feel comfortable , and work well . it was played with once and a while for about a month ( total 10 hours max ) . some time after that , the next time i went to use it , it would only go left in a game that used the left joystick . i could not get it to center ( or even stay still ) , it would just keep either steering the car ( like burnout3 ) or whatever the left joystick would do for the game no matter what . i tried it several times , and it has never worked since . i fire it up once and a while to see if it 's still doing it , and it does . i am very dissapointed in this , and i was pretty careful about getting this newer version of the logitech controller . i think i paid about $ 45 locally for it , and i just bought a pelican extreme edge from radio shack on clearance for $ 19.99 that works and feels as good , but is less than half the cost . i do n't really feel like going thru a warranty claim , if it 's even covered , but it still annoys me every time i look at it in my xbox 'drawer ' of extra stuff . i was going to go totally wireless ( 4 units ) and luckily did n't run out and buy 3 more of these logitech controllers . i instead bought some extra microsoft s controllers , as they are still one of the best feeling controllers out there . if the pelican holds up , ( model pl-2050 version 2.0 ) i might go get some more if i can find them locally .
0	these are $ 10 headphones . there 's nothing amazing about them in my opinion . i bought them to use with my ipod when i 'm out , or at work . right out of the box , i was disappointed with the fit , and i know everyone is going to be different , but for me they just are n't comfortable . the sound quality is clear , but very thin and lacking bass . even when i 'm pressing them into my ears to get the best possible fit , the bass just is n't good . eq settings to boost the bass do n't help either , and often reduce sound quality even more . the ear clips do n't really seem to do that much either . they kind of keep them on your ears but do n't really hold them in your ears at all . the ear pieces tend to get tangled together easily as well . in summary , i would n't recommend these for music , but if you want a cheap pair of headphones for listening to audio books or some other kind of spoken word , they might be good-if you can tolerate them in your ears for that long
1	i agree with the prior review of these jbl e10s , however i 'd go to the e20s for a small room main stereo set -- better bass worth the slight price increase . bought for rear channel ( rc ) use , i find the e10s quite `` airy '' , with what seems like a better high frequency response than the main e30s i just bought from a'.com ( see my 5 star review ) , giving extremely open and detailed `` surround '' rc performance . note : the specs listed on a'.com for the e10s state `` bi-wireable : yes '' but ... unless jbl has just changed the terminals to do this that 's wrong -- mine have just a single terminal set , and do n't bother with the pricey speaker mounts offered as accessories ( unless you plan ceiling installs ) as they come with two `` slide down '' screw slots attached to the back for wall installation . surfing for the best price , i bought mine refurbished from [ ... ] for a low $ 53.00 bid plus $ 18.00 s+h directly from jbl and you may find the e30s/e20s from jbl as refurbs there as well . as rc speakers -- especially at the price i got them -- i recommend them highly , well deserving the 5 star rating given
1	i am extrememly happy with this one . for the price , it delivers well . the voice recorder works well . my key need was to record lectures and listening to them . worked out very well
0	300-500 yards under the best conditions . given its heft , a waste of mone
0	this is not an xd to compactflash card adapter . if you order this item number , you will receive a pc card adapter that accepts xd picture cards and smartmedia cards and fits your pcmia 2.1 slot on a pc or mac . it is not for a camera or substitute for a compactflash card . there is nothing compact flash about it . the product you will recieved does not look like the photo on amazon 's website
1	this is exactly what i was looking for : not too expensive , not much hassle with the cables - they are integrated with the unit , and no need to reach for the button to switch computers - simply press `` scroll lock '' twice to go from one computer to the other . cables are pretty long , which is good : longer that i need at the moment , but i may appreciate the extra length in the future .
1	just remember to use the proper cable , cat 5e or cat 6
0	i agree with the other review , sony brand vhs tapes have begun a steady decline in quality over the past years . as a almost life long user of sony premium grade tapes , i have begun to notice a sharp drop in the picture and sound quality i get when i record , even off my dish . the picture is never up to snuff with what i see when i watch the show as it is being recorded . for the past two years , i have been able to notice the differences when i am watching something on a sony tape , the flaws have become to big to ignore . i will be buying tdk from now on , and i suggest you do the same . sony used to make a great vhs tape , but i guess they are concentrating now on making more playstations
0	consumers should be aware of serious design flaws which exist in samsung dlp televisions . cooling fans and color wheels are highly susceptible to failing . ( as a non-techniocal person i should have no idea what these parts are , but alas , i bought a samsung dlp ) expect these to fail within 1-2 years . expect to pay approx $ 400 to replace the color wheel and $ 200 to replace the colling fan . that is , if your service technician can find them in stock anywhere . these parts are commonly in a national backorder because of the very high failure rates . you should also expect the lamp to fail sooner than advertized . many people need to purchase a new lamp between 1-2 years , and some more often than that . the lamp costs approx $ 150- $ 250 depending on your model , but you should be able to replace it yourself without too much difficulty . this cost will be in addition to replacement costs for the color wheel and colling fan . please remember that these maintenance costs are recurring , and you will have to fix them again in another 1-2 years . while i was very satisfied with the quality and performance of my dlp , my color wheel failed very early . i called tech support to report a grinding noise , and was told to `` turn it off '' , wait 15 minutes , and turn it back on like this would fix the problem . after doing this for a while , the color wheel finally failed , actually shattered ! now i am out of warranty , and samsung wants nothing to do with me . i have even tried ordering the part myself from two different online vendors , and they are both backordered indefinitely ! it has been 6 weeks and they have no estimate for when this part will be available . samsung can not even give me an estimate when the supply of replacement parts is expected to meet demand . i have had my tv for 18 months , and apparently there is a national epidemic of them breaking at the same time ! i have a 42 '' samsung plasma which is a beautiful set along with a 26 '' crt . both are wonderful products , but samsung is selling dlp lemons and will not stand behind them . dlp is a great bargain up front , but a maintenance nightmare ! you will pay in the long run , and by the long run i mean every 2 years . if you still want to purchase a dlp television , please buy the extended warranty ! it will save you a ton , but you will still have to wait for the circuit city tech to find parts which may take months ! i expect samsung to abandon their design flaw riddled dlp sector , and focus on their beautiful plasma line . expect dlp prices to drop even further , but please ... look before you leap
0	i bought these head phones because i read all the reviews that gave it 4 's and 5 's , so i expected a lot out of them . the truth is you really should n't ... they do n't sound particularly awesome and i was rather disappointed that i actually spent close to $ 30.00 after shipping and stuff . the mid-highs and highs sound fine , but i had issues with bass and mid-low response , especially when i plugged it into my computer . plus they are not super comfortable either ; the hinges nip at your neck when you do n't have them on your head and they fit funny if you have glasses . all in all , i wished i had spent my money on something else . but they do look pretty cool .
1	this card works exactly as stated by startech . i bought two - one for a pc and one for a mac , popped 'em in and plugged in ipods , external hardrives , a scanner , and digital cameras and the cards worked perfectly . the pc needed a quick setup and the mac worked instantly ! and all at a great price ! ca n't figger out why you guys are having trouble
0	the product does not work in my view . i have to review every card and have to manually correct the extracted information in 95 % of the cases . it is not much different than entering the information manually . the character recognition software has a long way to go to be effective . does not even recognize that `` wireless '' is the mobile phone number . one would think that they would get it right after all these versions and years . the only good thing is once you scan the cards , you can throw them away , but still have to spend the same amount time entering the information by hand .
1	i do n't understand the 1 star reviews , unless there is some product variability . price was $ 60 at target . talk time is ok , although the longest i have been on the phone is maybe 10 or 15 minutes . range is fine . phone works all over the house , and audio quality if fine
0	we wanted the zoom and missed the fact that this one does not have the zoom . the reason i give two stars is because of beach camera 's return policy . they grudgingly allowed me to return it , as a one-time courtesy with a restocking fee . i wish amazon would tag the vendors so we could easily see if we were buying from this type of company
1	the pro and cons described by other reviews are valid . i was specifically looking for a boombox that has cassette , mp3 , cd and radio capability . so did n't have much of an option but to get this one . i am impressed with the sound quality but agree that there could have been improvements related to interface and some of the functionality . overall i think its a good buy .
1	we used this remote to program a sony av-rm3000 remote , but we need more flexibility for our htpc . in hindsight , we should have bought a stand-alone ir unit and something like the girder software . or , maybe just an ir wireless keyboard . this is not a remote for those seeking flexibility , or those who like to customize their media experience . this is an excellent remote for those who want out-of-the-box usability , and do n't want to bother with customization . it 's well-built , and will be exactly what many mainstream users are looking for . pros : comfortable shape , sensible layout , high-quality feel , reasonably compatible with many programs cons : does n't do absolutely everything in every compatible application , only four somewhat-programmable keys with limited option
0	they totally misrepresent this product . it does not work with macs . i feel cheated and lied to by memorex , shame on you
0	i have the luxury of writing this review a little bit further out in the technology cycle than most of the others , so i can say : just get yourself a better wireless router . based on the reviews here , several online fora , and my own personal experience , i can confirm to you that you have about a 30 % chance of actually getting this to work , and you might get that percentage up a little bit if you keep returning defective ones and trying another . but why bother ? at this point , there are higher-power routers , high-gain directional antennae , and there are even products sporting 802.11n , which inherently has a better range that -a , -b , or -g. if you 've gotten into a situation where your router is inadequate for your needs , research and get yourself a top-notch router with good broadcast power -- i would strongly recommend against trying to remedy an inadequate router by trying to add this product to your network . i understand that my suggestion may be more expensive , but i am seriously saying that you will avoid wasting any more than necesary of the precious remainder of your time on this earth . definitely hours ( if , by some miracle , everything works on the 12th or 13th try ) , and probably a couple of days ( assuming that after 24 or 25 tries you send back the first one and try again with a new one )
0	i just got it and am fighting my way through getting it to work in vista ultimate . it claims to have a qam tuner , but i 'll be damned if it can find any digital/hd channels on my cable . my qam tv gets many . very disappointed , documentation is at best lacking . look elsewhere .
0	tilting the foot rest back and forth is not the easiest thing in the world . it 's just cheap plastic rubbing on cheap plastic so it sticks a lot . mine broke in 2 different spots within a month..
0	got it in december ; cd player stopped working in april and now the radio reception is so bad i 'm tossing it . ca n't provide paperwork for refund as it was a gift
1	the lable maker was removed from the box and put into action with ease . product is easy to use and understand . for the money a great purchase .
0	i connected all the cables as instructed , but it does n't work , the light is not on . so i return it to amazon
1	i just recently bought a sub-woofer and i spent a good deal of time searching for an interconnect . the interconnects i looked at ranged from ridiculously over-priced to questionably cheap . i knew i wanted it to be thx certified and of a length that would allow me some freedom of sub-woofer placement . this interconnect provided both at a very reasonable price . i must say after installing my subwoofer that this cable was a perfect choice . some might say that the cost reflects a cables ability to provide good sound . wrong . this is just as good as those 70 dollar interconnects . i do buy monster cable for most of my home theatre needs , but i do not buy into some of the hype surrounding monster cable and their more expensive cables . why only 4 and not 5 stars . i did not like the way the cable was packaged . the cable was folded down the middle and now the center of the cable has a crook in it . i would have perfered it to be wound around a plastic spool to avoid folding of the cable . getting past that , its a good interconnect that produces great sound .
1	i 've owned and use the sony 256mb memory stick pro pictured ( in black ) , and currently also use a 1gb sony memory stick pro . i 've not had any problems with them , formatting or otherwise , over long periods of heavy use . ok , a little pricier than , say , sd cards , but a good quality product for sony digital cameras .
0	i 've only got this thing to work for about 3 hours and that is not in a row . i 've spent hours with this product on several machines and i can now say the hardware sucks .
1	things that i like : ( 1 ) the option to tile the front of the keyboard up makes typing much more comfortable . i was a skeptic about it before i purchased it , but really do like it . also , this is the first keyboard that i have used that allows for so many typing angles . ( 2 ) the included software gives a great deal of control over customizing all of the extra keys on the keyboard . even if you do n't have windows vista , you can program the gadgets key to suit your needs . ( 3 ) the keyboard has no lag for me , whatsoever . ( 4 ) i 'm a big fan of the standard 3x2 key setup for the home keys , etc . ( 5 ) this is a small change , but i 'm using this setup on dell inspiron 6000 laptop . the software replaced the large volume notifications ( onscreen display showing volume level , mute , etc . ) with a smaller more attractive style notification . me gusta . ( 6 ) the curved keyboard is also comfortable . it requires no time nor effort getting used to it . ( 7 ) i have n't had any problems with the keyboard being `` out of range . '' ( 8 ) for the mouse , i 'm switching from the wireless intellimouse explorer 3.0 , which is also made by microsoft , to the laser 6000 mouse included . this new mouse is more comfortable . ( not a huge difference , but noticeable . ) it is also lighter , and slides around with little effort . what i do n't like : ( 1 ) the lock key above the number pad is set by default to display the same two options as when you click 'start ' then 'log off windows . ' i would have liked the option to change the key to the shut down / hibernate dialog instead . i have n't found that option available , so far . ( 2 ) the keyboard is a little bit wider than others , but i do n't find it to be a problem . it 's just different . having the additional programmable buttons outweighs the downside of having the extra width . five stars
1	below is my experience with this product after owning it for 2 weeks . pros : -- -- - 1 . amazing sound especially when watching dvd movies 2 . very good progessive scan dvd picture quality 3 . simple , compact and all-in-one design 4 . remote control can work with various tv 's , cable boxes and vcr 's 5 . can play both ntsc and pal dvd 's cons : -- -- - 1 . expensive 2 . no hdmi output 3 . non-intuative remote control 4 . no headphone jack overall , i love and chose the bose 321 because of the sound quality and compact design . i got this system because i wanted a compact all-in-one media center and i was not interested in getting a htib with 5 speakers . i looked at denon ( 2 products ) , sony and samsung . i use this on my 23 '' samsung lcd tv using monster component video cables and while i would have preferred to take advatange of its hdmi capabilties , the reality is that i am very happy with this image quality . movies such as lord of the rings , the matrix and hero look and sound fantastic . prior to this i was looking at the sony dav-x1 which is much cheaper and more feature-rich . however the internal turmoils between their consumer electronics and media divisons convince me this would not work for me . for example , my pal dvds can not be played on the sony whereas on the bose it was no problem . i am of the opinion that sony is a directionless company and this is reflected in their products . to be fair you do need to have the right kind of room to take advantage of their truespace 2.1 surround sound feature . my couch is up against the wall with the media center located 12 ft in front of me . according to bose the speakers should ideally be 3 feet away from the tv . sometimes truespace works and sometimes i ca n't hear it . i believe this is true among all the other competitors in this market line and that neither one stands out ahead of the other . if surround sound is really that important to you , then you should get a 5.1 system . this product is perfect for a small room as it takes advantage of the echos of the room where it can fake a 3d sound and would probably not be ideal for a family size rec-room . the audio quality from music cd 's is very good and while i wish this had an ipod port as found on the denon , i am very content using the aux port
1	i bought this memory card for my camera sd500 . at first , i was very dispointed when i only see 1gb on my laptop . after googled around , i realized i need to update my laptop sd reader driver to recognized sd card that is over 1gb . i 'm able to see full 2gb after driver update . just make sure you update your device/laptop firmware/driver first
0	you 'll end up looking for something better . sound fidelity is pretty bad .
0	not very happy with this product . the software on the pc side does n't work well at all . wo n't list all my files and i ca n't get it to update changes or new folders . this bugger has way to big of a foot print . the remote needs a skip function to fast foward through movies . hey i have a xbox with xbmc on it . get a clue , and copy some of it 's functionality . it continues to blow away any of the media players i have purchased
1	the wireless lavalier microphone system is perfect for informational interviewing and personal media management . it provides a portable option to amplified audient properties and gives the user a greater degree of movement during presentations . it can be used as a binary system , ( two separate microphone systems and a small amplifier are needed ) to interview your favorite personality , take testimonials or to exchange opinions with local leaders . the wireless lavalier makes the idea addition to any media kit
0	after purchasing the item in december 2006 it didnt take even a week before the troubles started , it kept freezing after switching it on and took quite long to rebuild the data . at one point , ( after two weeks ) i lost all my data . despite downloading the software from the website the problems didnt disappear and i am basically left with a promising player which doesnt even allow me to listen to music without frezing . since then i am struggling with creative technical support team as there is advise given to charge my battery or download the software from the website ( which both is not been of much help ) this player hasnt been much of use to me yet and i deeply regret having paid 360 usd . i gave it 2 stars because i was able to watch 2 movies while waiting at the airport and travelling , this was quite a pleasure
1	this tv/monitor rocks ! ! i 've been looking for a combo computer monitor and tv that i could use in my office . this lcd does both very well . i 'm writing this review with the lns4696d installed and everything on the screen is very large ( what i wanted ) even at 1600x1200 and the resolution is far better than i expected ! !

1	like the name suggests , the m-audio audiophile 2496 is for true audiophiles . i have had this card for years and there still is few options that are on par with this card for the same money . the audiophile has a full dynamic range of crisp audio with little distortion . i connect my sound card via digital coaxial cable to my harman kardon avr 240 and the sound is amazingly clear . the one drawback to this card is it may be difficult for some to learn to use at first . however , when quality is essential go with the audiophile 2496 .
0	i 'm not the most gadget inclined person , and this was given to me as a gift because it was easy to install and use . but i have to say i 've had a lot of frustration with this device because the gain for the mic input is tweaked out - it 's either off or on , but there 's not much gradation between the two . in fact i get almost no gain at all until i reach almost the `` 3:00 '' position on the dial . and then it 's a lot , and my vocals tend to clip out with the slightest volume variation . it basically keeps me locked into soft , close singing , and a girl ca n't do that all the time ! other than that i have n't had any problems , but that one almost renders it useless . i do n't know if there 's something more reliable ( and sane ) out there , but if there is , go for that instead . even if it costs more . why spend money on something that does n't work
0	please do n't expect to get the cash back from this purchase as promised ! to date , i 've been denied twice . the second time they said the u p c number was invalid . only , it 's the original u p c barcode ! i was meticulous filing the paperwork , yet they state , `` all required products were not submitted . '' meanwhile , i have phoned amaz0n to lodge a formal complaint . the product itself is average . i 've used better and worse . that said , it 's definitely not worth the full asking price
0	when it works it does extend the range . however , every time you turn off a wirelessly connected pc and turn it on again , the pc is not assigned an ip number . unplug this extender , and the pc is assigned an ip number by the router without any problem . a brief power blackout will cut ip numbers to your wirelessly-connected pcs . i purchased this particular d-link range extender because i wanted to ensure that it works well with my di-624 router . i wasted my money buying this device . it 's useless , and it 's too light to even serve as a door stop..
0	issue solved ! i returned the harmony for a full refund . all thanks to my experience with your wonderful support team . after screwing up everything on christmas day ( it was a christmas present ) ) , your support staff said `` level 2 '' would contact me within 24 hours . after waiting 72 hours , i called `` support '' again yesterday . after waiting 30 minutes , i finally got to speak with a real-live agent who `` could not switch me to level 2 without a supervisor 's approval . '' this was after providing the incident number . that took another 15 minutes . i then waited another 30 minutes ( total now 1:15 ) before i had to leave . i tried again several hours later . after being told `` level 2 was not available . '' i hung up and immediately returned my harmony to ... . thanks , logitech . -keit
1	i purchased this as a gift for my 56-year-old mother who simply ca n't get enough scrabble with her friends . while i did not get the opportunity to use the product myself , she seems quite enthusiastic about its abilities . just make sure your opponents approve and dont think you are trying to cheat .
1	great sound . love the volume control on the wire . great fit to almost any head size or shape . overall a great purchase and i love their product
0	if you are not an it person you will need help setting up .using d-link customer service is a chore due to language issues .i bought the video phone to contact my son in taiwan and it never would connect ==d-link help line ? ? ==could not understand why and were of no help what so ever .i could reach the test location but that was it .=complete waste of money ! !
1	the reception is much better than my old antenna , however , i was expecting instructions to be included with the antenna . after some time i figured out how to hook up the tv and vcr to the antenna
0	wasted hours trying unsuccessfully to install the driver for the iogear gic251u 5-port usb card on a dell optiplex gx-1 running 98se . ( this computer already has 2 usb 1.1 ports . ) the main problem is that the add hardware wizard does not find a *.inf file in the iogear-supplied cd folder and does not recognize the executable program that is in the cd folder . user has to cancel out of the wizard and execute the driver installation file as a stand-alone program . this results in installation of drivers that show up in the device manager . however , the installation wizard comes up at every subsequent reboot and the user must cancel out of it just to get the computer going . installed card seemed to work ok for a d-link wireless adapter , but did not recognize a digital camera that was satisfactorily recognized by one of the non-iogear 1.1 ports . the following actions did not help . ( 1 ) swapping the card to another pci slot , ( 2 ) downloading and installing more recent driver file from iogear website , ( 3 ) three calls to customer support , where i found sympathy but so solution
1	this cartridge is very light , easy to install and allows the printer to print out very good quality , durable black ink on the page . it is competitively priced and stores for about a year after you buy it so if you want to stock up for your office or personal printing needs that 's great ! ( it even comes with an expiration date ! ) hp also packs it well so that it is difficult for the cartridge to become damaged during transit . one thing that i did n't like , however , is that the ink can go quickly . if you print a lot , you might even need to replace this cartridge every ten days or so . my needs are about 20 pages per week and i have to change the cartridge roughly every five to six weeks . that 's not good ; although to be fair to this hp ink cartridge i am printing graphics . four stars ( well , maybe three and one half stars ) for being great ink in an easy to manage and install cartridge . it loses points for not lasting longer .
0	i purchased a sony 5-disk cd changer in 1991 that could shuffle between all five disks . this model can only shuffle tracks on one disk at a time . what were they thinking ? the ability to shuffle tracks between disks was my entire reason for choosing a five disk changer vs. a single disk cd/dvd player . this baby is going back
1	first off ... i like this unit . it 's easy to use , and it does a fine job of taking your old lps and making cds out of them . all you need to do is place a blank audio cd into the deck ( it does n't work with regular data cds ) , hit the phono/aux button , followed by the record button and then after you place the needle on the lp ... take it out of pause . it starts recording instantly . between each song , hit a button and it break the recording into tracks . pretty cool ! it 's got great potential , but there are still a few shortcomings . for example , i was surprised to see that it does n't let you record off of the radio . just as surprising to me was the fact that the radio tuner was n't digital . it 's a pain in the neck having to fiddle with the dial to tune in to your favorite stations . you turn back and forth over and over like it was a radio from 40 years ago . i would n't mind the analog tuner too much if it at least had a handful of presets . this also makes the remote control somewhat useless too . oddly , the remote does have an am/fm button . they should just label it the `` radio '' button , because when you think of it , switching from am to fm or vice versa using the remote makes no sense at all because you would need to re-tune the station too , using the dial . another key point is that the unit does n't have any outputs at all . so you ca n't pipe the output from the turntable into your other systems or use any other speakers . i would rate this as 3.5 stars , but since we ca n't use half stars , i 'll give it 4 for one big reason ... . for all it 's shortcomings , it works , and there are very few alternatives . speaking of alternatives , here are a few other options . 1 . a standalone cd-recorder . i have one of these too . the advantage of this type of deck is that it fits into your existing system like an old cassette deck . in my case , my stand alone unit has two drives , so not only can i record from any source in my system , but i can dub from one drive to the other . also , my deck can make mp3 cds from regular cds ( it 's easier than using a pc , however the song titles are just numbers ) . in my case , i opted not to use this for my lp projects , because i no longer have a turntable . i decided that as long as i needed a new turntable , i might as well pay a bit more for this unit . 2 . crosley makes a simuilar unit , but it costs a bit more and the reviews i read seemed to point out that although it looks better , the turntable itself was flimsy and it skipped a lot . 3 . a portable digital recorder like the ikey plus . i found one of these a few weeks ago and i love it . you plug your turntable or other external source into it ... plug a usb storage device into the port tap a button or two to decide the quality ( .wav vs several mp3 sampling rates ) ... viola ! it records directly to your flash drive , ipod or external hard drive . if you do go that route , make sure you get the `` plus '' model . the older model is outdated and does n't work as well . 4 . use a pc . even though it will give you the best possible sound and options , it 's out of the question for me because i do not want to move my pc near my stereo every time i want to make a recording , nor do i want to move my stereo next to my pc ... or bog it down while i 'm trying to use it for that matter . keep in mind that if you record your cds using one of the stand alone decks , you can still clean up the hiss and pops by loading the cds you made into a pc afterwards , then filtering the files with your favorite audio software , then re-burn the files to cd or mp3 .
0	i have not been able to get this to work again . it was great for the first week , then it made my computer crash and now i can not get it installed again . i am not sure i like that
0	i bought this product to help cleaning the lense of my auto cd player . i tried it for at least 10 times , but no luck . wet clean the lense manually is the best way , but that will include getting the player out from the dash board
0	do not by this product . it has several issues . go to the forums on the linksys website and see for yourself . most people , myself included , have problems with the cable modem crashing and requiring a reset on a regular basis . this device also has firewall issues that cause problems with the wii and xbox360 . it 's spi firewall component is at fault and can not be disabled without turning off the entire firewall . even in the face of the number of users having problems linksys has never released a firmware update and it does n't appear that they will
0	i bought this last christmas for my three year old and five year old . thesound of the piano is a little off , but all in all the piano is nice for the price . the leg of the stool breaks very easily . do n't buy unless you can fix
0	it was a great product when it worked . sleek design , super user friendly , sharp image and easily unlock to all region . never had any problem loading or playing until last week . went completely dead for no reason in the middle of a movie . swallowed the dvd with it . it would 've been a greater product if it lived pass 1 year at least
1	i purchased the lj3390 to replace an existing lj3320 . the $ 350 rebate available until the end of oct was the deciding factor as it made the unit a very reasonable purchase . my main interest in the upgrade was to purchase a network connected printer . duplex print capability was the other factor that tipped the scale in favour of the lj3390 over the lj3052 . i now have 3 desktop and 2 laptop printers all printing successfully . all run xp sp2 and are either connected via a wired or wireless network connection . software installation went flawlessly . while i ca n't comment about hp versus other vendor software , i can say that the lj3390 software is a major improvement over that of my lj3320 . scanning is faster by at least a factor of 2x , quite likely more like 3-4x . printing of complex pages is also much faster , exactly what i would expect from a newer generation print engine and an hp laserjet printer . all in all i am very pleased that i upgraded . it has met all my upgrade goals . printing is faster , scanning is much faster . the network connectivity ensures anyone can print without another machine being forced to be a print server and constantly left on . i have n't played with the fax side yet , but am hoping this finally let 's me retire my trusty standalone fax machine .
0	you do n't have to spend a fortune on expensive cables when you are dealing with digital signals . keep in mind that all digital interfaces have error correction built into them . did you know the internal components of consumer electronics are connected with tin and nickel ? there 's no gold inside ! so there 's no need for oxygen-free , gold tipped , multi sheilded , super mega supreme cables . if you do n't believe me , buy this cable and a no-name cheapie . compare them for yourself -- you will see no difference . with analog signals , a good quality cable may make a difference ( although the difference is usually only visible on an oscilloscope ) .
0	it says it 's an a/v dock for video ipods but it only would transmit audio to my tv . i 'm really pissed about this product.what a waste ! a/v cables that sell for 20 $ are incredible . they sinply plug into the headphone jack of my 80 gig ipod and into the a/v inputs of my tv
0	amazon fail to deliver item within a reasonable time . the item fail to arrive and therefore we never received the good
1	not quite as bright a conventional flashlight , but certainly bright enough . no battery feature ca n't be beat . manufacturer claims it will stay on for a hour with a one minute wind . i 've never left mine on that long , but i 've only needed to wind it once in over a year . this is an excellent flashlight . i 've bought several
1	i love the sling media slingbox tuner ! the install was very easy just as they had said on the reviews . the quality of picture is just as good as on my cable tv . i have a great processor with the highest internet speed i could get though my cable so that may contribute to the good quality picture and color i get with it and may also be the reason i have had no problems with doing computer work and watching the screen at the same time . plue my shipment from amazon was in 2 days ! you rock amazon !
0	do not buy this if you own the c340 -- it does n't fit and amazon should n't market this as if it will . it 's a nightmare to have to get it returned and get a refund . this is also true for the cigarette lighter adapter -- i hope there will be clarity as to which accessories go with each model otherwise , you 'll be in for a lot of wasted time and money . the garmin is great , but the fact that most of their accessories are not compatible within the product family is a huge problem .
0	this product is great the only problem i have is that upon downloading the drivers for this item i get a warning from my server stating that this devise does not have an id certificate and it advises me not to use this item for it may damage my computer . i want to use this item but i am afraid to please verify you certificate so i can complete my downloa
0	i bought this hd because my lacie ( which had lasted over 5 years ) crashed on me finally . so i figured i would try a different company . out of the box this product looked great , although it was very large and heavy . i immediately plugged it in to test it and it came up - however that was the one and only time that it booted . i tried several more times and it would n't boot up . very very scary when you buy a new device to hold all you important data and it wo n't boot up out of the box . i do n't know if this product just happened to be the one that sucked - but i am not taking any chance on a defective hd and my data . going back to lacie
1	got 3 of them a few months ago , and buying another one now . excellent product , fits many different plug types . no flaws .
1	the product works fine . it seems kind of strange that i had to purchase a package of 10 in order to get just the 2 that i needed . the linksys unit is just attached to the bracket by pressure so i ran a long zip tie through the bracket and around the linksys units to make sure they did n't pop off
1	this xd memory card works perfectly with my camera fujifilm finepix f650 . good buy for the price
1	if your a serious gamer and want the best quality money can buy , like me , i would highly suggest this product . sounds are crystal clear , and fiber optics is the next step up in technology . my first question for you would be , `` how much do you invest in your gaming ? '' . once again , if your like me the answer is a lot . my next question would be `` how important is your audio experience ? '' you dont know what your missing out on until you actually experience the difference . very happy with this product
1	just a note to those who 've been having trouble opening these cases , without breaking them . if you use an emory board to slightly sand the top knob which is holding the case together , you 'll be able to open and close it ok. do n't sand too much , and just do the top knob , or it wo n't hold together . i like the fact that these cases are clear and fairly inexpensive , so i wanted to make them work . hope it works for you
0	7 out of the 25 disks would not write . i didnt much care for the product considering this factor .
1	if you want a budget home theater system for under $ 200 there is probably not many systems better then the sony ht-ddw700 . this system is ideal for small rooms such as a bed room or a tiny living room . considering the price , sound quality is actually better then expected for me . the tiny cube speakers presents pretty good clarity . they may look like cheap computer speakers but they are n't and are a bit heavier then they look . the center channel may be a little underpowered since dialog during dvd movies sound a tad soft and a little too low . the surround effects during movies in dolby digital and dts are very good though . if set up properly the speakers handle surround effects very well . some minor complaints is that the speaker wire attached to the speakers are very thin . they are fixed and ca n't be replaced . also , if you want heart stopping bass then this system might not be for you . the 8 '' subwoofer is okay considering the price of the system . it is currently better then any other sub included in a home theater system under $ 200 . it is n't powered , is very light ( only 9 lbs ) and you have to be pretty close to actually feel the bass . the volume would have to be cranked up extremely high for the sub to actually rattle your walls . the receiver comes with 1 optical and 1 coxial digital input and 4 rca analog inputs . it should be enough in most cases . an extra digtal input or two would n't hurt but again the system is under $ 200 . setup could n't be easier . you just hook up the included microphone , place it at your listening postion and press a button on the remote . the system will automatically sets up the speaker distance , delay and volume levels . the receiver comes with the basic pro logic ii music and move modes to upmix your stereo sources . it also has other sound fields and effects to enhace the sound but they do n't really seem to enhance the sound by that much if at all . basically , if you want a home theater system for a small room and for under $ 200 then there is n't much better then the sony ht-ddw70
1	i travel overseas a lot for my job . this little power strip is compact and enables you to keep one adapter on the end of it to plug into the funky wall plug and then use your `` normal '' plugs for operating four devices . most monster products are terribly overpriced and not worth the money ( wires , cables , etc . ) but this gizmo rocks
0	i own one of these , it came packaged in my dell xps renegade . sound in a windows environment is good , as indicated by other reviews . but in a gaming environment for example world of warcraft , and not just this game , i and other user 's have experienced the squeal of death , wherein the sound will become replaced with a high pitched squeal , and may hard lock your computer . either way this can only be corrected by rebooting . check out the forums before buying any creative labs products . buyer beware !
0	received my camera today ( 05/22 ) and all items are not in the box . i am missing hand strap , ni-mh batteries , battery charger and cradle adapter . worse part is i did receive a usb cable but it is not the right size and does n't fit . this is very frustrating . how do i get the missing items
0	works fine on windows xp , but does not work well with linux . i 've been using linux for at least 10 years and compiling my own kernels for most of that time , and still had issues getting this card to run under linux . my built in 10/100 nic was much faster than this card would go . ended up getting an intel gigabit card that , of course , works with no issues . save yourself some headaches and stay away from this card if it is destined for a linux box .
0	this product does not hold the smaller ipods well at all , only should be bought by people with the bigger model ipods .
0	soon parted ... . very disapointed , bad design , not for the gym which is what i bought them for.. sound is ok , not wonderful ... wish i would have read these reviews before i spent the $ 100 .
1	this is a great value for money and it is very silent and soen not get hot . it is also silent and convenient . it is more flexible with the fat 32 format it comes in but i preferred the ntfs file format whice is safer and more stable . it was no problem to reformat to ntfs
0	what a crock as it looks like everyone else got good product and good service ! i got a shuffle and something happened the second time i tried to load music to make it not even play . i took it to the apple store in mall of america ( minneapolis , mn ) and they claimed to know there was an issue and claimed to have fixxed it . i go back home ( ok ) and it still does not work . apple said for $ 113 they 'll fix . gee thanks ! i 'll be looking at another brand ! apple stinks
0	our company bought two of this model in 2005 for our new branch office . after we set them up , it works just fine . we did n't use any of the advanced features at that time . after reading the user 's guide and online forum at the linksys web site , we found out that there are a battery inside the router that is not user replaceable . you need to send it in for replacement . sure enough , we now have two routers that ca n't retain any configuration settings . they all reset to factary default all of a sudden , one after 1 year , the other after 1 and half year . also note , we updated one of the router to newest firmware , which prevents any kind of connection from the internet . needless to say , my boss is really crossed with me because i was the one recommend the model
0	does not work with non-apple base stations ! i had a powermac g5 . i was told by apple retail store clerks it will work any wireless g access points . but no ! at my house my pc can see no less than 6 wireless ap 's ( some from neighbors , one mine ) . but this airport card can only see one ( which is an apple airport station ) ! tried everything ( googled , set encryption modes , slow downed my linksys wap tranfering bitrate to 2mbps etc ... ) and no luck . returning it tomorrow
0	i recently bought my second of these . the first had a digital tuner . you had to get used to the feel . after about a year of use , one earphone went out . the one i just bought has an analogue tuner , and it is extremely hard to get any station other than the very high-powered pop ( and around here , country ) stations . the tuner requires extremely small movements to move way up the dial . i ca n't believe sony is charging $ 40.00 for this cheap piece of junk
1	this product work perfectly in the epson printer ! the quality of printing is great !
0	this device is much bulkier than it needs to be . but an even worse offence is that the device can not control the ipod . the ipod plugs in to the back , and you have to turn the unit around to reach the back to operate the ipod . it is the most ridiculous thing when you have turned off the power to the video unit ; then turn it around and find that the ipod is still playing and will continue playing forever unless you turn that off too
0	my first two black 15 cartridges worked pretty well in my hp deskjet 3820 then the third one started to indicate low fluid level and stopped printing . i replaced it with a new cartridges but it refused to work at all . while repeatingly trying to reinstall it as tech support suggested , the etch tore . when examing the inside of the printer , i found that black ink had splattered around inside the mechanism area indicating a leakage . the next new cartridge would not work either . $ $ wasted . tech support said to have the printer repaired -- ya sure ( after only one year of moderate home use and the warantee had ran out ) . printer repair would cost me more a new one
0	i bought one of these when i bought my macbook to keep it in pristine condition , just a few months ago . i just popped it off to clear out a little bit of debris that got caught between the cover and the macbook and find that all along the cover has been scratching my macbook . they should at least have had the foresight to make the plastic in contact with the macbook of a softer material , or created a design where it wo n't rub against the laptop . really stupid design . it may have protected against some very minor scratches , but likely i 'm worse off for using this cover ( scratches on the outside of the cover are more evenly dispersed than those now on the macbook but both are of similar severity ) . i do n't think in the long run it was worth $ 40 , and i feel very misled by the marketing for this cover . given the choice again i would have either gone for another brand or just saved my money
1	great product that works exactly as described . i have not used this as a stand-alone label maker ; i 've only used it with my computer . the software is fairly easy to use , and it will pull data from an excel spreadsheet , which is a definite plus . i had a spreadsheet of over 300 items for which i needed to make labels , and linking to the excel doc made the process very quick and convenient . the only complaint i have is that the tape for the label maker is rather pricey . i spent $ 40 on the label maker , and so far i 've spent $ 60 on tape
0	there is absolutley nothing wrong with the car charger . it works fine . however the fm transmitter has 2 problems for me . 1 -- the connector is not long enough to connect through many of the protective cases made for zune so you have to take it out of the case . 2 -- the signal is very weak and did not work for me in either of my cars . i ended up buyin a cassette adapter which worked much better and there was a 100 % better sound quality
1	i bought this mouse about three months ago , and i love it . it works on every surface , and the scroller works well too . the only complaint i have is that the cord is rather short ( about 2.5 feet long ) , and it plugs into the left-hand side of my laptop , which means that i only have about a foot to work with . although , i think that complaint can be shared equally with the dell people for putting the usb port on the left ( good deal for the left-handed population , i guess ) . some people have complained about the wind-up function for the cord getting tangled , but i have n't had any problems with that
0	the epson r2400 is a purely photo printer . be sure to understand this before you buy . so if you are planning to have one printer and think this is it . . . think again . the k3 inks are not compatible with plain paper and any documents you print on plain paper are horribly color shifted and distorted . it took three calls to epson and replacing the icc profile before they would finally admit that the problem was the k3 ink compatibility with the plain paper . all the magazines raved about the black and white printing quality . not . at least not on premium quality photo paper . perhaps in some of the more expensive matt papers . i saw very little improvement over my epson r320 . now if you are going to use it strictly for a photo printer then this is very nice printer . the biggest drawback is you will not find the ink cartridges at any major store such as staples . the in stock ink guarantee there does not apply to items not carried in the strore . this is hint # 1 . hint # 2 if you run out of ink on a weekend and need to have something for monday you are sol . the only option you have is to order the ink online . trust amazon as they can find and deliver . however if for some reason your lucky enough to have a large pro photo store near bye they may have the cartridges . cartridges certainly dont last very long and at $ 12- $ 15 each with eight of them your burning $ 100- $ 125 a set . bulk ink tanks are coming out but i doubt the k3 inks will be imitated . if you can stand ordering everything online and are only looking for a great photo printer than this may be just the ticket for you . however at $ 850 i fully expected to be able to print documents with pictures on plain paper . i have n't been happy with this printer and i plan to replace it soon . amazon 's being able to locate and ship the ink is the only reason its still here .
0	despite what the belkin folk told me over the phone , this does not work on a mac
1	this product worked very well , and was easy to hook up . for my use i had 3 video game systems using component video optical audio , and the switching was very quick . i replaced separate manual switchers for toslink component , and am happy with this product
0	i bought this receiver to use as a preamp in my system . i based my decision on information as stated on the pioneer web site , and the attractive price compared to some of the other options i considered . this receiver does have a number of good features , but has one serious flaw . it will not display on screen status messages for daily operations , like volume and sound mode , unless you have a pioneer display , and run another special cable from the receiver to the tv ( as a side note , pioneer needs to understand we want to run less cables to our display ) . that means you only get to see the simple set-up screen on your non-pioneer tv , which you will probably use when you first set up the receiver , and very infrequently after that . ( the set-up menu lets you set things like assignable inputs , and audio calibtraion . ) sounds like a small deal , but in many home theaters , including mine , the electronics are not in the line of site ( mine are in a closet just outside the theater with an infrared repeater system controlling everything . ) this not uncommon , many have thier electronics isolated like me or behind cabninet doors , and it means i have no idea what the volume is , what sound mode i am using , or anything beyond the set-up menu unless i go into the closet . bad , bad , bad ! this seems to be a marketing ploy by pioneer to get you to buy pioneer tv 's and projectors , and it is beyond stupid . if this was not the case i would rate this receiver much higher , but it is a serious flaw . it makes using this unit extremely tedious and difficult . this limitation also means , if you have mulitple displays , i have a plasma tv and projector in my theater , you need to run thier special cable to both displays , and both have to be pioneer . again , i have to say bad , bad , bad ! the other features are as stated on the pioneer website , but they are lying when they say this unit has on screen display , and this will be a major drawback for users that do not have the receiver in the line of site when using thier systems , unless they have a pioneer display with sr+ . ( oh yeah , your pioneer display has to be also be equipped with sr+ , thier way of linking the two units . if your pioneer display is not equipped with sr+ , you are again out of luck . did i mention this is bad ? ! ) 25 feb 2007 - addition to reveiw : i called onecall and they will take unit back , but at 15 % restocking fee , plus paying for shipping both ways . while onecall really did nothing wrong ( pioneer is lying about the osd ! ) , it is one of thier vendors and not the customer 's fault either and the customer should not pay for this kind of fraud . buyer beware from onecall , thier customer service on this one was not good
0	i purchased this cable and the pins were weak and clumsy . i could not even plug it in and one of the pins broke . i threw it away . it is a piece of junk
0	i know that everyone else seems to love this , so perhaps my complaint is more about apple in general . my ipod mini ( pink ) is a lemon . the battery has never worked properly . it takes longer to charge than to discharge , and my current playing time per charge ( no changing settings , not backlighting , nothing but hitting play and waiting till the battery dies ) is about 2 hours . apple will gladly sell me a new ( $ 70 ) battery , but other than that tough . it is apparently my fault thet they 're selling shoddy products . i 'm not saying do n't buy it . there are n't realistically any better choices out there than the ipod , but buy it when you have a week to sit around and evaluate it and when they get around to opening a store near you . as for me , i think i 'm going to dig out my old discman
0	the buttons do n't have that clicky button feel , so you press and you 're like `` did it go ? '' ... the labels are hard to read , icons take a little figuring out . honestly i use it for turning on/off , and if i want to do anything else i go up to the ihome to adjust it .
1	i have bought this for about 8pp in my office for their black and white desktop printer . so far not one problem . the toner is long-lasting and affordable . great quality- small desktop footprint . does a great job with envelopes , labels and even light cardstock . i would highly reccommend to anyone
1	i just purchased this item two days ago ( thurs . ) today ( sat . ) i removed my 160gb seagate hhd from my kingwin enclosure and installed it in this one . installation was not a problem although the molex connector seems to be a tight fit and is almost touching the fan . fan noise does not seem to be a problem yet . i used the firewire connection instead of usb and the drive access is much faster than it was with the usb connection on the other enclosure . the price is a little steep compared to others but i got a generous rebate offer with my purchase . although the case is plastic ( my other one was aluminum and plastic ) i wo n't be moving mine around so that wo n't be an issue
1	i , like many other people that have written reviews here , researched the purchase of an mp3 player in great detail . other members of my family own ipods , and that is the direction that i was heading until i did a massive amount of research . if you want to rip the thousands of songs that you already own on cd , this is the unit that you want . ipod will not let you download your own songs , i did not know that until after i purchased this player ( thankfully ) . this unit was the highest rated unit by far that i was able to scour the internet for . if this is your first purchase of an mp3 player ( like mine ) buy this one , no questions asked . do not worry about trying to buy $ 80 ear buds the sound from the ear buds that come with the player is unreal . crisp , clear , awsome base and i have only turned up the player to 23 on the volume it goes up to 40 . i can not hear the home stereo that my wife is listening to or my kids that are running around the house playing . i received this player in the mail today at 5:30 when i got home from work and by 6:35 i have transfered the 114 artists folders ( about 4,000+ songs ) that i had ripped on my computer last week ( about 35 to 40 minutes to transfer the music to the staging folder and then to the player ) . i would recomend buying the cradle , it helps in standing it up on the desk or over the stereo , which i plan to do to play all my music on my outdoor speakers by the pool . absolutley buy this unit . i have only messed wit it for a couple of hours and i have a high performance expectation and it has met it
1	within about 12 seconds of opening the box i was listening to my ipod on my home stereo . wires are well made . there may be cheaper options that work as well but these will last forever
1	this is about the only mouse i buy , have gone through a couple of them in the past few years . i just ca n't see spending alot of money on something thats going to naturally wear out . this model is one that i find comfortable for the hand and durable in the using . if you want a good , reliable , comfortable mouse , this logitech is a good choice
0	i was expecting at least a degree worth of difference , it did not help at all ! absolute waste of 50 dollars
1	speakers give good sound quality and are small and unnoticeable at a good price all the things i was looking for in speake
0	easy to set up and worked great for 2 months then it just stopped working . horrible customer service ! will never buy from this company again !
1	i ordered this for my teenage daughter for christmas and she loves it . the sound is great and the amplifier works well . for the price it plays like a much more expensive instrument . i recommend this to any new player wanting to learn the guitar
1	i gave this 5 stars only because it serves its purpose well . it 's just a basic mouse pad , but the price is excellent ! !
0	i have had a canon g2 since 2002 . i used to use viking 128 mb cf cards and had no problem . in october 2004 , i bought one viking cf512m 512mb cf card from amazon . i did not use it until this summer . after i had taken 20 more photos and reviewed , i immediately found a few images corrupted . no matter how i tried , e.g . format the cf before use , there were alway corrupted images . i wonder if i can return the defect cf card and get a replacement from amazon or from manufacturer ? sherwood l.a. count
0	this home theater package , despite being attractively priced considering its apparent functionality , is ultimately very disappointing . i 'm new to hdtv and hdmi so i did n't know as much as i needed in order to make a fully informed decision . i have a sony bravia xbr3 , oppo upconverting dvd player , scientific atlanta hd box and nintendo wii game console . this unit only offers pass-through video , so you have to have separate video connections from the receiver to the tv for each type of input ( hdmi , component , etc. ) . for the price difference between this and other receivers that will convert to a single connection , you 'll pay in extra cabling costs . the hdmi on this unit carries video only - no sound - so you have to have separate cabling to carry audio from your dvd or cable to the receiver , and then from the receiver to your tv . again , major inconvenience and lots of additional connections . the manual for this unit is beyond terrible . i 'm astounded that an international consumer electronics firm like sony would provide a manual as difficult to use and just indirect as this one . for example , there was a hum when watching tv that turned out was because the speakers while looking identical are not - some are shielded and some are n't . nothing in the manual about this . there are probably just enough hdmi and component connections for the basic user like myself . plus side is that there is no dvd player with this , so i can use my own . given a chance to do this again , i would spend a little extra on a unit that converts signals to a single output
1	good price . just not sure it is needed
1	i read some of the reviews about installation issues and they concerned me initially . but , when it came time to get the printer up and running on my wireless network , there really were n't any issues . just following the directions ( and avoiding the easysecure option ) worked fine . i would highly recommend this printer-the quality of the printing is excellent , the feature/function set is quite high for a moderate price , and it 's a great home/office printer that has lots to offer .
1	you really ca n't go wrong with this one . not great response but what do you expect for less than $ 300 ? on the other hand , the possibilities for this surround system are endless . want something just for the effects to complilment your bedroom wide screen ? how about using it for a dedicated gaming sound system , ( this is how my daughter has it configured ) . it 's our second one . first one died as a result of recent electrical storm , ( yes the circuit was 'protected ' , but so what ) . could n't be happier for the investment
1	i looked at all the different cases for my new ipod with video , and the reviews kept pointing me back to this case . so i bought it . it exceeds my expectations . it 's fantastic . my ipod is now completely contained and scratchproof . this helps when down the road i might want to sell it . the screen cover is perfectly clear and seems very durable . i like the fact that it 's held off of the ipod 's screen so it wo n't scratch . the clickwheel is easily usable , actually more so because of the circle around it . i bought the case on amazon from sonicswap and am astounded at how fast i got it . 2 days ! amazing . this case is for the 60gb ipod with video . it clearly says that in the title ; not sure how that one reviewer got confused about that . do n't hesitate . this is the case
0	very poor design..would never recommend this product . the connection is so flaky , you will end up wasting lot of time
1	i bought a zen 30g mp3 player and could not stand the earbuds they came with . they hurt so much that i used head phones until these v-moda earbuds came in . they are awesome . the fit is so comfortable and the sound it wonderful . i got them on sale for less than they are running right now on amazon , so i feel pretty good about the purchase . =
0	syntax clearly states that their warranty is only good for the origninal purchaser . i got my daughter one as a gift , gave it to her bran new , in the factory sealed box and syntax refuses to honor the warranty , ( and yes i calld everywere and tried everything ) .
1	this is my first experience with hdtv and wide screen . this 46 '' sony tv is excellent with hd programs ; with regular broadcasts , it is a bit muddy , but that is the fault of the signal , not the tv . i am very pleased with the overall quality of the set . i had the set professionally installed and set up , and i am sure glad i did : install and set up are not for amateurs like me ; if anything ever happens , i will be hard pressed to reset things . sony 's instruction manuals are not that great
0	i purchased the md781 + md71 expansion phone after briefly having its predecessor the md681 . i really like the md681 but i could never locate one of its expansion handsets ( everyone online/offline was constantly out of stock ) . overall i 'm disappointed with this new model and after two weeks of use i am already looking for another phone . handheld phones : i like them more than any other phone i 've tried . unlike most phones these days they 're big and have a very solid feel to them ... it 's just easier to hold onto a phone like this for a longer conversation . the buttons are a nice size and easy to use . the hands free/speak phone on the handheld works well . with one person on a handheld line the sound is pretty good , but with two people on handsets you get significant background noise that is so bad it hurts your ear and it 's hard to hear the person on the other end of the conversation . the shared phonebook is a terrific idea but it could have been done better . it 's a few clicks and slow to access ... almost as quick to have the old rolodex on hand ... or copy the number to the local units phonebook ... which defeats the purpose . as for the answer machine : once you play messages you no longer have a visible indicator of how many messages , if any , are in the system ( is it just me or is that poor design ) , so if you listen to messages when you partner is n't around you need to leave a note for them to check messages . the quality of voice messages is a bit grainy . i also like how the handset docked in the older m681 ; it laid on the base so you had the option of wall mounting the base ... the md781 sits up on the base like some sort of obelisk .
1	i installed this antenna in my pawn shop where we keep most of our electronics running all day . i could never get good reception with standard antennas and now this single antenna does the job better than any i have ever seen . keep in mind that i have a full surveillance systen , alarm syster , phone system , 20 home stereos , a dozen or more computers and on and on . the terk fm-50 has exceeded my expectations . thanks , joel dba pawn-plus
0	pros : cheap cons : bad video quality . moving diagonal lines are clearly visible
0	i loved this phone , but after only a few weeks the button is stuck and the phone ca n't pick up . i want it fixed but do n't know how
0	i bought the ear buds to replace the ones that came with my ipod . i used it for about fifteen minutes and then the left earbud would not transmit any sound . sending these ones back . i must say that the earbuds kept outside sound out very well ( much to my mom 's dismay , she could n't fuss at me : -p ) . oh well .
0	terrible user interface - you must page through tons of cryptic menus to set basic features . pulls multiple papers through , so you must start again . is a g3 , which you would think would be compatible with earlier non-g3 fax machines - wrong - so you ca n't fax to 75 % of the community that has a non g3 unit ! i thought i was buying quality from canon when i paid $ 250 for this hunk of junk ! the cheap brother and hp 's at my work never have these problems and are easier to use , and much less expensive . save your money and save the headaches ! sorry canon , this product was a disaster
1	i am very pleased with the brother p-tough ql-500 . the printing lables are a good price for the quantity you get .
0	i 've had my micro for over a year now , and when it worked , i loved it ! however , i 'm having the notorious ear phone jack issue ; the sound is output in layers , and i am constantly trying to `` reposition '' my headphones to get full sound . my husband called creative labs for assistance , and he was told that it would cost him [ ... ] per month for a `` customer service subscription . '' after reading these reviews , it seems we 'd be paying creative labs [ ... ] so that they could tell us there 's nothing they can ( or will ) do . next brand , please ...
1	the only thing i do n't like about it , is the scanning area is upside down where most scanners you open the lid and put your photo or document close to you this scanner you have to put it all the way to the back of the scanner so you have to open the lid all the way . also the film tray shows on some of my documents as well you would think they would give you something to cover the film tray when not in use . i did like the way xp found this scanner right away with no disks or software . i have a cannon scanner i just got a few months ago but it is limited because it is not compatible with xp with out cannons software , the cannon was so bad that i purchased this one all in all i like it does a great job glad they still make just scanners for people who use laser printers
1	this card , using via 's superb envy24 ht chipset , is a huge improvement over my realtek and via envy24ht-s based cards . everything sounds better . my old audigy 2 platinum ( which i think i shall melt ) did better in 3d games , but only slightly . since this card does n't snap , crackle , and pop like the creative cards do , i 'll venture to say that it actually does make games better , since there are no weird noises distracting from the feel of the game . pros : * very high audio sampling rates , allowing for incredibly good audio production ; warm , rich , warm bass all the way up to crystal clear highs . * no crackling , popping , or hissing ! a real joy after pulling my hair out for years trying to figure out why creative labs cards keep doing this . * well-maintained , solid drivers . * supports eax 2.0 * excellent asio support . cons : * no hardware support for directsound ; however , if your machine is faster than about 1ghz , you probably wo n't notice the difference . benchmark your results on a machine made in the last three years and you 'll find that no hardware directsound acceleration amounts to *less* than a 1 % difference in speed . * only supports up to eax 2.0 , due to creative labs refusing to license the technology . sound difference is minimal , though
0	i 'm usually a big linksys supporter . this is an exception . this device is a joke . not a very funny one . the first thing i was told when i called for support was it most likely would n't work with my printer ( canon mp950 ) . i spent several hours trying to get a linksys router to see this thing with online support . do n't waste your time
1	radio reception in my apartment is terrible . i have purchased a few indoor antennas , even a different terk model , but none of them helped very much . i had to move the antenna around to different areas for different stations , and my digital fm radio only received one digital channel . this unit , however , works great . i get every station i want , and the digital fm works great . the only thing i would mention is that the antenna casing is bulky , so if you 're concerned about asthetics you 'll have to figure out where you can conceal it . also , i did n't get any additional benefit from the amplifier , but the antenna worked so well that i did n't need it
