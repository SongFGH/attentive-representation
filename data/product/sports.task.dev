0	we know strollers ! ! this is our 5th stroller over 4 kids . we decided to try a dually . pros : plenty of room for 2 children both about 25 pounds . `` cute '' cons : we 're reviewing what we consider to be an expensive stroller . in our opinion the added expense should n't equal just an extra seat , but better design and higher quality . 1 ) while the dimensions are listed in the description , the relative size to every day objects are not discussed . objects , like say , doors . this stroller wo n't fit through 90 % of the doors in the world . you basically had better only expect that it go through the front door of your house or plan on parking it in the garage next to your suburban . the doorway must be a 3'0 door ( 36 inches wide ) . that 's usually only your front door . forget about pushing into or out of any interior doorways which are generally much smaller . 2 ) the straps are awful . again , our 4th stroller . worse one of all . incredibly , incredibly difficult to use . i 'm actually flabergasted at how difficult the straps are . despite having tightened them up as tight as possible , the two year old was out in under 10 minutes ( once she decided to be out ) . 3 ) impossible to allow the children to sit up . again , adjusting the straps to the utmost , the angle of the backrest remains extremly steep . perhaps to counter balance the lack of effective straps ? 4 ) hand brake is setup for the left hand . appears to be reversible if you want to work on it . 5 ) hood can not be lowered to cover front of children . if say , you are walking into the sun ( morn or evening ) , the kids are completely exposed . conclusion : very frustrating buy . would n't recommend it at all
1	as a hobbyist woodworker who works primarily with hand tools , i 've had to learn how to put a razor edge on things like plane blades and chisels . while i 've managed to master that skill ( can shave hair off my arm with these tools ) , putting a sharp edge on my kitchen knives has been a nightmare . i 've tried numerous methods , none of which has worked well . about a year ago , i puchased the spyderco sharpening kit . read the manual , watched the dvd , put my kitchen knives to it , and ... ... ended up with pretty dull knives . frustrated , i put this kit in a kitchen drawer . fast-forward to last week . the kitchen knives are dull again , and none of my sharpening systems work on the knives . so , i pulled out the spyderco again and gave it another try . this time , i tried sharpening my serrated bread knife . after just a few strokes , it was good as new . so , i tried it on the straight knives again , but only got a modest increase in sharpness . now convinced that some of my kitchen knives are made from inferior stainless steel , i tried sharpening my swiss army knife . again , after a few stokes on the sharpmaker , i had a wicked sharp knife . i was down in the workshop today , sharping my plane blades and chisels . the last plane blade to sharpen was for a scrub plane ... the blade on these is very convex , so sharping it is always a challenge . fortunately , it does not need to be super sharp , and never has been . the sharpmaker was sitting out , so i said `` what the heck '' , and gave the scrub plane 's blade a few freehand strokes on the sharpmaker ... no sharpening jig to hold the blade like i normally use . for fun , i tried to shave hair off my arms ... .and it worked ! i could n't believe it ... this sharpmaker makes sharpening too easy ! it 's american-made , very well thought-out , and works amazingly well when your blades are n't made of junk steel . what more could you ask for ?
1	use the xl most every day and find that it does a fairly good job for what it is supposed to do . only use it about ten minents at a time since i am 72 i dont overdue it . can see the difference in my abdomen already
1	just the perfect cap ! . it fits like no other swimming cap . it wo n't pull you hair when removing it , neither will slip a bit from your head after swimming several laps or flip turning . very resistant material , and a great finish . awesome colors !
0	small ... very small kit , not as advertised . every item needs expensive batteries
1	its a good sword i put it through my room door no prob
1	these are exactly what they are advertised to be . i thoroughly enjoy using them
1	i looked at many different variations of swiss army knife before i decided on this one . i could n't be happier ! this has an excellent variety of tools for everyday jobs ( the screwdriver heads , the small blade , the scissors ) , and it 's great for outdoor use at picnics , camping , or canoeing ( the saw blade , the large knife , the toothpick ) . there are still a few tools i have n't used , but overall , this is one of the best mixes of tools for the money
1	great flooring system . easy to assemble and very strong . expensive but worth it
1	this has been used by our family forever ! we use it on burns , diaper rashes , cuts on our animals , and just about any type of open wound -- it works wonders ! plus , this trial-like size makes it perfect for the diaper bag , purse , drawer , or first aide kit
1	extra clips are neccessary ! the gun goes through ammo and the clip only holds about 45 rds
1	a friend who is a successful competition mountain bike rider asked me to weigh the blackburn airfix after i bought it . he has had many occasions where his chain has broken , or his tires have punctured , so he wanted to compare the weight of the blackburn versus the weight of all the individual tools he carried when he rides . the airfix weighed in at about 245 grams - about 8 ounces - and his tools , including inflator , tire levers , hex wrenches and chain tool ( all included in the airfix ) tipped the scales at 337 grams - about 11 ounces . i suppose that a multitool may not be as convenient to use as individual tools , but for handiness , this seems hard to beat . the blackburn lifetime/no-questions-asked guarantee is also very attractive . so while i have yet had to put this tool into action with either my trek 2200zr or my trek 6000 , in a world where every ounce of weight is a heavy concern , pardon the pun , i imagine i have made a wise purchase
0	maybe the s120 will work for you , but it was nothing but trouble for me . i bought it because of the great features and price , but returned it because of all the problems : 1 ) the manual is anything but friendly , e.g . after completing the 11 steps to set the date you are then told that there 's a short cut . thanks . 2 ) after spending much more than an hour with the manual just to get the basic settings in , i 'm off to exercise . great start , the reading is my usual pulse around 55 , then it drops out to 0 . ok , maybe the contacts are too dry , so i wet them . off i go again and the pulse rate measures 204 then to 0 . ok , maybe the chest strap is positioned poorly . different position , same result -- measured pulse rates all over the map . i decide to forget what the monitor records and finish my exercise . final result -- i got periods of reasonable heart rates , but lots of time the values were either 0 or over 190 . the next day i try again with the same result -- drop outs and then sky high readings . it went back later that day
0	the compass is wholly unreliable . the light button turns on in your bag , thus draining the battery . one of my worst amazon purchases
0	i bought this gloves so i would n't have to wrap my hands to protect my wrists everytime i went for a bag workout . one reviewer is clearly confused . they said that there was a metal bar in the glove to prevent fatigue in your hand . turns out there is no metal bar in it , but instead it was plastic or something similar . then when using these gloves on my 100 pound punching bag i wound up with blood blisters all over my knuckles . this has never happened to me before and i have been working out with punching bags for over 15 years . yeah sure you might get some skin torn off from your hands rubbing on the inside of the leather everlast gloves the first couple weeks you use them but blood blisters on your knuckles after your knuckles are use to those kinds of blows for years . another thing i noticed about these gloves is they wear out fast if you constantly use them on punching bags . they get to the point to where you feel like there is no padding in them . gave these gloves 2 stars since i liked the idea of being able to wrap these gloves on and go to work . but they need to be greatly improved upon .
1	we got this for our son . he loves it ! ! ! ca n't hardly reach the pedals but that dont stop him . stylish and well built , i think it should last a long time . great product , would recomend to anyone ! !
1	this is a great exercise ball . it is great in helping your body tone up by balancing yourself using the ball with various floor routines . let me tell you ! ! ! it is very hard to balance yourself on this ball and i can really feel my muscles working out . it helps strengthen your muscles and gives you better balance and flexibility . this is a great product ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	i ordered a wobble balance board from everyting fitness and it came from karate depot and does n't even look like the product i ordered . i only give 1 star , because i ca n't give zero starts
1	i go to anime expos alot . and to to be honest this sword aint half bad . unlike its 67 ' brother its only 37 ' but its a whole lot better to wield . combat ready , very sturdy and made in china . i notice some swords made in pakistan ! and they usually end up breaking so this swords worth the buy if your a bleach fan and if you wan na save some cash
0	the ski rack is attached to the thule bars by a plastic connector which must be spread almost to the breaking point to wrap around the bar . the old 724 had metal connectors . making them plastic is insane . these connectors will break over time . additionally , a thief could simple steal your skis by grabbing the rack and twisting it thereby breaking the plastic connectors .
0	i really wanted to like this lantern . it is a nice size and is nicely made at a great price , but the light output is pathetic . the package gives the impression that there are 4 leds in it , but i find that doubtful . the light output is no better than the output from a tiny key fob princeton tec or photon . in fact , i think you could read a map , or a book , play cards , or follow a trail , more easily with one of the tiny key fob lights . i 'm returning mine .
0	billy is great , full of energy and enthusiam . i get great results from his workout much better than any other instructor . my family get great results from his workout . his customer service rep were helpful . however , i strongly , strongly recommend ordering your taebo products through amazon . i 've been doing business with amazon many years and have placed over 150 orders . i never , never once had any problems with my orders at amazon . when i had questions , it 's amazing at not only how quick amazon will reply but will give a long thorough and kind explanation . because they reply within a day and take so much time with the response , it shows they truly care for you and want to give you the best service possible . i 've never found customer service of this very high and rare quality . in november of 2005 , after ordering the billy bands from the official billy bank 's website . i was sent a package , without my permission from the company that contained billy 's energy formula supplements . it was a 14 day delayed bill for 31.85 . i was upset this was sent without me knowing but here 's the worse part . i contacted customer service , a gentleman told me do n't worry you have n't been billed just send us back the package and we 'll credit you $ 5 into your account for the shipping , packaging , and mailing cost you pay out of your own pocket to have the items sent back . within a few days i send the product i never requested back . twice by phone and once by email from 3 different cust rep i was told i would receive a $ 5 credit to my bank account within 7 to 10 days . i was already upset about this matter but it was n't that big of a concern . however , about 2 weeks well over 10 days i never received the $ 5 credit to my account . but there was a charge taken from their company without my permisson or authorization from my own personal bank account for $ 8.97 . a few days later the $ 8.97 was put back into my account . when i contacted the company this is their reply : thank you for your recent e-mail . we apologize for the inconvenience . our records show that your vitamin shipment was on a 14 day delay billing cycle ( i sent the item i never wanted back in 7 days not over the 14 day limit ) . this means that when the charges actually went through , you were only charged for a small portion of the amount that showed on the invoice ( i kept the copy and nowhere on the invoice is this stated ) . you received a credit for the shipping and handling plus 5.00 dollars to ship it back too . this means , when the charge for the vitamins actually went through you were only charged for 8.97 . this is also the refund that you have received , the amount paid ( again since the item was sent back within 14 days i should n't have been charged and nowhere on the invoice is this stated that i would only be charged a small portion ) . so basically they sent me a product i never requested . told me they would give me some money to have the product sent back . took money from my bank account without me knowing and paid me back with my own money they stolen . to sum it up , do business with amazon !
1	the item is nice , but $ 15 for shipping on each blade is outrageous . i know that if you shipped two of them together , it would n't cost $ 15 for both of them , let alone separately . and everyone wonders why their items are so cheap..
0	i am surprised this bike has gotten good reviews ; i am quite diappointed . i purchased this bike after looking at many mountain bikes and decided that this seemed to be a good buy . however , it turned out not to be so . first of all , the bike is really ugly with its white and brownish colors , though i suppose that 's a personal issue . as for performance , this bike is not worth its stated price of over $ 200 , so do n't think you are getting some great deal . the suspension leaves something to be desired and it seems to be shifting funny . i am not an expert on bikes , but i 'm pretty sure shifting is supposed to be a little smoother than this . also , after about a week , i noticed a strange noise coming from the bike as i peddled . it 's hard to explain ... almost like something is out of place . so again , the bike is not worth this price . perhaps if it were being sold for around $ 100 it would be a decent deal
0	not what i expected . this bench is ok for a petite woman , not suitable for a man or anyone over 5 feet tall ...
1	this is the first product i 've ever bought to work out my forearm , so i ca n't compare it to anything else ... but i will say it does work . i 've noticed a strength increase in my forearm in just a month of using it . it 's comfortable and easy to use . i would like the highest resistance to be a little harder , though
0	despite charging the flashlight for the required 15 hours , the light failed to shine for more than 5 minutes . also during those lackluster minutes of operation , the emanating light seemed to be nowhere near the advertised 1 million candle power
1	i would just like to tell everyone who did n't understand the use of this item ... they are n't actually anti-gravity boots ! they are used for a type of exercise called inversion where you put the boots on and attatch them to a bar hanging either from a wall or cieling , so in other words , you hang upside down with these boots while attatched to a bar . they are in no way meant to make you float , or fly , or anything else that can only be found in sci-fi magazines..
0	when i purchased this item i got the impression that the kit ( looking at the picture ) included everything but the gazebo - which is the frame . you should be more specific and mention that the kit is just the screen around the frame and the top cover was not part of the kit . i need the top part of the gazebo more than the screen around it . the title of this item should say : `` gazebo screen '' and not `` gazebo screen kit '' ... unhappy custome
1	yes ... ... ... i like it , after using for 2 weeks , my fingers were strong . good thing is that this exercise helps in smooth blood flowing in your body
0	i bought a mesh chair that looked very similar to this and loved it , so i thought i might like the alps chair too . i was wrong . it 's very light weight , but it 's a lot longer than my other chairs , which made it more difficult to carry and transport . the arms are attached to the seat with cheap plastic fittings , one of which broke the first time i used the chair . the next day , three of the support bars broke completely apart at the rivet points , throwing me to the ground and rendering the chair completely useless . save your money on this one
0	had to return the first one due to non-functioning thermo and fault compass . small is nice for hanging it on keys or pack , but the same smallness makes it a little hard to opwerate one handed . i also have a brunton compass that fits the hajnd much nicer . we 'll see how long the 2nd one lasts
0	i ditto the previous reviewer ... i thought these seats were adjustable , was i wrong , there is only 1 position and that is practically laying down.. suck
1	my daughter is 2 1/2 years old , 32 lbs . and i wanted to get back into jogging . after reviewing many strollers i decided on this one for it 's price and features ( swivel front tire , rubber tires , tray for myself and my daughter-snacks and juice keep her from getting antsy on my runs ) . i was n't sure if she would be too big for a jogging stroller but she fits very comfortably in this one and has n't complained during any of my runs . it handles great too ! ! my only complaint is that i have not found it as easy as other reviews say it is to fold up . i have a suv so it has not been a problem , but i must say for me it does not fold flat at all and i am not sure it would fit into a trunk . but , most reviews have have said it folds easy . not sure what i am missing , but..
0	i would not recommend this product unless you absolutely can not afford to spend any more money . for around $ 60 , you could get the `` world industries m.a.d . balance board '' and get a much better looking and more durable product . or you could spend around $ 80 and get a bongo board . if you really want the best and have the money for it , you could spend about $ 120 and get an indo board . the zoomboard that i received was green and blue . unfortunately , it looks garish , but a child may like the look of this . in addition to the garish coloring scheme , the board has a rough sandy underside . this is good because it allows the board to better grip the rolling tube . however , after a couple weeks of using it ( five days each week for 30 minute sessions with my 140 lbs . frame ) , the tube develops craters from the sand and wears down . then again , if you wait it out , the sand eventually will slough off of the board itself and you wo n't have to worry about wearing down your rolling tube . but the gripping surface will be compromised . if you try using this on a hard floor and not carpeting , the rolling tube starts to move less fluidly than before . make sure there are no grains , pebbles , or hard materials on the surface you are practicing on because they can easily ruin your rolling tube . this may be a failing of boards that use a wood rolling tube . overall , this board is fun , but not great quality . if you absolutely can not afford $ 10 more to purchase a much better product , then buy this board and use it sparingly on a carpet to get a long life out of it . if you can afford more , keep looking and check out the products that i mentioned above and get something that 'll actually be worth your hard-earned money
1	the suunto bike pod is easy to install in a few minutes , and worked , as advertised , paired with the suunto t3 , training effects/heart rate monitor . unlike other wireless cycling computers used in the past , the suunto bike pod does not require micro positioning on the bike and continues to send reliable signals to the suunto t3 , even in bad weather and over rough terrain . although bike pod includes provisions for mounting the suunto t3 on the handle bars , this configuration is not required for use . the suunto t3 is a wrist-worn training effects and heart rate monitor , and works fine when worn on either the left or right wrist , receiving wireless signals from the bike pod as well as the suunto heart rate transmitter worn around the chest
0	this unit is amazingly heavy given that it is mostly mesh . the poles are not super high quality and i would imagine are going to break is used a lot . i used this in some high winds and the zippers broke .
1	this product is phenomenal . it reduces if not eliminates chaffing when applied properly . it worked under my wetsuit . it works under your arms and around your neck during open water swimming . it works between your thighs or on your chest when running . it may even prevent blistering on your toes while running , but i ca n't directly confirm that . i 'd recommend reapplying every four hours
1	i feel this product provides excellent value for the occasional biker or hiker . while cycling i had filled the hydration bladder with water and ice . i also carried a 32oz bottle of gatorade in the the storage area . there was still plenty of room for snacks , keys , clothes etc . i purchased a sony portable cd player/radio . it fits nicely in a special compartment with the headphone wires coming out of a slot in the top of the pack . my radio also has a remote which is great when you do n't want to stop . the chest and waist straps hold the pack comfortably yet snugly to your body so it is not bouncing around . the one negative that would report is the bladder hook . rhis is what the bladder suspends from inside the pack . i think it should have a latch or something to hold it more securely . what i found is that when you take it off , it may slip off and then it pinches the hose which prevents drinking . i try to keep the velcro that closes that part of the pack close to the hook . this seems to help . overall though i am very pleased with my purchase .
0	i paid [ ... ] bucks for tyhis gun got it and got it ready and figured out how it works and after using it a few time si relized its flaws first its too damn small its accurcy is not bad but its velocity is utter crap and doenst do squat in heavy battles and the clip is a reduiclus system of shaking the rounds form teh clips into the spring ssystem buy this for collections and maybe for soem fun but not a good gun and it jammed after the first month and i broke it trying to fix it
0	well , they looked so cool on tv that i ordered 2 of them and i regret it . it 's awkward to get the hook back into the `` rocket '' once the bait is on . i took my son fishing with them and what we ended up doing is not launching them out of the gun/rod . we left the pod open with the bait on the hook and dropped it into the water and let it drift with the current . i 've come to find that buying cheesey little rods and reels are simply a waste of money . if you 're going to take a little one out fishing , just use your own and let them reel yours in until their big enough to handle a decent set up . the only reason i gave this 2 stars is because it was a neat idea .

1	i 've had my 1 quart stanley thermos for over 20 years now , and this is by far , no doubt about it , the best thermos ever invented . i have poured hot coffee in this thermos in the morning prior to doing field work in the dead of winter in upstate ny . after leaving the thermos literally sitting in the snow in -20 degree temperatures all day , at 5 pm the coffee was still piping hot . if you need to keep liquids hot , this is the best non-electric product out there for doing it
1	i write very few reviews , but i just wanted to share my unbelievable success with healing my cracked heels . i have fought this battle many years , with no success . i started using this stuff 3 weeks ago , along with a heel sander , and i only have a small scar that i suspect will go away . i can not believe the results ! ! ! i only wish i had taken pictures to proof the results ! ! but who wants to look at ugly cracked heels ? ? ? lol ... it works ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	bought this for my son . he loved it and played with it a lot for about a week . then the wheels broke . he was n't doing anything unusual with the board just riding it back and forth on the driveway . the wheels seemed to warp and twist making them unstable
1	expensive , but i use it for aerobic and occasional high impact exercises as well as yoga . very satisfied
1	great product . i just received my ball today . i could n't wait to work out . if i learn how to stay on it that would be saying something ! i will always recommend max-fitness
0	like you ( i 'm sure ) i saw this machine on television ( mistake number one ) and then ordered it online without ever trying it first . this machine is a joke . if you can not get your legs over your head then maybe this machine is for you . but this is not for serious users who stretch everyday . i can do more with my $ 5 stretch band from target than i can with this big heavy space-taking piece of junk . the resistance is zero , and just laughable over all . save yourself the money , and frustration - buy a lightweight no-hassle stretch band !
0	i bought this knife for my husband for a christmas gift . at first he was thrilled to get a new one . upon putting the knife on his key ring and trying to use it , he noticed that the blade opens toward the key chain , making it almost impossible ( and very uncomfortable ) to use . he had to buy another knife that opened the opposite way . he did , however , like the other features , namely the light and the pen .
0	... and buy a gps instead . i agree with previous reviewer ( dave57 ) , i would never buy a suunto again . worst than dave , i simply got caught in heavy rain during a hike and my vector was full of water , could n't even tell the time . i send it to suunto finland for repair and they say that it leaked from the housing and `` kindly '' offered a repair for 140 euros .
1	perfect , exactly what i expected and wanted . i ride to work in rain or shine or storm and was sick of the water shooting up , had it on in less then 5 min . my bike is full suspension , 26 inch wheels with that horse shoe ( u ) bar on the lower legs of the front fork and it still fit with no problem . do n't know how it would handle a crash in trees though , sits high like a dirt bike look . people ask where i got it
0	very disappointed ... it didnt play any music its own quiet difficult to squeeze ... ..
1	i used mine for two weeks snorkeling in hawaii . it is n't perfect . it does take on a little bit of water sometimes when you go below the surface , but it is n't enough to cause any problems . it is pretty easy to clear by just giving a hard quick blow . you probably wo n't find anything better
1	i just love my little parrot ! the kids on the bike trail love to hear it too
0	first of all the colors of the product at amazon pictures and the real product doese n't match . what seens to be a silver watch it is realy a white one . at the beggining everything was ok , at the end of first week the light button locked ( after a few hours i get it unlocked ) , in the second week the the battery has ended . i 'm very disappointed..
0	i bought this compass at a good price , thats about all i can say good for this product . the backlight is too dim plus the compass will not hold an accurate reading , i have to keep resetting it . i can not reccommend product
1	very nice flooring for the price . easy to put together . i use it as weight room flooring in an exercise area i have set up in my garage . if you are looking for aerobic room flooring , i would recommend buying the 20mm version
0	i got this heart rate monitor and the strap was way too small so i had to order a replacement strap when i went to change the strap the battery was dead the battery lasted only 1 week . so i had to buy 2 new batteries one for the watch and one for the chest strap and now there is a line of pixels out on the screen of the watch . i am going to get a forerunner those seem allot better . i was very disappointed with this my suunto dive computer is great this hrm sucks .
1	it is a great football but is hard to grip if you do n't have real large hands and is slippery
0	basically the title says it all . i figured for a 100 dollars i would get a nice green and that the break would add to the challenge . basically this is a poorly made toy that should n't cost more than about 20 dollars much less a hundred . like i said in the title if you want an overpriced piece of junk then you hit the jackpot with the tru-break putt 'n hazard . the only thing this is a hazard to is your wallet
1	i live in san francisco and we bike everywhere so i 'd been trying to find a new bike trailer for my 2.5 yo daughter who outgrew her front mounted baby seat . everywhere i went the trailers were priced at $ 250 plus . i was a bit skeptical about buying this instep because it was a `` no name '' brand ( wrong - it turns out that its made by schwinn ) although it was priced at about half the price on others . when i research the product i found it to be lighter than the pricier brands . it runs smooth , easy to attach/detach . i keep the stroller front wheels always mounted so that i my daughter falls asleep and i wnt to walk around she 's can continue sleeping . i recently did grocery shopping with the trailer and my daughter . it has a rear compartment that fit 3 traderjoes paper shopping bags , an additional bag in the front with my daughter , and one more on the rear basket that is mounted on my bike . i 've also taken my daughter an another of her friends ( it sits two kids ) and they loved it . overall , a very good product - although not a sleek and cute as others like the burley - but its lighter , and priced much below comparable products
1	let me start by saying that i ordered this rowing machine on april 2 and it arrived on april 5 ! i was so excited ! even though it has poor instructions on putting this machine together , it is n't impossible . the tension strap is twisted around part of the machine that needs to be unwrapped first and that is not mentioned in the instructions . also , two of the steps seem to be out of order , but i still give this product a 5 star rating . when i was in college , i used a machine like this in their exercise room and loved it . this is just like it , but i think it 's even better . i do n't have a problem with the foot holders on this machine like i did with the one at college . the quality is great for the value . i feel that i have enough resistance and that i 'm getting the workout that i 'm looking for . i use an elliptical rider first , then i get on my rower . this is now rounding out my workout and i love it ! my elliptical rider is a gym quality machine and was very expensive but worth the cost . this rower is inexpensive , but does n't feel like a cheap machine . again , i am thrilled with it . by the way , i do n't think that you can tell it in the picture , but the fan cover has holes all the way around it . when i 'm working out i can feel the breeze that it is generating . it does n't blow me away , but it 's enough to cool me off some . i hope you find the machine you 're looking for . if you 're looking to save some money and get a great workout , this may be the rower for you .
1	i purchase my total gym and though it did not give me the workout that i expected , it did help me to get firmer and leaner in a short period of time . i wish it offered more of a workout for the legs but overall , i am very happy with my gym and i use it all the time . only a 20 minute workout 3 times a week made a huge difference in the way i look
1	the bands were sent in a timely fashion and were exactly as advertised . great folks to work with . now if they could sell me some motivation to use them daily ... i 'd sure buy that too
0	i had purchased a rifle from airslat and it broke after 3 minutes of use . the quality was not good , but , the customer service of this company is the worst i have ever dealt with . it has been 2 weeks and no replacement has been shipped . i have had every excuse imaginable , first they wanted me to pay for shipping , then they wanted me to pay full price for another gun , then they said they did not have that model any longer and i would have to pay for the higher priced model . i still have not been refunded or had the item replaced . i have spent hours trying to get this taken care of with no progress . the worst customer service of all time !
1	i bought this bike for myself and i love it . i got it for half the listed price . it was originally intended as a starter to introduce myself back in to biking ( at 30+yrs old ) but i 'm going to stick with it . the other buyer with the bad experience must have gotten a bad bike . the brakes are excellent and the bike itself , including shocks , are just as sturdy as my husband 's expensive pro bike . the 24inch is perfect for me , being barely five-foot-two ; and does n't seem too juvenile in stature or in color . i highly recommend this bike
1	i did n't know what to expect , but these turned out to be very good quality . they stretch well and return to shape . they do n't feel like they are going to snap apart when you are in the middle of exercising . i was very pleased with the product . be careful , though , if you have a latex allergy . i also got excellent service from the company ! i would definitely do business with them again
1	this little device is easy to put together and easy to use . not for 'intensive ' workouts however , you can pretty much use it anyplace you 're sitting down . that could mean even while the tv is on ! like all exercise equipment , if you do n't use it you lose it
0	good points of the el-300 : powerful sharp beam ; long run per battery change ; easy on-off quick-mount clamp for anti-theft ; and , it 's a superb flashlight . i like to use it for undersink and underhood repairs , so i often borrow it from my bike . this light is intense enough to force a person to avert eyes , if the beam hits direct from even , say 40 away . cateye does caution us not to play the beam on people 's eyes . in my estimate , it is mostly a terrific flashlight , and not a great bike-mounted headlight , at least as a stand-alone . trouble is , that sharp-focused narrow beam makes you choose between two conflicting and shifting essentials : lighting your path ( you actually can with this focused power ) ; or alerting others to your presence . that would mean focusing it more toward oncoming traffic , or a tad right or left , toward peripheral traffic , depending where you are , and how the road tracks , and where cars are coming from . it 's a real attention-getter to oncoming drivers , which is great , if conditions are all just right : if you focus the lamp near level , and if the drivers are considerate enough to all approach from in front of your beam . however , traffic off to the side is another deal , since the headlight 's peripheral light suffers by contrast . i nearly took a short trip to a long rest , as a result . late on a quiet night , one flaky guy entering a major , broad secondary road i was traveling was coming fast up to his stop-sign , on a side street to my right , ahead of where i had just rounded a curve . he had a view accross broad lawns , on up the dark road behind me . after slowing just a bit , he accelerated and ran his stop sign . i was right near his position on his side-street , `` committed , '' pedaling about 15 - 17 mph , about to cross his bow . he started his right turn , gunning it , merging with unseen me . he was totally unaware of me , and was clearly of this mindset : `` no double-car-headlights , no car noise , so no car , so nuttin ' coming , so , good-to-go , so -- gun it ! '' ... all in the space of a couple seconds . moving fast , with the right-of-way , i had the el-300 blazing away bright . only , it was focused straight ahead of me , and a tad downward toward the road surface yards in front . i was dependent on the el-300 , to send ahead to the likes of him , unavoidable announcing light . it 's what i paid for ( about $ 45.00 delivered ) . i also wore a white helmet , had reflective stripes on my panniers and rack trunk , and the churning reflectors on wheels and pedals . but i know darn well all the reflectors in the world have no merit , when not bathed by headlights , and if not also bouncing back at a narrow angle to the driver 's eyes . that 's why i own a headlight . it 's why now-enlightened nj demands a bike headlight . of course , neither does a driver have any merit , when s/he rewrites the stopsign law to read `` no need to stop as long as i do n't see anyone coming . '' he nearly killed me , coming fast at me , broadside . he had regained nearly 15 or more mph as he started his right turn , still accelerating , when he spotted me and panic-braked . we were at one point about 2 feet apart , thanks to his hard braking , and my veering left on the ( luckily deserted ) dark main road . i was , for a fraction of a second , looking down at his headlights and bumper almost below me . could have reached over and touched his hood ornament . incredible experience . it was my closest call ever , and scared the hell out of me . it must 've scared the hell out of him , too . he registered his shock-and-awe with a reproaching after-fact horn blast , as he scrambled around and passed me , racing off before i could read his plate . i guess it must 've ticked him off , my scaring him with that close call . one little vehicular manslaughter can change your address awhile . equally maddening for him , after he passed the intruding cyclist with the red blinkie taillight , and the white helmet , and all the reflectors ( those alerted him , once i was his front-and-center target ) , he would had to then see that blazing headlight 's pencil-beam in his rear-view mirror . damn , nuttin ' he could blame on this creep on the bike . : - [ the el-300 simply failed me that time , as i see it , by focusing most of its light in a narrow , long-projecting beam . it was focused left of where he was looking , when i was very close to the side street he was traveling , ignoring his stop-sign . there should , from so much light energy , be some part diverted wider , closer to the bike , even if lower intensity . in my judgement there are two related design flaws with this lamp : 1 . the narrow focused beam , making you `` live ( ? ? ) with '' the single direction in which you aim the beam . its relatively dim peripheral light gets lost in any ambient light . 2 . that is in turn aggravated by its wandering from the aiming you settle on , both vertically and horizontally . the vertical part is the worse ; the mounting clamp sets too far back from the headlight 's balance-point , so it 's a seesaw that 's forward-heavy . lift your bike front , tap it down lightly , and you 've likely refocused the lamp lower , as you would not if the mounting were at the balance-point . aim it temporarily right ( and tight ) , and you are seemingly good to go ... but only as far as the first noticeable bump . it then drops a few degrees , and you keep correcting it vertically , to light either your intended path , or the oncoming drivers ' windshields . your need is like being at the oscars : you want to both see , and be seen , only in this case to save your life . i am chasing after another led lamp now , which i understand to have a wider ( along with brighter ) beam . i have respect for cateye in general . their current website page of battery-op headlamps does not offer the el-300 .
1	as an intermediate player , i have been highly satisfied with this racquet
0	small print on box : charging the spotlight takes approximately 15 hours using the ac charger adapter , and approximately 12-20 hours using the 12v car adapter . the spotlight/lantern can not be used while charging . a full charge will provide for approximately 30 minutes of power . 30 minutes after charging for 15 hours ? what the heck is the point of this flashlight
0	i have an original thighmaster i purchased years ago ... thinking this thighmaster gold was going to be similar i purchased it to take to work with me . it is very flimsy-it seems to be made of very light weight material that is not going to hold up . my old thighmaster is very sturdy-i have been using it for years and it looks fairly new . this one will be ready for the trash can in less than a year . save your money

0	i bought the cycleops wind indoor trainer to train at home when i ca n't hit the road because of work ( or weather ) complications . if you are like me that means weekdays late at night , or very early in the morning . i 'm terribly frustrated because i ca n't use it due to the unbearable noise the fan flywheel makes . my neighbors ca n't stand it . hey , i ca n't stand it ! the noise level is comparable to an industrial vacuum cleaner . to give you an idea , i do n't even hear the music from my ipod while riding this thing . do n't buy it ! go for the magnetic resistance models .
1	with a job that is extremely sedentary , 3 days sitting all day at a desk , 2 days putting on 220 miles or more sitting in a car , this has been a most welcome purchase . 5 to 10 minutes on this each day , has greatly relieved my low back discomfort to the point where i 'm able to continue this heavy work schedule , in relative comfort . if compressed discs are your problem , you 've got to try this , after first checking with your physician

0	i bought the armor abs because my gym membership just ended at my college . so i wanted to get a few small workout machines for home . the day i got it , one of the rubber bands popped of its holder already . the machine is designed very poorly , although what can you expect for the price . i 've had to reattach the bands at least 15 times over the past week , and today one of the rubber band holders snapped in half , leaveing that resistance level useless : - ( . overall though , i have to say , i really love this thing . if it wasnt for the d*mn bands flyin off all the time , it would be a great peice of equipment . if you use it carefully and correctly , you may be able to avoid these problems though . i give it a two because i love the machine , but i hate its bad habits ...
1	i was looking at the bigger cargo boxes but everything seems so big and heavy . i need a cargo box that i can put up alone on top the acura mdx-just the right size . the box was easy to assemble - less than an hour . it is also easy to attach to the vehicle . the box looks like the more expensive boxes on top of my vehicle and color matches well with my silver mdx . i just wish the plastic was a little thicker but i think it will hold up well . the box is sturdy after assembling i
0	i 've been looking for weight lifting gloves , and trying out gloves that seemed to work for me but either bled onto my hands or ripped . these gloves , however , dried out my hands and made me use lots of moisturizers . they also tore down the knuckles on my left hand and in between the thumbs . weighlifting gloves are yes supposed to keep your hands dry during work outs and to prevent calases . these gloves dried out my hands completely and gave me calases . if you want a good pair of gloves do not get these
0	i thought this was great at first until i realized that it works sporadically . i can get up in the morning and walk all over the house , look down and check my sportline to find it is still registered at 0 steps . other times i can walk a mile or more and find it recorded maybe 20 steps . one of the problems with it is its shape . unlike some pedometers ( like omron ) that are a vertical oval-shape , the sportline is a horizontal rectangle , which makes it easily roll with the waistline of your pants or skirt . it 's important for a pedometer to be perpendicular to the ground for it to record accurately . after much frustration , i finally bought an omron pedometer which i love . unfortunately , this sportline model is so inconsistent and inaccurate as to be useless .
0	let me first say that i did not purchase this mini stepper through amazon , but rather directly from the discovery channel store . two weeks after i submitted my review of their product on their web site , however , they still have not seen fit to post it . i used the discovery electronic mini stepper daily for 29 days ( 30 minutes per day ) before the cable around the pulley-wheel broke . this seems to be a consistent problem with this piece of equipment , judging by previous reviews on the dcs ( discover channel store ) web site . being inside the 30 day return window , i sent my stepper back for a refund . customer service , i must say , was excellent ... only the product itself was cheap and substandard . on a related note , this is the third mini stepper ( various brands , not all dcs ) i have owned in the past year . they have all broken down in one way or another . feel free to look at some of my previous reviews here to get the details , but the bottom line is that this will be my last mini stepper . take some advice from me when i say that these machines are built for people who are beginners in the world of fitness . that is to say , if you intend to use a mini stepper two or three days per week for 15-20 minutes , then you may be satisfied with one . however , if you are at an advanced or even intermediate stage in your workout routine , then do n't even consider one of these machines - you will destroy it , trust me . there 's just too much that can go wrong -- pulleys cracking , pulley cables breaking , shocks leaking ... and i actually broke the frame of one stepper . through all of this , i have learned one important lesson about exercise : keep it simple . i am now having great success with some simple resistance bands ( many varieties are available here at amazon ) and cardiovascular exercises ( e.g . regular old jumping-jacks ) . i get a better workout than any i ever got from a mini stepper , and i 'm feeling great and even lost a little weight in the right places : - ) honestly , if you want to save yourself some grief , please learn from my experiences and avoid the horrible cycle of mini stepper destruction . just buy yourself some resistance bands , maybe a jump rope , an exercise mat , an instructional video/book , and then get to work . exercising to tone your body and lose weight is n't easy ( and if it is , then you 're probably not doing it right ) , but you can make it easier by not wasting your time and money on junk like this
1	i have owned this bag for a few years and have found it to be an excellent bag for the gym . my size ten running shoes fit fine and it is easy to store behind my seat in my car . i am not sure if someone with a large shoe size ... say 13 and above may have some trouble or high top shoes ( basketball shoes ) may find the bag a tight squeeze . overall very satisfied
1	very well made product ; easy assembly and mounting . the no wobble feature is excellent . highly recommend this product
0	i bought this for my four year old for christmas . the net was broken on the second use when my four year old lightly banged it on our car bumper . a week later , his friend , also four , broke one of the sticks when taking a shot with the feather-weight plastic puck that comes with the set . do n't waste your money . even for little kids it 's probably worth it to just go ahead and buy real equipment that will last .
0	this is the biggest joke on the planet . no doubt , it is scary , but c'mon people . i guess it 's to scare the sh*t out of you . my comment has to be the first serious review that has been made for this item . think about it . . . the toilet . one of the best places for germs . and you want to attach some rubber device to it . i 'll do you one better , and you 'll get just as good a laugh from it . ( also , it 'll be a lot cheaper ) go buy a roll of saran-wrap . cling it tightly to the top of the toilet bowl . wait and watch as your guest visit the bathroom to use it . i do n't think no one will die from this type of trick

0	i wanted a bike to ride around on unpaved trails on my few acres in the country . this retro designed , one speed , steel framed , coaster braked , comfort bike seemed to be the ideal choice . when it arrived , i pulled out the tool box and set to work assembling it . the first frustration was that the instructions for assembling this bike are not included in the manual ( which seems to cover every bike but this one ) . how hard could it be to write up instructions ( with tool specifications ) for each model they manufacture ? a one page flyer could have done the trick . to further complicate matters , some of the models in the manual are assembled using metric tools and others call for standard sizes . it turned out that i could n't complete the assembly , because i could n't find a tool to handle the quick release hardware for the seat attachment . i had to take the bike to a bike shop to complete the assembly . even the bike shop had problems with this bike , because there is so little clearance between the fenders and the tires . i watched while they had to bend the sides of the back fender out by hand , so that it would n't rub the tire . when i got the bike home , the first thing that i did was to adjust the seat to the correct height , and take it out for a ride . within 10 seconds the seat slipped all the way down . the quick release handle ca n't hold the seat in place with the weight of a rider on it ( i 'm not that heavy ) . chrysler should have taken the retro design a step farther on this , and drilled holes in the seat stem for a rod insert to adjust the seat height . rather than try to dis- assemble this and box it up to return it ... i will check to see if i can drill the seat stem myself to get the seat secured at a ridable height . its too bad they could n't come up with a workable design for such an essential part of the bike as the seat height adjustment ! the points i do give here are for the otherwise sturdy frame , and tires that will work well for unpaved trails ... when i can finally ride this .
0	do n't waste your money unless your workout is sitting on the couch . this monitor is sold as `` providing unobtrusive reading of your heart rate during your workout '' . since you have to stand still to get an accurate reading one has to wonder what type of workout reebok did to substantiate this claim . get a strapped monitor for working out . while this is a great idea the design does n't match the intended purpose

1	this was a gamble since it is n't cheap and the results promised are no different from any other supplement ad campaign . i only tried muscle milk because i read up on it after seeing it endorsed by an nfl athelete during an espn interview . i started using it about 2 months ago and have been consistant with the servings daily . two months later my strength has increased , my mass has increased and my body fat has noticeably diminished . my workout routine and diet was always the same before starting on mm but the results since using mm have made an impact , there is nothing else i can attribute it to . the fact that it also tastes great is a nice bonus but given the definite results of mm i would still use it if it tastes like battery acid . do not fool yourself , it is loaded with fat . it relies on you to workout steadily and maintian a clean diet for you to realize it 's true benefit . you will not get sculpted by using mm without commitment , you will only get fatter . but if you are committed and use mm as suggested it will most certainly produce a change in your appearance .
0	i was promised 1-2 day shipping and did n't get it . i was promised reciept by dec. 6th and have n't gotten it

1	i 've had this bike for about a month now and it runs smoothly , went together fairly easy , and best of all its quiet ! something i seriously appreciate in exercise equipment is when i can actually hear the television over the machine . the complaints about the box falling apart during shipping is legitimate . the bike i received had a cracked cover because of the dent in the box ( arrived when i was at work or i 'd have sent it back ) . when i called for service i was greeted promptly , promised a replacement cover , and told that although they were instructed to tell me ten days they 'd bet more like 3-5 . they even suggested that i consider where i was in the setup before i assembled the bike and whether or not i 'd want to take it apart to put the new part in . very positive experience ... now if i could just get myself to spend more time on it

0	this stand is very bad quality . not worth investing in this stand . the speed bag platform isnt even made out of real wood . it vibrates too much ! the swivel it comes with is made out of plastic ! it sucks ! invest in a better stand like the ones from www.balazsboxing.co
0	well , i got through about a clip and a half before it started breaking . first it went from semi-auto to uncontrolled auto , then it just stopped working . it was pretty cool for a bit , and is pretty light and easy to set up , but i 'd suggest looking somewhere else for a pistol
1	i bought one of these , based from a review . i pretty much agree with her , the machine is great and it gives a good workout . but she forgot to mention , the thing can cause your feet to get sore ! i tried wearing high quality running shoes and it still hurt . i received an advice to attatch foam strips to the runners that you stand on , and that has solved the problem ! so far , i have not used the pistons , so it 's just a cardio workout . i have tony 's tapes he sells on his website and his music cd 's , and i do get a very good workout ! i have lost 13 pounds so far by using it , and i noticed it defanitely toned up the buns
1	this is the best , jansport has always made an outstanding product . this is the third one i have owned . plenty of room and just right size
0	this is my third heart rate monitor . i purchased this one because the battery died in my last hr watch . i thought i could replace the battery , but when i tried to replace it , i broke it . oh well . . . anyway , i purchased the reebok fitness hr watch because it was on sale ( 50 % off retail ) . i could n't find any reviews on it so i `` rolled the dice . '' with my two previous hr watches , it was pretty intuitive as to how to set and operate them without reading the instructions . with the reebok hr watch , i had to read the instructions a couple of times . after a couple of training sessions , i began to feel comfortable on how to operate it and use its settings . there are a few pros on the reebok hr watch : ( 1 ) the chest heart rate strap will work with precor cardio machines with heart rate monitors . ( 2 ) the chest heart rate strap 's battery is easily replaced . ( i do n't know about the watch . ) ( 3 ) it has a lot of features that you 'll find in higher priced hr watches . now , the cons : ( 1 ) the heart rate reading is much too small if you 're near-sighted or need reading glasses . ( 2 ) the shape of the crystal cover causes a glare under certain indoor and outdoor lighting so it 's difficult to read the small heart rate reading . in conclusion , because the heart rate reading is too small and there 's a glare , i ca n't read the watch unless i slow down , steady my arm , and position my arm at a certain angle to deflect the glare . because of this , i 'm disappointed with this watch . if you 've got good eyesight , you can add 1-star
0	this gun is horrible . i bought this for my friend and let me tell you it was a waste of $ $ $ . first off it is a 3/4 scale gun so it is very small and very light , if you were to drop it it would deffinitly shatter . also the cocking system is terrible on the top there is a lever you have to pull and if pulled in the wrong spot it will snap off and then it would be useless . when we did end up shooting it the bbs wentd straight for about 5 or 10 ft then curve down , so unless you are going get within five ft of a person it is useless , even if you do get that close he wont even jump the fps is more like 270 not 370 . also the clip is an absolute pain to load first you pour all the bbs into a chamber , then you pull down a spring and shake it upsidedown fot the bbs to gome onto the front chambet then you have to release the spring and put the clip in the gun . after about 10-15 shots you have to take the clip out and repeat the process . granted it holds 180 or so bbs you can only shoot about 15 at a time . over all this gun stinks . i bought it when it was originaly 100.00 but the list price was 10.00 so i thought it was going to be decent , but i was wrong . spend your money elsewhere ! ! ! ! !

0	**********update - the old review ( see below ) was for dixiekip . the only reason it 's still two stars is because i ca n't figure out how to change it . old vegas chips has been nothing but helpful in this matter even though i did n't actually order the cards from them . i would order from them any day of the week now just based on their customer service in an issue that was n't even theirs . my apologies to old vegas chips in this matter . i highly recommend them and if anyone knows how to change the stars , please let me know . if you are interested in these cards , go with old vegas chips , not some other dealer ! ! ! ! - jim ****************** i ordered these particular plastic cards because in my opinion , they are much cooler than the paisley ones that are also offered . i immediately ordered them , yet when my package arrived yesterday ( in a timely manner , i will give them that ) i opened to find the ugly paisley cards looking me in the face . i have not yet contacted the seller to see what options i have , but this is going to leave me either two options , 1 ) return them and wait longer for them or 2 ) suck it up and get stuck with the ugly cards . i will repost once i have spoken to them
1	first off , those of you calling it a `` clip '' should know that a clip is a nonremovable ammunition storage device attatched to or built into the gun itself . please call it a magazine ( actual name for it ) and a full metal jacket isnt a full magazine of amunition its a bullet with a full metal casing like say 30-06 round . second , dont complain about the scope because it is a decorative instrument . you can buy better scopes if your hardcore but if you are hardcore then get a real gun . this gun is good for shooting your little cousin from far away . its a great gun dont get me wrong but its not meant to be used and abused like a ww2 garand or bar . it 's plastic , it shoots things . i 'm probably reinstating most of what everyone else said but thats just one more reassurance . so yeah get this gun if airsoft is a hobby for you . not a sport . i also suggest getting .20g bbs and maybe a speedloader or 2 cause mags are so expensive and this gun pours ammo like water . have fun . p.s . though they may noth have the trigger finger ability , spring airsoft guns have a tendency to be more accurate and fire harder with heavier bb 's . if you are playin with friends i suggest getting a $ 30 dollar rifle with 250-300 fps ( shoots like 300-350
0	my first pedometer from sportline worked only a few days ( digital display completely disappeared ) , so i returned it to them , and after over two months and several emails from me to them , they replaced it with this sportline 350 . the first two days , it worked fine , although it seemed to count many more steps than it should have . the third day , in the middle of the day it said approx . 3400 steps , later that afternoon it said 1300 steps , and by nighttime the display totally disappeared , and never came back . i just sent the second one back , and am expecting that again it will take several weeks and multiple emails to get the situation resolved with their slow customer service . their products seem to be very poorly made , and i do n't expect to purchase any more ... . after reading the reviews , i have just purchased an omron , and am hoping it will be much more reliable
1	one thing i really like is that there was no plastic or rubber taste on the first use . it holds enough for long bike ride and was cold all the way to the end of the ride . it feels good on your back too . it helps in this florida heat . cons : the mouth piece is hard to hold onto because of the 180 degree angle . it would be easier to have a t mouth piece . i will be looking for a replacement .
1	we have used more expensive `` professional '' grade ergometers that would have cost at least three times as much and we are very pleased with how the integrity compares for a home version . assembly and operation are easy , the equipment seems well built and the noisy breeze generated by the wind resistance wheel is very tolerable , allowing conversation or tv viewing with only moderate volume increases
0	initially , the 340 was way too sensitive to be even remotely accurate . it did , however , give my wife a good laugh ; she was sure that at least 5000 of my 10000 'steps ' were registered while sitting perfectly still and clicking the tv remote . but after one week of use , the darn thing became so *in*sensitive that it would only register when i jumped up and down like a pogo stick . pass on this one
1	this has been a great addition to my truck - a useful compass and outside thermometer without going to the expense of a navigation system ( and without having to learn another techno-gadget ) . my only complaint is that the display illumination could be a bit brighter . i realize that a bright light on the dashboard could impair one 's night vision , but a bit more contrast on the display would be helpful at night .
0	it holds my bike but seems unstable - i still ca n't figure out where all 6 straps go on my car , and the support rails tilt downward towards the rear instead of upwards . plus , probably the biggest concern - there is no means of strapping the bike to the rack ( user must tie the bike down every time ) . my bike has n't fallen off though..
0	my daughter is 38 '' and about 30lbs . it 's the perfect size for her . we mainly use it as something to lay on while watching tv or reading books on the floor . pros - when in the `` chair position '' , it 's tall enough to accommodate taller children . - cover is removeable and washable - comes with handy pink storage bag ( although it 's kinda hard to fit the pump in the bag along with the bed ) - pretty easy to convert into chair ( there are 2 straps on each side of the bed that need to be `` connected '' in order to change it into chair - they are color coded ) . might be hard for young children to figure out how to do it . - inside of sleep bag is made of soft material ( although it appears as though it may snag easily ) . - large zipper located on one side of the sleep bag . easy for small hands to use . - weight limit : 100 lbs cons - the pump is very cheaply made and it takes a long time to inflate the bed ( it operates by use of foot motion or you can use your hands ) . - the air slowly leaks out of the bed . we actually thought ours had a hole in it when purchased , so we exchanged for another one . but this one too deflates pretty quickly . example : if we completely inflate at 7pm , by 8am the next morning it needs to be inflated again because it loses about 40 % of it 's air . - adult help is needed to change into chair . - adult help is needed to inflate . overall : it 's a bit pricey for the quality i was expecting . it would be nice if adult assistance was n't needed to change from bed to chair and back . defitely would work as an extra sleeping spot for the night , but it takes along time to inflate and requires an adult to do so
1	i purchased this bench about a year ago . i received it in 4 business days which i thought was really good . it took me about 45 minutes to put it together , there is alot of nuts and bolts , but once i finished assembly it has been a good machine , and i am still using it to do my weight lifting routines twice a week , it offers alot of different exercises , what i really love about it is the lat tower which alot of benches do not have until you get into the $ 300- $ 400.00 dollar range , which i was not willing to spend that much at the time . for the price of 129 bucks and the options you get , just can beat it . i am very happy with this machine . this machine is made by impex fitness and i definitely plan on upgrading to another impex when im ready . chris- v
0	ninety dollars for this is unbelievable . for less than $ 15 ( that is less than one sixth the advertised price ) someone with no skill could make an equivalent product from pine 4x4s and 1x12s in 30 minutes or less . it may not be `` cool '' , but it 'll get the job done . are you more interested in getting fit or having cool , trendy , and frivolous toys ? avoid this plastic albatross . it will be destined for a garage sale near you within two years . go to your local hardware store , spend half an hour and $ 20 ( and maybe learn how to work with your hands a bit ) and get what you need without supporting this craziness ... or -- just go for a walk for free . save your hard-earned money

0	i bought this toy for my 9 month old son for christmas . he loved it and it is a wonderful toy . however , in mid january it started to sound as if the batteries were dying and then it just quit . i replaced the batteries but to my disappointment it still would n't work . i tried different batteries again just to be sure and still nothing . i had a very hard time finding out how to contact imaginarium.com and finally just emailed amazon . they responded quickly and it appears that i will be able to return the toy and my son liked it enough that i may take my chances and buy it again . there are mixed reviews some saying that it is durable and works great and a few like mine
1	we bought this for my son when he was about 2 months old . he would just lay in it and would be entertained for a long time , which bought me time to do housework around him , etc . you can take the hanging pieces down and hang up other objects so that there 's always variety . i 'd say he lost interest in it though at about 7 months when he learned to crawl . i bought mine used on ebay and it was worth the $ 35 i spent . i would n't spend much more than that .
1	this is a nice sword for $ 35 ( plus tax ) . when i removed the sheath , there was some sort of goo on the blade ( probaby so it would n't rust ) . this is a carbon blade , so do n't leave it in a moist closet for 1 or 5,376 years ( by then the rusted blade alone will be worth a fortune ) . just dont get the blade wet , ok. you can rub a moist towel across it to get rid of the rust protector if you 're going to use it often but that is pretty much all you can do to clean it without a special kit . please dont brandish this sword around like a bad actor in a kung-fu movie . you could realy hurt someone with the point of the blade . i think this is shipped over seas , so dont challenge your friend to a violent battle the day after you buy this and you should be fine . blue dragon is actualy a japanese video game that no one bought . i think it was based on a part of final fantasy 2 . i do n't want to bore you with video games , so i 'll get to the point . put it on display , dont cut your lawn with it , dont play ninja with it , and dont ever ever ever ever ever ever try to cut a solid object in half with it ( prefrebly a tin can ) because the cheap blade could fly off the tang and hurt you ( or prefrebly your neibor ) in the face . please do n't throw the blade at your neibor either . p.s . i am not neil meislin , i am his son , daniel meislin . if you ca n't understand my numerous perenthesis , i guess you 're not smarter than a 5th grader .
0	the plug that keeps the air in kept popping out . we took it back and bought another one . same problem . so we took it back again . i think we spent more on gas going back and forth than we did on the float . buy one of better quality
0	i purchased the ab lounge 2 online , but returned it the same day . it 's too bulky heavy . i wanted it for my bedroom to use in the mornings while watching the news , but it 's too heavy to move around , and it does not fold . i put it together in my living room , and then tried to get it into my bedroom but it would n't fit through the door . i had to un-screw the bars , fold pull it through the door . if i had put the ab lounge 2 downstairs , then i would never use it . unless you want the `` ab lounge 2 '' to be a `` permanent '' fixture in your bedroom or living room , then i would order something else . i need this thing to be where i can easily use it then put it away ... ... .the ab lounge 2 is way too big bulky for that . unless you have a room where it will remain a permanent fixture , then do n't buy it . i 'm buying the `` ultra '' ab lounge because it folds for easy storage ... .it 's more expensive , but to me it 's worth the convenience of having the `` easy '' storage capability . i do n't my exercise equipment to be sitting in my bedroom or living room when it 's not in use .
0	unfortunately , i purchased this product . thermometer and compass are not at all working . thermometer always shows 65 f and compass allways shows err . i highly recommend not to buy this on
1	i ordered these for my husband for christmas and he loves them , he says that they are better than any that they have at his gym . very durable and only moderately padded , great for the price
0	this was given to me as a gift . i used it almost every day for about 1 1/2 months then a cable on it broke.it never even worked that well to begin with . i e-mailed the company for a new cable since it was covered under the warranty . they told me they had to order it from china and had no idea when it would come . they gave no apologies , they could not have cared less . eight months later after i had already gotten rid of the piece of junk they sent it to me ! ! ! ! ! i used it for 1 month the whole year ! ! how lame
1	a great multifunctional stove with lots of room . extremely functional with three burners and the side flaps helped keep the wind , dust , and other campground debris out of your food . propane is the only way to go when you 're cooking in the wild woods were doing some backwoods camping . while the stove has lots of room for cooking it folds down nicely making it a great compact pack along . a must-have for any camping trip
1	i bought this bike for my son for christmas and he loves it ! no problems with it so far , it is built well and the price was awesome .
1	this mat is great . my advice for all you yogis that ca n't keep your hands from reenacting starsky and hutch during downdog is to be a little patient or just creative . you have two options other than getting upset and throwing your new ( expensive ) mat in the back corner of your closet . first , i recommend that you buy an organic degreaser . give your mat a couple of sprays ( not too much ) , give it a scrub with a brush , hose it off , and hang it out to dry . this should help . option two is to put your mat in the washer on delicate cycle with cold water and baking soda . do n't use soap unless you really want to be embarrassed the next time you start sweating in your sun salutes . i put my mat in the washer and have n't had any problems , but i 'm not sure if manduka would actually endorse that . with that , and a little bit of wear and tear , you should end up with a solid mat .
0	i purchased this bike from a local dealer 15 months ago and it has broken down 3 times in the last 15 months . the resistence motor is defective which is what i have had replaced 3 times now . this motor does not allow you to change gears or bike through a program -- upgrading to shifiting on the fly technology would be a plus . the positive aspect of the bike is the comfort and grip heart rate monitor and the ability to swap out saddles also a plus . ovewrall i can not recommend this product .
1	we have a slightly sloped yard so i was hesitant about getting a trampoline . we tried it , and it works fine ! my kids love it ! of course , like any other toy , they take it in spells but it still gets used alot after 6 months . i was also concerned at first about them falling off of it . i almost bought the enclosure to go with it but i decided to wait and see how high they jumped , etc . this trampoline is so small , they really ca n't get a lot of `` air '' so they do n't do flips and other dangerous tricks . it 's also very low to the ground . i am glad now that i did n't get the enclosure . we do n't really need it . i would recommend this trampoline for younger kids . the weight limit is 120 lbs so it ca n't support larger kids . also , since it is so small , we only let our two preschoolers jump together . when we have guests over , it 's one at a time . i love it that my kids want to be outside so much . this is better money spent than on video games , in my opinion
1	my second pair . knew exactly what i wanted . small woman with small hands and small fit perfectly . great deal
1	i 've worked out with cathe for about 6 months now , and i have to say , this is one of my favorite workouts . it combines cardio with upper and lower body in a 60 minute circuit workout . the cardio bursts are short but intense- expect to jump , do power 15 's , fast feet shuffles , spike lunges , etc . lower body work - well , let 's just say , i hope you like to do leg press- since you 'll be doing it - a lot . there are a total of 6 sets of leg press - on each leg . also , cathe inserts some static lunges and squats , among other moves . she does hover squats with pulses of 16 over the high step- your quads will be feeling the burn , there ! arm work includes typical weighted and non-weight work , such as tricep dips off the high step , push ups , bicep curls , overhead extension , etc . overall , if you 're looking for a challenge and a new circuit workout to shock your muscles , this is the workout for you . beginners , beware- you can modify certain exercises ( i use dumbbells instead of a barbell ) - but this is more for the intermediate or advanced exerciser
1	i bought this bike after not riding since i was 14 ( 32 now ) . the box arrived in excellent condition and the bike was nearly completely assembled . i also had a little trouble with adjusting the front brake but got it figured out . overall this is a great bike for those casual trips around town . i 'm not a trail seeker , so have never tried it off road . very happy with the quality and ease of assembly
1	i recently got into gymnastics so i started looking for a leotard for someone with real curves . i 'm 5'6 '' and 180lbs and the xl fits me great . it has long sleeves which is great for the wintertime and i do n't have to feel self consciousness about my fat hanging out there because it covers it up . it 's cut low enough so that i 'm not getting wedgies and i can do handstands without worrying if my workout shirt got un-tucked . it 's not flashy so i do n't look like a 10 year old in a fat 26 year olds body . it 's nice and plain , gets the job done and i 'm sure the others at they gym thank me for covering up for goodness sakes
1	excellent product do n't hesitate this big umbrella is the perfect one to protect you and your equipment when rains start
0	the brunton nexus star is a low-cost , fairly rugged , basic compass . like any low-cost compass , if you know how to use it you can get where you want to go , but it lacks features you may later wish you had . on the plus side , it is lightweight , inexpensive , and fairly thin , so it does n't take up a lot of room in your pocket . on the minus side , the baseplate is very short , so it is harder to use with a map and a little less accurate when reading a bearing . the biggest disadvantage , in my opinion , is that it does n't have a true declination adjustment ; it is advertised as having a `` declination scale '' which is not the same . on a baseplate compass , you take a bearing by lining up the compass needle inside the north reference indicator ( sometimes called the `` doghouse '' ) etched on the bottom of the vial . compasses with true declination adjustment allow you to rotate this `` doghouse '' to align it with the desired declination . that way you always read a bearing by aligning the needle inside the doghouse . on the nexus star , however , you ca n't do this . instead , you have to remember to line up the compass needle with the point on the scale that corresponds to the local declination . in this case , the needle is not boxed inside the doghouse , and i find it can lead to errors , especially when you are tired and not thinking clearly after a long hike . if you always navigate using magnetic bearings rather than true bearings , this is n't a problem . i can recommend this compass for use with a gps receiver that is set to read magnetic bearings , and it is suitable as a back-up compass . i also regularly use it as an inexpensive tool to teach students in my gps classes how to use a compass , but i would n't recommend it for serious work
1	this - along with a pogo stick and stilts - was my effort to get my kids offf the video games at least some of the time ! i thought this might be too hard for the 6 year old , but he persisted and is getting better at it . the point is , it 's so fun he keeps trying ! the 13 yr old - and my 17 year old daughter are enjoying it too . there seems to be a trade-off between the stilts and the hit-a-way . only the little guy can handle the pogo stick - go figure
0	i went to a sports store and all they carried were sportline pedometers . i really did n't know which one to buy so i bought this one because it was more attractive than the bright yellow one and it was more expensive than the 340 so i thought it was better somehow . even though it says that it measures steps accurately on the packaging , it does n't actually display it . it only uses it to calculate the distance that you 've walked . i was very annoyed by this because the 340 does track and display the number of steps walked . i got over it but the thing keeps resetting in my pocket . i 'm just going to buy another pedometer . one that displays the steps walked and has a cover
1	just like the ones used in college intra-murals , excellent stitching and look to be very durable . fast shipping , and great deal
1	i thought the dvd was excellent from the standpoint of a person not having much experience in lifting or exercising . it shows great technique and form . i used to be a wrestler in the highly competitive state of iowa so over the years i learned many of these pushup and workout techniques . pushups and dumbbells used to be my main source of lifting and staying in shape . i found myself to be too advanced for the power 10 workout so the video seemed like common knowledge . so for beginners and more advanced people looking for a great dvd focusing on developing proper form and technique this is an excellent dvd . the dvd takes you through many different styles of pushups showing the proper form and setup . it then does about a set of three of that style pushup to show you the routine in live workout motion . with the dvd purchase i was hoping to find an exercise program , approximately 30-45 minutes long , that sets up a nice workout routine for people short on time . i was hoping for a video that combines a variety of different pushups using the perfect pushup into a nice timed workout . a workout that works my chest , back , arms , abs , and some cardio into a nice overall workout that is done in short time . something similar to a tae bo style video or other timed exercise videos . the power 10 workout is n't that type of video . it is more specifically a technique video that one can evntually combined into a workout of their own . i recently wrote some emails to the body rev president suggesting the development of a video for more advanced people that provides a fast , effective workout routine that one could get at the gym , but can do at home in 30-45 minutes with their perfect pushup . he seemed pretty impressed by the idea so hopefully bodyrev builds on this dvd like they have for their other products .
1	i mainly get stuff like this because i like the looks , not that i actually use the merchandise that much . the knife seems sturdy and strong . the nylon sheath is high quality .
0	i bought a gustbuster umbrella several months ago , expecting that it 'd be the last umbrella i ever needed . wow , was that a bad decision . this `` windproof '' umbrella had two of the spokes break in a light wind ( the weather report said the winds that day were only about 15 miles per hour ) . so i e-mailed the company because i remembered that it had a `` lifetime guarantee . '' they told me that i 'd have to ship it back to them ( which is perfectly fine ) , but i 'd also have to pay them $ 10 for their trouble . what kind of lifetime guarantee is that ? for $ 10 or less i could buy another umbrella locally . their product has proven that it 's not superior and it does n't live up to the claims they make for it . do n't spend all this extra money on a gustbuster because you think it 'll work better . it wo n't . go out and buy a normal umbrella for 1/3 or 1/4 the price of a gustbuster -- you 'll probably get the same amount of use out of the normal umbrella , and you wo n't be paying an outrageous price for something that does n't work the way their marketing claims
0	i had a lot of fun with this stove while it lasted but it did not last long -- about six months ! i live on a sailboat and i used it every day ; maybe someone who goes camping once a year will have a better experience . the burner did not simmer well ( the flame kept creeping back up ) but the grill worked great until the stove itself died . it seems to have a design flaw -- the regulator has an unusually narrow diameter tube and the propane tubes inside the stove are flimsy and wobbly . i called century and they said this is the way the stove is supposed to be . hmmmm . i did not think it would last long but i liked it so much that when it died i tried out another one . this one was immediately defective and i took it back . neither century nor coleman seems to make a tough propane stove any more . camp chef may be a better , though much more expensive , choice for a person who does a lot of camping
0	i ordered and received this item through the golf warehouse . it arrived and i immediately saw a defect , in that the magnetic balls would not release correectly , even with major force . i contacted the golf wrehouse and they told me to return the item to them . i requested a refund but they refused this saying the item showed signs of use and returned it to me . since then i have tried to contact david leadbetter 's organization but without any success . i am desperately unhappy about this purchase and , in particular , the after sales service . derek price toronto , o
1	i got this bike and i instantly liked it . the only problem was the seat could not fit properly to the base . i tried many times to tighten it up but does n't help . well , other than that its a wonderful bike , zip noise and would burn a lot of calories ... ... ...
0	this tiny item ships for $ 2 more than it costs . i 'll purchase it elsewhere
1	loved this mat ! great for taller yogis . great tickness too ... a bit slippery but after a couple of sessions it wears off i totally recommend it !
0	expedited shipping was erroneously entered for this order . tried to change and then cancel it minutes after entry and repeatedly until it came to no avail . refused package a month ago . exorbitant charge made to my credit card and i will have to seek resolution with them , since amazon takes no responsibility . vendor has not responded to over 20 calls and emails to cancel/refund order . amazon places orders with sketchy vendors like this and then you 're stuck with erroneous charges . beware ! !

0	i have been using a polar s610 for some time . when everything is working it is a wonderful device . however , it is difficult to keep it running smoothly . for example , when i upgrade to a new computer i go through hell getting the software to work again . polar customer service is useless . most recently i have been unable to upload data from the monitor to my pc via usb for months . i do not believe i will be able cure the problem without purchasing new software + the software dose not include the usb connection software . that is sold seperately . polar will not provide replacement software unless you purchase it on cd . the rest of the world will provide software and upgrades to registered users online . bottom line - the product is pretty good . however in terms of user friendly polar is a total failure . sorry folks - why not get a garmin 305 - i a
1	i looked at several inversion tables before deciding on my life gear and have no regrets in buying it . i am 6'2 '' and weigh 220 lbs . and it performs beautifully for me . it is well built and the memory foam makes it comfortable to lay on . it was easy to assemble and took only a short time before i was using it . i have found that just a few minutes will relax me and has helped my arthritis too . i no longer have pain in my neck or between my shoulders . i would strongly urge people who have had back surgery to consult with their doctor before using any inversion table because they do stretch your back
1	this gun is awsome it is the best gun you will ever get for such a good price and guns that are 10 20 or even 30 dollars more the gun is very very light and looks great you can take of the front and the arm rest to make it look like as machine gun or something scope is great and is a super accurate gun i have shot a can down from farther than 40 feet ( one shot ) the laser is not super good and hard to use but it comes seperate so you can put it on or take it of whenever a bb might ratle around in their once in a while but it will fall out over all greatest gun ever ! !
0	i received my stamina products adjustable hyperextension bench on march 13th of '07 and was very disappointed . there was hardly any insulation whatsoever in the box and it looked like it was just thrown in the box . the product was scratched and parts were broken . fortunately the bench works , but it looks like it is already a few years old with all the damage . the product seems to be of quality , it 's just unfortunate that sps does n't understand how important that packaging is and if it is insufficient it makes the product look cheap
0	the handle bars keep loosening up which in turn makes it very dangerous . also , the base metal footboard is cracking . i would n't spend the money on this scooter . it 's not worth it . spend your money on a cheaper model razor .
1	it 's more expensive than some , but it 's well-made , works perfectly , and will last for years . not requiring removal of the top to pour is great . just buy it already
1	the two most respected bodybuilding supplements are ( 1 ) whey protein and ( 2 ) creatine . they are also considered natural products or food products . while whey is without a doubt extremely useful , creatine does not help everybody . i have used creatine monohydrate in the past and i found it to be useless . it was so utterly ineffective that i just felt robbed of my hard earned money . my tub still sits in the cupboard . i have never used any other supplement products other than the ones that seem to be on the safe side as these both are . i heard about no-xplode from some bodybuilders who seemed to think it was probably one of the best supplement products to come out in years . i researched it and it appears that bsn has formulated a surging `` creatine + nitric oxide '' drink that seems to work with most people . not everybody sees results but this stuff worked for me and that is what counts . although no-xplode contains some serious chemistry ( see below ) and possibly some debatable compounds ( guanidino propionic acid [ gpa ] and glycocamine ) it is probably well worth the very low-level risks for the results . 40 minutes after taking this stuff i can either cardio high intensity for 30 min flat ( maybe even more ) and complete a full range of compound weight lifts in the gym without feeling any interruption in my power . no fatigue . the surge is exactly as it promises . you will feel that you have nitro pumping around your body . it sets in at about 20 minutes for me . i feel a little woozy at first , disorientated , then my brain picks up and my body feels energetic . put it into action and you will see results . it also boats a cem3 type of creatine that prevents you from bloating up like monohydrate does . i never have stepped much outside of what is considered safe but in my opinion no-xplode is standing on the fence saying i am about the best bang for your buck without any serious side effects . so far this stuff is getting very good feedback . yes it contains lots of mind boggling ingredients , but if you are looking for the creatine edge , even if creatine has never worked for you before , then no-xplode is probably the one . it can also help build muscle , but even if it does n't for you , it is still worth it for the surge . i am very glad that i got it . very . serving size : 1 scoop ( 20.5g ) servings per container : 40 amount per serving : calories : 36 -calories from fat : 0 total fat : 0g -saturated fat : 0g cholesterol : 0mg sodium : 150mg potassium : 75mg total carbohydrates : 9g -sugars : 0g protein : 0g vitamin b6 : 25mg - ( pyridoxine hcl ) vitamin b12 : 120mcg - ( cyanocobalamine ) folic acid : 400mcg magnesium : 360mg phosphorus : 500mg calcium : 75mg no-xplode proprietary blend : 20,500mg ( no-xplode contains a patent pending nutrient suspension matrix efforsorb delivery system ) no meta-fusion ( patent pending ) ( l-arginine akg , citral-m ( citrulline malate ) , l-citrulline akg , l-histidine akg , rc-nos ( rutacarpine 95 % ) , gynostemma pentaphyllum ( 95 % gypenosides ) , nad ( nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ) muscle volumizing creatine matrix ( patent pending ) cem3 ( creatine ethyl ester malate ) , 2cm ( dicreatine malate ) , betapure ( trimethylglycine ) , glycovol ( glycocyamine ) , guanipro ( guanidino proplonic acid ) , cinnulin pf ( aqueous cinnamon extract ) , keto-isocaproate potassium ener-tropic xplosion ( patent pending ) l-tyrosine , taurine , endurlac ( glucuronolactone ) , l-tyrosine akg , methylxanthines ( caffeine ) , mct 's ( medium chain triglycerides ) , vinpocetine 99 % , vincamine 99 % , vinburnine 99 % phospho-electrolyte replacer calcium phosphate , magnesium oxide , potassium phosphate , sodium phosphate glycerol hydrating polymers potassium glycerophosphate , magnesium glycerophosphate , glycerola stearat
0	... intentional rip off ? there is no 50 minute work out dvd included . the pump included does not work ( after pumping air for 20 minutes straight does n't even put a dent on the deflated ball ) and becomes very hot after a while . i kept thinking the plastic pump is going to melt before the ball enflates ( if ever ) . the `` 65cm '' ball turns out to be only `` 55cm . '' i do n't know ... seems like a rip off to me , but amazon is not at fault , since the nautlius web site has the exact same description for the item . quality-wise , the tko cory everson fitness ball 55cm i got a while back was so much better . the plastic is n't so sticky , and it felt a lot more durable than the nautlius one , too

0	do not do not do not do not buy any products from the weslo company . i just received my `` weslo cadence c44 treadmill '' and have attempted to assemble it . the handrail holes are not drilled in the proper spots so that they may be attached correctly to the console . the customer service numbers are all disconnected . their website gives an additional number to call , and a recorded message tells you to either call the now disconnected numbers , or puts you on hold for about 2 minutes before it hangs up on you . i have wasted an entire afternoon trying to contact them . this company is a complete scam . if you are even considering buying one of their products , your money is better spent getting your head checked
1	i bought this from lifeline recently and it has been an excellent addition to my home gym equipment . i 'm not a person who travels back and forth to a gym each day . i also do not like paying an arm and a leg for expensive pieces of workout equipment that eventually become expensive coat racks . this workout solution is about as low tech as it can get . i agree with the previous reviews below -- you could almost make this one yourself . it consists of a strip of mesh webbing -- like seatbelt material ; two adjustable , quick locking clips ; handles made of webbing and plastic tubes ; and another piece of plastic tubing that locks the jungle gym into place when the door is shut . the equipment is simple , but sets up in seconds . the clips adjust quickly and are incredibly secure . it 's so simple -- but it really works . the emphasis of the instruction sheet and the dvd that came along with it , is in upper body strength . you can do chin ups -- by regulating height , you can work up from lifting part of your body weight to full body weight . for me , this was the best part of the jungle gym . my chin ups/pull ups have improved remarkably by using the device . body rows , push ups , and fly push ups are also possible . using the jungle gym , pushups take on a new dimension with a fuller range of motion ( like an atlas pushup ) and given the instability of the webbing , you also get more of a core workout . you can use the webbing for balance as well as to maintain better technique when doing squats . you can also make the exercises more challenging by using a fitness ball . you can do abdominal crunches by holding the handles and lifting your feet from the floor . some exercises ( full body rows and dips ) are difficult when attached to a door and lifeline suggests draping the jungle gym over a tree limb so you can achieve a truly vertical workout . i have not yet tried using this over a tree limb ... however , i was able to perform the dips with some creativity while attached to a door but it was not easy . this is not a full fitness solution . but when used in conjunction with weights and exercise bands , it really makes the home gym complete . i have searched for a pull up bar for a long time that is removable , but none of the current offerings fit the odd sized door frames and moldings of my 99 year old house . the jungle gym has worked . given the ability to do pull ups of varying difficulty , it has also improved my ability to do pull ups/chin ups over a short period of time . the downside of the device is that it requires a sturdy door and door frame . i would be leery of using the device is the door does not close securely and lock or if you are worried about the integrity of your house 's construction . remember , the jungle gym is strong enough to hold your body weight , but the door it is connected to has to be able to do the same . if not , you will find yourself flat on your back with a new home improvement project to do . remember too , that when your feet are touching the ground and you do pull towards the door , the weight decreases as you pull . this is not a defect of the device , it 's just the physics of the situation . ( with free weights , the weight is stable throughout your range of motion . with exercise bands the weight increases as the band lengthens . ) also , this is a great device for weight/circuit training , but is not really an aerobic solution . the jungle gym , along with a few exercise bands are ideal for travel . i used mine with three lifeline exercise bands ( 2 r6s and 1 r8 ) , exercise band door attachment and the lifeline triple grip handles . this yielded a gym that weighed less than two pounds , fit in my suitcase easily and allowed for a variety of body weight and resistance exercises
0	we have in the past owned an in step single jogger . it was n't perfect but it certainly met our needs . it always needed to be tipped back to change direction and it rusted a little because we left it outside . if we had stayed as an only child family it would have continued working but with the addition of another baby we decided to sell it . after being in transition for over a year and now that the weather is warming up we decided to get a double jogger for strolling . we purchased the in step run around ltd 2 jogging stroller in hopes it would meet our new needs . the problems of the single stroller seemed compounded in the double stroller . my husband had no problem getting it together but complained about the cheap caliper style break ... it does n't stop the stroller and barely even slows it down . it took him the same amount of time to work on the break as it took him to assemble the whole jogger . after that we placed our three year old and our 18 month old in it for a test ride . when placing them in we encountered our next problem ... the seats even at the highest point are super reclined . they wanted no part of laying back but instead were both utterly thrilled to sit far forward and mess with each other . as for the straps a six inch long safety label sewn to the webbing made it almost impossible to thread them through the front buckle . so off we set on our test drive . it was really hard to push and almost impossible to turn . after a while we figured out that letting the kids sit so far forward threw off the balance of the whole jogger . the only way to make it partially work was to let out both seats to the fully reclined position , criss-cross the shoulder straps and constantly yell `` stay down kids ... if you sit up one more time i 'm going to sit in it and make you push me ! '' well we got home from our test run and my husband pulled out the cardboard box and with a resigned air began the job of taking it apart . i do n't recommend this item . in all honesty our radio flyer pathfinder wagon does the job more effectivel
0	field in a bag claims to be `` the perfect way to get a baseball game going '' . while this may be true , the number of games you can actually play with this set will be one ( if the set even makes it through the game ) . first off , with these bases you must set up the field using the wooden mallet the pound a flimsy plastic stake into the ground . with one of my sets ( i bought 3 unfortunatly at the same time not knowing their reputation ) , the wooden mallet was n't even glued together , it had fallen apart so i had to just use the head . then when i put the stakes into the ground , out of the 3 sets i had , at least 1 in each set broke while i was placing them . to actually place the bases , the set gives you a string device that helps you measure out the field . this was handy except for the fact that it took me 10 min to untangle the mess and then when i went to second base realized the string was not long enough . granted , one could place 1st and 3rd and then figure out where 2nd went but the picture in the set-up shows that the string will measure the base ; however , it definintely is not the right length . after placing the bases the team is now ready to play . however , do n't wear cleats with these bases . the bottom of the base says , not recommended for use with cleats and boy were they right ! with our game we had tball children using the bases and even their little cleats ( and not all the kids had cleats ) tore them to shreds . our bases lasted about one hour before they were torn and the inside cotton coming out . it was very unfortunate seeing as though we purchased three sets and all were done by the end of an hour . this non-profit wo n't see that money again : ) so unless you plan on using these bases on the grass for easy set-up , do not plan on wearing cleats , and not playing a true game of baseball/softball ... .you would probably be better off buying the $ 8 flat bases for temporary use ( and they can be left outside afterward too ) . - just not impressed , sorr
0	do not buy this gun from hot import toys . that is my main point . it took a very long time to get to me ( 8 days ) and when it did , it was broken . not that it was shattered or it was jammed . it just did n't work . the piston seemed to be fine , the motor seemed to be connected , the gearbox seemed to be in tact , the batter ( although a little hard to install ) was charged , and the trigger was connected to the gear box . i thought that i could return it for either a working gun or just a refund . no . i e-mailed hit over 7 times over the course of a couple weeks . nothing ! i got no response , no notification , nothing . i continued e-mailing them because they did n't even post a phone number to reach them at on their site ! hit is the worst company to buy from ever ! from what i see and know , this gun seems to be quite the mpeg ! i would have loved to use it to its fullest with my friends but unfortunately , i bet you anyhting that hit will decide to wait until the 30 day warranty has expired before they e-mail me back : telling me of how the warranty time is up and that they are n't allowed to exchange my product . buy from airsplat ! ! ! trust me . this is a good gun . fast , accurate , good looking . do not waste a month of your time waiting for it to arrive , having to find its broke , waiting for them to e-mail you back , and then have to live with a broken , useless piece of potential airsoft gun . so trust me , do n't buy from hot import toys
0	if you expect this to play music by itself , you will be dissapointed . basically , each foot is a sqeeze horn . it 's not bad a plush but as a musical toy , it 's horrible
1	this is a better stroller than the other three ( all for one child ) strollers we have . very maneuverable and adjustable . it turns on a dime and seats adjust up and down independently . folds down very quickly . it 's great that the kids can sit next to each other .
1	this inflatable kayak is a hoot ! i bought one yesterday and did about 12 miles on the truckee river through reno in it with my teenage son . ( yes , i am incredibly stiff and sore , and he 's raring to go again . ) first of all realize that this does not handle like a hardbody kayak . close , but not quite . it is just a pointy rubber raft , after all . it likes to go down the river sideways or backwards , depending upon where the heaviest bottom sits . but , it can be easily paddled by one or two persons to float just like the real thing . about thirty years ago i used to have a fiberglass kayak and went down many rivers here in the western usa . i 've worn wool long underwear under a wetsuit to stay warm and have almost lost camera gear and food in rollovers . i kinda know how to handle a kayak . this sevylor should not be taken through anything greater than a 4 , depending upon the skill of the paddler . it rides like a typical rubber raft through crests and holes . it might be fun to play with solo in standing waves , but it would be hard to brace into because there are no foot/heel rests . there is no way to stay in it in a rollover . you 'll just get dumped out . on the practical side , it only weighs about 23 pounds , can be had for around $ 140 , inflates easily and quickly with a plunger air pump ( sold separately ) , is easily portaged around the rough water , has a very shallow draft , is made from some very tough pvc , is comfortable to sit in for several hours , is easy to dump water out of , cleans off quickly with just a hose , and deflates in a heartbeat to be folded back into the size of a medium suitcase . for us , it is perfect - affordable , handy in the waters we frequent , easy to inflate/deflate/store . i 'm thinking of getting another one so that he can have his own , and so that i wo n't get quite as splashed-on from his flailing paddling . he can also tow old mom on the wide slow parts . sue : )
0	at first they kept the water out of my eyes and were comfortable . but after 3 or 4 times they had some water leakage . i use them for recreational swimming at the ymca . but am already looking for another swim goggle . i hope you post this even though i gave them a poor rating . thank you , eileen
1	this is a pretty good quality pack for the money . it looks good and feels well built . the height adjustment is a little tricky to adjust until you get used to it . it uses velcro panels to hold itself in place ( plus a locking strap to secure it once it 's adjusted ) and you need to pull them both out to be able to adjust it up or down . it was very comfortable to wear over the course of my very first 2 day backpacking trip . my only real complaint with this pack is that one of the accessory loops on the bottom of the pack which was securing my tent to the outside of the pack ripped about 3 hours into the first day , which required me to figure out another way to carry my tent . fortunately there are plenty of extra loops/pockets to hold things and clip thing on with and i was able to use those to secure my tent to the pack . so you do get what you pay for but this is probably one of the better packs out there in this price range .
1	my husband and i finished off a bottle of wine before assembling the unit . : ) it only took us an hour and a half to assemble , and our kids were running around like a couple of nuts during the process . after we finished the assembly , we both took a turn on a preset program . the machine is extremely sturdy , quiet , and worked like a charm - just like a unit found at a gym . we 're extremely pleased with our purchase and would recommend it to anyone
0	this is not the same model i bought but it looks like it 's built the same way . i bought the inmotion trampoline by stamina and it was completely destroyed in under 3 months with regular use . it did n't have springs but had elastic bands that ripped off . when i called for warrantey information , i had waited too long , it is only guaranteed for 90 days . i 'd give it negative stars , but i have to rate it at least 1 star to get the review to show up
0	i previously owned and used the 5 mi . version to communicate with my wife while i am going to and from the school bus stop for the kids . from the bus stop the 5 mi . unit was iffy . i purchased the 16 mi . units thinking the little extra power and range would make for better receive at the bus stop . it was worse . we received no signal whatsoever , not a peep . do n't buy this unit . save your money and buy the 5 mi unit
1	just a really great sports toy for kids . my son is 9 and he is already pretty good at it , but it is hard to keep my 15 year old from stealing it and riding it himself . i would highly recommend the flowboard for lots of outdoor fun .
1	this has to be one the best protein supplements in the market ! and more importantly , the taste is just unbelievable ! the banana creme and vanilla flavors are the best . from a `` supplement facts '' perspective , each rtd bottle is packed with 32 , yeah 32g of protein , and only 14g of carbohydrates ! the total fat is 16g which might be on the higher side , again 6g of which are in the form of mct ( medium chain triglycerides ) that are typically burned as energy and are n't stored as body fat ! all in all , it works really good for me and if you are an active person like i am , you should prolly go get yourself some . ( gnc also sells this for like 3 bucks
0	i bought the chair for my mother . she really wanted the chair so that she can start working out on it . she loved it . it looks very nice , the size is alot bigger than what i thought it would be , which is a good thing . the only problem i have is that every time she uses it , one of the screws comes out and the arm comes loose . she is very disappointed with that because she 's afraid to use it now . i 'm not sure what can be done to rectify this problem , but it something that needs to be taken care of . aside from that , it took a very long time for the item to come in and i 'm very upset with the fact that we had to wait so long to receive it , and now she ca n't really even use it !
1	i purchased my leki nordic walking poles because i read somewhere that these poles would reduce stress on my hips and knees while walking . that is totally true ! i have a congenital malformation in my right hip which prevents me from ever being able to run or jog as a means for exercise . i do love to walk , but was hindered by the pain from my right hip . by using the walking poles , i am able to walk quickly without any pain at all , even though i am actually using more muscle groups than i would if walking without the use of poles . walking alone , a person only uses about 50 % of the large muscle groups . walking with leki nordic walking poles , one will use up to 90 % of all the large muscle groups ; this turns a simple 30 minute walk into a full-body workout without stress ! ! i would not walk any other way now that i own my leki poles !
0	this ramp is terribly designed for a skateboard . first of all , i thought this would be a bit larger . when i tried to go off of the ramp , my nose hit the front of it . not only is it not fun , but you need to weigh it down if you dont want to slide around . if you are considering purchasing this item for use with a skateboard , i recommend something else .
1	i am very pleased with the quality of the inversion therapy table . it is sturdy , reasonably priced , and it was easy to assemble . instructions provided were clear and concise
0	i received this trike with 3 flat tires . the 12 inch tire tube needed to be replaced . the valve in the other two tires were defective and had to be replaced
1	this is an item that will bring smiles to the faces of everyone except the person putting with it , as long as the control unit is in possession of someone else . it is also useful for true accurate training , but a little humor never hurts
0	i consider my dogs to be small - they are all around 25 pounds . i have had to tighten everything on the backpack to keep them from being too loose and i still feel like they are a little bit too big . i think that for a `` small '' backpack , that they are just too large . thank you
0	this pump did not work very well for me . must pump it with much force fast and is more of a hassle then a help . i wound up putting it away and walking my bike to a gas station instead
0	its light was okay , although it could not quite cover an entire page of a book . the main problem is it 's too shabby to survive a battery change -- so you will get just 40 hours of use before it runs out . also , finding 3v lithium batteries is not easy .
1	my 13 yr old wanted this and a waveboard for christmas . since his dad and i are divorced , he ended up with both . i got him the flowboard and he loves it . of course , i tried it too and was shocked to find it was actually easier for me to play with than his regular skateboard . there is no chance i 'm even going to try the waveboard , as i do value my intact bones . i 've been wanting to learn how to snowboard and this definitely gives the feeling of snowboarding , but without the snow ! it 's well made , fun and definitely a hit
1	i had a hard time looking for a larger helmet that would fit me , i even tried using giro altas ii but not quite . good thing bell triton fit 's just right .
1	these flashlights are made in china . that is not too surprising nowadays and is in no way an adverse comment on their quality and construction which seem to live up to what we might hope from a traditional american brand such as smith wesson . i have two of these and i expect them to last me the rest of my life . ( i am 60 . ) a tad expensive ( which is why only four stars ) but small enough to be convenient , bright enough to be useful and efficient enough to be inexpensive to operate . i bought these flashlights for use during blackouts but their convenience has me using them for illumination whenever i am fiddling around with cables behind the tv or under the office desk or inside the computer . the small size means they are easy to hold in an armpit or in the same hand as another tool . i also bought the red-led version for use in the car so as not to affect night vision
1	ca n't really go wrong here . a metal post , some rubber grips , and a couple of wheels . it works great , and was the cheapest i found . just a tip , if you 've never used it before , do n't try to be a tough guy and do a rep from your feet . you may be tough , but you might also hurt your back . start on your knees until you know for sure you 're a tough guy
0	i used this ball with exercise video 4 times . on the 5th day , my 16 yr old daughter was sitting on it talking on the phone and it exploded , sounded like a tire blowing out and the ball ended up with a two foot piece blown out of it not just a hole .
1	i purchased this snorkel equipment for a vacation in aruba and i used it for 4 days of snorkeling . i had always rented snorkel gear before and this was the first time i decided to purchase a set . i am very pleased with this purchase . the fins are fantastic . the design of this fin from us divers with the split in the middle makes it extremely easy to move through the water - it 's a great design feature ! the snorkel mask was comfortable and it never leaked . the set also comes with a great blue and gray backpack that you can store all of your gear in
0	the first unit was installed as directed and when it was working it was fine . the problem was it would just stop working and this was most of the time . i exchaned several e-mails with customer service rep pat . she was extremely nice and suggested i send it back for a replacement . the second unit was installed as directed and worked flawlessly for a couple of months . it now works a bit better than the first one . instead of stops working most of the time , this one stops working some of the time . i have decided to keep this one because of the bother and expense of shipping it back for a replacement . and who knows , the next unit may not work at all . not a good product for amazon to be selling . r lockwoo
0	the only thing on this that works well is the watch ... the altimeter , thermometer and compass even after being calibrated give incorrect readings ... the stopwatch is difficult to start and stop and reseting it to zero takes some patience ... it looks cool and the time is correct but it is definitely not a reliable device in the least .
0	i got the pedometer and from the start it does not work ! ! you have to physically shake it for it to count a step ! i 'm returning right away
1	i was surprised at how good this worked with very little uncomfortableness while sleeping . it didnt take much pressure on the toes to be able to get up in the morning with very little pain on my heal . had problems for the last 4 months before the thermoskin . have been using it 2 weeks now and am already trying to slowly get back to running . great product
1	we pruchased this tent for our annual car camping trip in northern mi , where weather is very unpredictable . we 've had other tents that took forever to set up , but this one was super simple . i think it too two of us less than 15 minutes to have it up and ready . we loved the size of this tent - plenty of room for our air mattress and gear . the air circulation was great , too . even in the heat of the day , we had a nice breeze keeping us cool , thanks to a miriad of windows . when rain came during the night , we stayed dry , though i would recommend sealing the seams prior to using this tent . overall , we 're really happy with this tent ( especially for the price ! ) , and plan to use it for several years
0	this pedometer is easy to use and pretty decent looking . those are the only good things i can say about it . it simply does not stay on . i , too , have had to use a safety pin to make sure i do n't lose it . maybe i have a defective device , but this is anything but accurate . i consistently walk a measured 5 mile route every day . one day the steps will be 5800 , the next day 12800 , the next day 10300 . which is accurate ? are any of them ? i ca n't rely on it . when testing the device for accuracy in walking 50 steps , it never got it right . most of the time it was over the 50 steps , 2 times it was way under the 50 steps . i would not recommend this one
0	i only had the gazelle for one month when the noise began . it started as a low annoying squeak but gradually the noise increased to the point where it is difficult to hear anything else . very annoying ! also , the calorie monitor is no where near accurate and the heart rate monitor is worse . while it is a low impact machine , it strains the ball of the foot because of the awkward angle of the pedals . this is not the machine to get if you want any sort of a workout . i am selling mine and buying an elliptical machine . do not waste your money
1	i recived the paint quickly and it as in great condition . i only had 1 bad ball in the whole pack of 1000
1	i originally bought the blue ( 5 lb ) , red ( 7 lb ) and the black ( 9 lb ) gripmasters for my 14 year old boys . the blue is a little too easy for gripping but excellent for exercising the ring and little finger . the blue was too easy for them so they did not use it so i ended inherited it . it is pretty habit forming and fun to use because the tension is light , this makes it good for use anytime , anywhere . ( i have used it stuck in traffic and it is also a good stress reliever ) if i had to do it again , i would have probably not bought this tension unless you have a very light grip , probably have started with the red . just remember that this is mainly for fingers and hand exercise so very easy to use for gripping , the challenge is working out the fingers . it is not like using the regular heavy hand grippers . it has increased my hand strength and grip just by having it with me and using it during the course of the day without planned workouts . great product , excellent for finger or hand exercise , good quality
0	i rarely get taken , but i did this time . one song played 50 times . no instructions . pad not in tune with tv movements . this is going to a garage sale or charity
1	i bought this for my neighbors little girl and she loved it ! it was easy to put together , just took a few minutes , and away she went ! great price and i got a big hug
0	well , first of all i ordered this product on amazon and they sent me something completely different , they sent me roller skates with the wheels side by side instead of the roller blades i ask for like in the picture . then when i sent an e-mail trying to exchange the product , no one returns my calls or e-mails me back , after so long of trying it 's already past the 30 day exchange policy . so yeah , if you want a better review , contact me so i can exchange the product
